00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay before I get started I want to
 
00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 align:start position:0%
bring up an issue that
 
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
yeah the ranking member and I have been
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
the last few meetings and neither one of
 
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
us had it exactly correct but it was a
 
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
it's a good teachable point and it's
 
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.170 align:start position:0%
it's a good teachable point and it's
about

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
how you how you make a motion on a on a
 
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.850 align:start position:0%
how you how you make a motion on a on a
favorable

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
favorable
 
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.530 align:start position:0%
favorable
um

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
idea that needs an amendment about how
 
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
they went first or second or whatever so
 
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.729 align:start position:0%
they went first or second or whatever so
here's

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
here's
 
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
here's the uh the script of how you do
 
00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:29.630 align:start position:0%
here's the uh the script of how you do
that

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
so you would raise your hand and then
 
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
say Mr chair I'd like to move
 
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.750 align:start position:0%
say Mr chair I'd like to move
OTP

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
1000 and offer Amendment zero two nine h
 
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
and then uh what happens is then we go
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
to the amendment to make a vote and then
 
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh depending on how that go turns out
 
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
then we uh either make a new motion or
 
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
so that's how that's how that's done and
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
we'll I'm sure we'll have an opportunity
 
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 align:start position:0%
to practice that sometime today
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.770 align:start position:0%

some question about uh uh the attachment
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
of uh appendix 2 I don't see anything on
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
that yet
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
is is that forthcoming
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
the thank you representative Tripp for
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
um appendix Q is the Crux of our entire
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
issue here and because appendix Q for
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
those who may not know is the uh it sets
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
forth all the regulations for tiny homes
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
including uh the the primary issue maybe
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
not the primary the Salient issue which
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
establishes the size of a tiny home
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
which is less than 400 square feet we
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
feel that uh since this was already
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
adopted in the uh the IRC the
 
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
international residential code those are
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
the codes that all building officials
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
will have to go by when these tiny homes
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh need to be need to be uh inspected
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
and and therefore including it in the
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
bill seem to upon further discussion uh
 
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:49.019 align:start position:0%
be redundant it already exists uh and
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
that was the issue at hand that's why we
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
considered I should say that's why I can
 
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
considered the amendment but I have
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
learned that it is not necessary now to
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%

to budget committee recommendations on
 
00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
warrant articles for the record I am
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative Diane power I represent
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
the towns of Brookline and Mason in
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County District 26. this
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
bill comes from a constituent request
 
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:39.299 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the town of Brookline formed a
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
study committee to examine the adoption
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
of an official budget committee the
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
chair of that committee brought to my
 
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:49.460 align:start position:0%
attention the following findings first
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
budget committees and some
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities are publishing
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
recommendations on warrant articles that
 
00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
do not include Appropriations or
 
00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:00.289 align:start position:0%
do not include Appropriations or
expenditures

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
furthermore the study committee was
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
informed by the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
Association that publishing such
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations is not consistent with
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute the New Hampshire
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association has published
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
guidance stating that New Hampshire law
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
does not authorize the inclusion of
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
recommendations by a budget committee on
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
non-money articles
 
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
with that allow me to introduce the bill
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill clarifies RSA 32 and that a
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
budget committee or an advisory budget
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
committee shall only provide printed
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
recommendations next to a warrant
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
article that includes an appropriation
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
or an expenditure
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
this bill before you is needed due to
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that when a budget committee
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
publishes a committee recommendation
 
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
pertaining to matters that are
 
00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:00.059 align:start position:0%
non-monetary they do so outside of their
 
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
statutory authorities defined by RSA 32
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
colon 16.
 
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 32 the responsibilities
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
of a budget committee or an advisory
 
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
budget committee is strictly fiduciary
 
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:19.340 align:start position:0%
whereas matters of policy and governance
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
rests solely with the governing body
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
according to the Hampshire statute it is
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
of significant importance to maintain
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
separation of both responsibilities and
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
authorities between the governing body
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
and the budget committee otherwise the
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
roles of each skip word and the
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
effectiveness as well as the authority
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
of each is eroded
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
in conclusion this bill clarifies the
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
duties and authorities of a budget
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
committee as it pertains to
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations published on warrant
 
00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
articles and delineates the separation
 
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
of authorities between the governing
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
body and the budget committee
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
committee members for your time and
 
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.630 align:start position:0%
committee members for your time and
attention

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
chairman I am happy to answer any
 
00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419 align:start position:0%
questions at this time if you will out
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
committee of Representative 40 do you
 
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes I just had a question we don't have
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
a budget Committee in my town so I don't
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
know how they work but if a warrant
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
article uh representative didn't have a
 
00:21:29.169 --> 00:21:29.179 align:start position:0%
dollar amount with it an expense or
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
Revenue with it but asks
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
who's voting in something that at a
 
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
future date will indeed cost money or
 
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
can the budget committee comment on that
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of this bill
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Porter could
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
you clarify your inquiry by providing an
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
example no I just was wondering if there
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
was a warrant that said we would like to
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
establish a uh commission to a committee
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
to look into building a youth center in
 
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
to look into building a youth center in
town

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
um and that was on the was the warrant
 
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
article and it would if it passed it
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
would it make money have to be spent so
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
that's the question that I have because
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
again I don't know we don't have a
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee it never comes up but
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
places that do would the budget
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee be able to say then the budget
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
committee does not recommend this
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
because the expense would be more than
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
we we anticipate or might be more than
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
we anticipate thank you representative
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
Porter for your clarification so
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
according to RSA 32
 
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
um section 16 the duties and authority
 
00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:48.539 align:start position:0%
of the budget committee is clearly is
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
out clearly outlined and there are four
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
um main functions of the budget
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
committee and the first is to prepare
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
the budget the second is to confer with
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
the governing body the third is to
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
conduct budget hearing and
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
um the fourth is to forward both budget
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
and recommendations upon special warrant
 
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
articles to the governing body
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
and that is articles that propose an
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
appropriation so RS in statute special
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
warrant article is defined and that's
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
any article in the warrant for for a
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
annual or a special meeting that
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
proposes an appropriation
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
so that would include a budget article
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
as well as a warrant article that has a
 
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.029 align:start position:0%
as well as a warrant article that has a
monetary

00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
monetary
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ViSalus
 
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh for taking my
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
question I think I know the answer to
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
this but I'd like to clarify it in our
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
town we have a number of Ward articles
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
this year that will be expending money
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
but they're not from current taxation
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're from taken from the uh the rainy
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
day fund if you will so there's no tax
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
consequences would the budget committee
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation in those cases
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
so you're referring to the case in which
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives lasalles for
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
your question so you're referring to a
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
Warren article in which there is an
 
00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.649 align:start position:0%
Warren article in which there is an
expenditure

00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
is that my understanding correct yes so
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
I I would say that under this bill that
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
the answer would be yes because an
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
expenditure is fiduciary there is a
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and furthermore an
 
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.630 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and furthermore an
expenditure

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
assumes that there was an appropriation
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
at one point in time
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and let me this is the
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
chair I I would uh I want to ask a
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to uh
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative Porter's earlier question
 
00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:15.710 align:start position:0%
representative Porter's earlier question
if

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.310 align:start position:0%
if
um

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
I know in Londonderry we have by by
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
custom not by Statute we have a
 
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:26.900 align:start position:0%
a rule that that already
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
includes this practice where if there's
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
no money being spent uh that the budget
 
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
committee is silent on the on the
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
warrant as as is the Town Council
 
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.850 align:start position:0%
warrant as as is the Town Council
however

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that prohibits members
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the budget committee or members of
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
the Town Council to speak individually
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
as members of the public either for or
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
against a particular Warren article they
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
just don't speak
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
as a member of the body on behalf of the
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
body that they serve
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
so I I believe that would still be uh
 
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.210 align:start position:0%
so I I believe that would still be uh
allowed

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
representative power is that correct
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the um the follow-up
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
chairman Dolan that is correct this bill
 
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
here pertains only to
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
what is published in the warrant
 
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:24.260 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
discussion conversations that is not
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill it's only what is
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
published printed in the warrant
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%

is not
 
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
does not come into play in this bill
 
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
as I had stated earlier it pertains only
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
to what is printed in the article
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%

power for taking my question you've used
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
the word fiduciary and I believe it was
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
also in the statute that you um read to
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
us could you I use that word in my
 
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.570 align:start position:0%
us could you I use that word in my
practice

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure it's being used in the
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
same way that I understand it so could
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.049 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:20.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.059 --> 00:31:21.730 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:21.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
well but it's it would be done
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
so she it would if it's not on the

the warrant contains the Articles if you
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
have traditional autonomy then that
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
those warrant articles are acted upon at
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
or like a slip of paper yes no ballot
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%

um

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
there are special items in statutes
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
example the adoption or to descendants
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
to you that
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
to rescind it it has to be on the
 
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.230 align:start position:0%
to rescind it it has to be on the
official

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
official
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
because that's the provision of
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
that question must be placed on the
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
official ballot to extent that's not
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:03.769 align:start position:0%
 
law

00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
to do that they took it off the official
 
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
balance so now to the thought that you
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
do it on the warrant at the time so does
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
the sb2 channel yeah after it's adopted
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
does it have a warrant is it beneficial
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
well you have a deliberative session yes
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%

budgets even if it was solely a matter
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
of increase or decrease in the town's

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
after concurrence by the town of
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
Conway's Town attorney the record of the
 
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
Conway Municipal budget committee vote
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
was removed from the war knockout
 
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:38.579 align:start position:0%
following this event one voter at least
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
approached The Honorable Frank McCarthy
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
a former member of your committee to
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
address this situation with a revision
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
to RSA 32 colon 5 VA
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative McCarthy working with the
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
assistance of legislative services at
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
the time and the municipal budget uh
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association representative
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
excuse me drafted a bill HB 1392 which
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
following a minor Amendment from the
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
state senate with the support of the
 
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
municipal Association at the time was
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
adopted this bill's legislative intent
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
according to conversation I had held
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
with former representative McCarthy was
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
unable to be here today as he's out of
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
town was to allow budget committees to
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
vote on and have those votes placed on
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
all warnacles regardless of the monetary
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
impact HB 1392 was passed on June 12
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
2018 and went into effect on August 11
 
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.630 align:start position:0%
2018 and went into effect on August 11
2018.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
former representative McCarthy and I
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
both believe that the 2018 revision 2
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
RSA 32-5 Colt VA provides musician
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
function committees with the authority
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
record their votes and have those votes
 
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
placed on any Warren article proposed by
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
the governing body and then I quote a
 
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:50.339 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill a bill can a budget
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee adopted under RSA 32 colon 14
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
May on its own initiative required that
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
the tallies of its votes be printed next
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
to the effective article
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
as you have already discussed I have
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
read the contents of HB 484 and it is in
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
my opinion designed to ensure the mdc's
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
recommendation can be a fixed to the
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
effective War knuckle only when the
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
warnockle submitted by the governing
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
body or by petition includes an
 
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
appropriation or expenditure
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
apparently the town of Conway has a
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
proposed Warnock article number 22 for
 
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:26.900 align:start position:0%
the voters the legislative body
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
consideration on April 13 2021.
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
this Warren uncle has been defined as
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
non-monetary by the town's governing
 
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.170 align:start position:0%
non-monetary by the town's governing
body

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
this article calls for establishment of
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
a short-term rental Expendable trust
 
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
fund utilizing fifty thousand dollars of
 
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
taxpayer Monies
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
for our purposes of the short-term
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
rental coverage if HB 484 were in effect
 
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.849 align:start position:0%
rental coverage if HB 484 were in effect
today

00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
this Warnock would be placed on the
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
ballot without a written without a
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%

to its designation is not on monetary by
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
the governing body as I understand the

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the common
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
Municipal budget committee has supported
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
this warnaco by a 1200 vote on February
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
10 2021 during our public hearing and
 
00:39:16.089 --> 00:39:16.099 align:start position:0%
that tally is listed on the ballot today
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
subject to possible stripping later due

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm Brian Rader I'm at my home in
 
00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
Brookline and I am opposed to the bill
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
um good morning I'm Brian I'm the
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Brookline finance
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
committee and a member of the Hollis
 
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
Brookline Cooperative School District
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
budget committee I am testifying in
 
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill because there
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
are many warrant articles that have
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
significant fiscal impact that do not
 
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
include an appropriation or a specific
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
expense for example in Brookline this
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
year we have a warrant article to move
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
grades seven and eight from the co-op to
 
00:40:55.569 --> 00:40:55.579 align:start position:0%
the town to the town School District
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
this would require the town to build a
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
new school and to hire more step
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
teaching staff the cost of this are
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
enormous but the article itself does not
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
have an appropriation or a specific
 
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.150 align:start position:0%
have an appropriation or a specific
expense

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
expense
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
there are several warrant articles that
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
change the way that funds are
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
established and affect the transparency
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
such as an article to allow the schools
 
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
to retain two percent of the unassigned
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
fund balance or an article to change
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
where the cable access funds are
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
deposited we have articles that make
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
changes to property tax exemptions for
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
the elderly and disabled we also have a
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
warrant article to change the town's
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
advisory finance committee to an
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
official budget committee
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
the voters expect the finance and budget
 
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
committees to take positions on Warren
 
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
articles that have a fiscal impact or
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
significantly change the way that funds
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
are handled or that significantly impact
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
our particular committees in particular
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
for sb2 school districts like ours many
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
voters go to the polls without taking
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
the time to find out what is on the
 
00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
warrant the recommendations printed will
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
be the only source of recommendations
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
for some voters
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the end these are only
 
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
recommendations and each voter decides
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
for themselves how much weight to apply
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the recommendations we do not need
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
conquer to micromanage our how our towns
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
are run and we should not restrict the
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
voter's ability to get recommendations
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
from their own town committees thank you
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and the committee
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:28.859 align:start position:0%
seeing that will move to our next
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh testimony from Cordell Johnson from
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:37.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again Cordell
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
Johnston for the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
Association and uh when we looked at
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
this bill we thought that this uh really
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
just uh restarted existing law
 
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
tended to agree that there is no that
 
00:43:00.609 --> 00:43:00.619 align:start position:0%
that budget committees should not be
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
submitting recommendations on items that
 
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
have no uh no monetary impact I guess
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
listening to the and so I was inclined
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
um we think the bill may not be
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
necessary but it may on the other hand
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
it may not
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
hurt to clarify you know if the budget
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
committee is submitting recommendations
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
on for example proposed zoning
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
amendments or anything
 
00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:33.140 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with with monetary issues
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
it may be helpful to clarify that they
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
can't do that listening to the uh prior
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
two speakers
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
um I guess I I do see now that it
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
um the bill says
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
um you can only submit a recommendation
 
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
if the article includes an appropriation
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
or expenditure
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
and there may be articles that don't
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
include an Express expenditure but are
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
still going to cost money
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
so I so to be honest I'm not sure where
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
that leaves me
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
um I guess I think it requires some
 
00:44:08.339 --> 00:44:10.309 align:start position:0%
um I guess I think it requires some
consideration

00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
um and if the committee is is taking
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
final action on all bills today
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
um perhaps this is something that could
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
be retained for further study because I
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
do think it is
 
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
um it's an issue that warrants some
 
00:44:26.819 --> 00:44:30.109 align:start position:0%
um it's an issue that warrants some
consideration

00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
Johnson any questions from for the nhma
 
00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:38.420 align:start position:0%
no questions next speaker will be
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
coming with the pronunciation I had to
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
unmute yes it's uh Tom Guillen yeah uh
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
Tom would you please state where you're
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
from and what is what your level of
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
support is for this bill certainly thank
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
you my name is Tom Gehan I am from
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hollis New Hampshire and chair of the
 
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
Hollis budget committee uh I am before
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
you this morning to voice my opposition
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh some of the reasons have already been
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
touched on by other speakers I'll try to
 
00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:17.099 align:start position:0%
be brief representative Porter asked for
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
some examples of uh non-appropriating
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
articles that would be relevant for a
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the budget committee
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Raider touched on a couple I would
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
add a few uh in addition to the elderly
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
property tax exemption there's the
 
00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
veterans property tax credit which in
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
our town can run to an expenditure uh of
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
approximately a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
uh just a few years ago we had an
 
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
article before us
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
that proposed changing the uh land use
 
00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339 align:start position:0%
change tax from the general fund in the
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
town to the conservation committee that
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
did not appropriate dollars but it
 
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
reduced uh our Revenue by hundreds of
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars uh Mr Raider also
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
touched on the Cooperative school
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
district of which he is a member of the
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
budget committee there every five years
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh in Hollis Brookline we see discussion
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
about the apportionment of net costs
 
00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:12.380 align:start position:0%
again that is not an article that
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
appropriates money but the result in
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
subsequent years affects appropriations
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
of literally millions of dollars
 
00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:21.829 align:start position:0%
of literally millions of dollars
um

00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
RSA 32 in terms of its setting its
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
purpose for the budget committees is to
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
assist the public assist voters and
 
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
prudent use of public funds I think it's
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
vital that budget committees are uh
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
remain able to make recommendations on
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
articles that do not expressly
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate funds but nonetheless have
 
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
tremendous Financial impacts on our
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
towns the other point I would make in
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
closing is
 
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.750 align:start position:0%
closing is
um

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
our budget committee and I think budget
 
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
committees in general bring a lot of
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
experience uh to town Affairs on my
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee we have a member I have a
 
00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
member who is retiring this year after
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
50 years of service to our town as a
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
selectman school board member budget
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
Committee Member and Myriad other roles
 
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
um these are the type of folks that
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
serve on budget committees our voters
 
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
and neighbors ask us our opinions on
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
these and want us to take positions and
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
in closing I think it's a good thing to
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
hear from our elected officials I don't
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
know why we want why we would I don't
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
know why we would want to suppress their
 
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.430 align:start position:0%
know why we would want to suppress their
recommendations

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's it for me thank you very much I

those who testify that was our I believe
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
the last person that indicated on the
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
sign-in sheet they wanted to testify for
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
the public for me he joined us joining
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%

so I see two new hands Eric power and
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
Chris Hyde in that order
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%

thank you for letting me speak in
 
00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
support of HB 484
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
at the Brookline 2020 town meeting
 
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
voters approved a warn article to direct
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
our select board to form a study
 
00:48:34.859 --> 00:48:36.710 align:start position:0%
our select board to form a study
committee

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
to determine the feasibility and
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
suitability of adopting official budget
 
00:48:41.569 --> 00:48:41.579 align:start position:0%
committee for our town and school
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
district for RSA 3214 I was appointed to
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
the study committee and became the
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
committee chair
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
during our work that started in May of
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
2020 did we did a lot of study on budget
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
committees we learned a great deal about
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
the roles and responsibilities of an
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
official Bud com
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
consulted with peer towns having
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
official beer official Bud come across
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
and we also consulted with the New
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association New
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire School Board Association and
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
we essentially became subject matter
 
00:49:14.089 --> 00:49:14.099 align:start position:0%
experts on budget committees by looking
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
at them across the state and learning
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
about them
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
and this year our our warrant actually
 
00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:22.859 align:start position:0%
includes a uh Warren article to look at
 
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
adopting a bud come in our town and
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's scheduled from March 27th and I
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
think in written testimony I provided to
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
a website if you're interested to learn
 
00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
more about what the study committee
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
findings were on the budget committee
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
so in this effort we consistently heard
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
that one of the roles of a of a bud calm
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
is to include recommendations in the
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
warrant only on Town and School District
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
articles that have an appropriation or
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
an expenditure
 
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
known as monetary articles
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the nhma guidance on
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
their website under Municipal budget law
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
under their frequently asked questions
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
it says the question is whose
 
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
recommendations should appear on the
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
Warren articles and budget items the
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
answer is recommendations should appear
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
if at all only on appropriation articles
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
the law does not authorize the inclusion
 
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
of recommendations on non-monetary
 
00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.309 align:start position:0%
of recommendations on non-monetary
articles

00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
articles
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
we also contacted their staff attorney
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
and got a prompt response confirming
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of the official
 
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
blood Com or fiduciary including
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
preparing and recommending operating
 
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:26.300 align:start position:0%
budgets making recommendations on money
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
monetary warrant articles and
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
periodically reviewing expenditures an
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
advisory budkom recommends on operating
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
budgets in monetary articles
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
non-monetary articles include those
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
involving policy and governance which
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
are under the purview of the governing
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
body generally a select board or a
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
school board these matters are outside
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
the authorities of a budcom as
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
prescribed in RSA 32.
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
in 30 RSA 3216 it describes this this
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
Authority and it points to the fact that
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
recommendations by a budget committee
 
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
should only be made on special warrant
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
articles in RSA 32-3 so the special
 
00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
warrant articles are worn articles that
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
have an appropriation so you can see
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
what the law is saying right now
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
examples of non-monetary Articles
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
include requiring estimated tax impacts
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
on Warren articles adoption or
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
rescinding of official balloting like
 
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
sb2 establishment of study committees
 
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
with no appropriation or expenditure and
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
amendments to Cooperative School
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
District articles of agreement with no
 
00:51:32.349 --> 00:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation or expenditure
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
interestingly our Hollis Brookline
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
Cooperative official budget committee
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
has included their recommendations on
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
all of these types of monetary articles
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
non-monetary articles over the past
 
00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:44.099 align:start position:0%
decade despite the warn articles being
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
clearly outside their fiduciary
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
authorities and responsibilities having
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
served as a board member on the Hollis
 
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
Brookline Cooperative school board from
 
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
2014 to 2017. I was disappointed that
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
the co-op budget committee continually
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
insisted to include the recommendation
 
00:51:59.809 --> 00:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
in Warren articles that were outside
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
their purview as you know the
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
non-monetary warrant articles
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
currently the language of rs30 RSA 32
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
does not explicitly prohibit a bud comp
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
from making recommendations
 
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
on non-monetary warrant articles in the
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
warrant unless you read all of the
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
pieces of it despite clear guidance from
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association and
 
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
common practice used by most budcroms
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire to stay in their
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
fiduciary Lane
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 484 provides the need of
 
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
clarification to RS RSA 32 so that a
 
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
budcom only provides recommendations on
 
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.059 align:start position:0%
monetary worn articles in the warrant
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with their fiduciary
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and authorities this
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill's proposed language makes it clear
 
00:52:39.849 --> 00:52:39.859 align:start position:0%
that Warren articles involving
 
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
governance and policy receive
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the governing body
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
and not from a budget committee thank
 
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
you for your consideration and I request
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
that committee members vote ought to
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 484.
 
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Powers there's a I do see
 
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
some questions from the committee I'll
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
let's go I'm still on here I'm sorry
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
um it's okay I'm sorry I don't have a
 
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
question at this time I'll lower my hand
 
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
I have a comment for the committee for
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
later thank you
 
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair but I think representative
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
Porter was before me okay representative
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
my hand always comes up first just
 
00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
because I'm a co-host it's my fault
 
00:53:28.859 --> 00:53:31.190 align:start position:0%
because I'm a co-host it's my fault
sorry

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore and thank you Mr
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
power for considering my question I'm a
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
little confused now by all this the RSA
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
that you list uh talked about that uh
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
said what
 
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
said what
um

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
budget committees can
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
comment on on the warrant article
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
does that RSA prohibit them from
 
00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:58.010 align:start position:0%
does that RSA prohibit them from
commenting

00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
commenting
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
in the current law is there specific
 
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
language that prohibits the budget
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
committee from commenting on items that
 
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
do not have uh expense or expenditure or
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue such attached the question for
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative Porter good question
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
the the language is not explicit enough
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
it's in the gray area in my opinion
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of this bill is to
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
clarify that if you have different teams
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
by different attorneys looking at it and
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
that's why it needs to be clear
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
that that's the case because that's the
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
practice that most budget committees
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
have been following but there are cases
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
where it hasn't been followed in the
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
state and that's what the purpose of
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is is to clarify
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
where the budget committee should be
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
making recommendations and where they
 
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.589 align:start position:0%
making recommendations and where they
shouldn't

00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
um that's that's my opinion of it
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay next we'll go to representative
 
00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
Maggiore and then representative Tripp
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
power for taking my question
 
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
um uh I have a I have an sb2 town here
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
in Northampton I served on the budget
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
committee uh so I have a little bit of
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
experience and I will say that our our
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
budget committee does not put its
 
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.730 align:start position:0%
budget committee does not put its
recommendations

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
um on the official ballot
 
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:16.609 align:start position:0%
um on the official ballot
um

00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
that just the way that it is but my my
 
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
question is maybe a follow-up or
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
piggybacking a representative Porter and
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
several others if if the budget
 
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
committee is going to invest the time to
 
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
discuss these issues and mine does my
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
budget committee spends an awful lot of
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
time discussing these issues asking
 
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
questions what is the harm with
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
providing if it's in statute at least
 
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
the possibility for them to include
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh their vote on this by saying because
 
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
right now as as we read it it says only
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
when the warrant article which which
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
only is shall which means you can you
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
can you don't have the flexibility to
 
00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
say uh that they may so I'm just curious
 
00:56:01.609 --> 00:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
why the objection to adding that if
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to invest the time and I
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
apologize for being so long-winded who
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
are you directing that question from Mr
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
yes this is a a challenging question so
 
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:18.059 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a line between what
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
the budget committee should be weighing
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
in on and what they shouldn't
 
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
and that that the uh the point of this
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
bill is to
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
you know establish what's policy and
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
what's governance versus what is an
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
expenditure and what is a an
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation and it's clear the the
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
primary role as in law is the
 
00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.099 align:start position:0%
appropriation and the appropriate is
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
proposing the budget and then and then
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
Weighing on on Appropriations that's
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
really the function of a budget
 
00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:46.970 align:start position:0%
really the function of a budget
committee

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
there are other articles that made down
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
the road almost every worn article that
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
you can imagine will could at some point
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
in the future have a potential tax
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
impact but until it gets to a point
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
where it's quantifiable
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
and it gets down to a number it doesn't
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
make sense to have a budget committee
 
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
weighing in on governance like if you're
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
changing your curriculum or your um you
 
00:57:11.569 --> 00:57:11.579 align:start position:0%
know you're changing you know In
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
Articles of agreement you're you're
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
making your school board larger or
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
smaller those types of things aren't
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
really appropriate for the budget
 
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
committee because those are really
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
policy and governance and if you have a
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
budget committee weighing in on those
 
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
you almost have
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
two governing boards
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and so this is trying to respect that
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
the governing board has certain certain
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh governance and policy issues that
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to weigh in on in the
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
budget committee has their uh Lane that
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
they need to stay in fiduciary and
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for this bill is to
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
kind of delineate where our budget
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee is appropriately commenting
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
and where they
 
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:51.059 align:start position:0%
um should not be commenting
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we have a question from
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you Mr
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
Potter for taking my question
 
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.690 align:start position:0%
Potter for taking my question
um

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
this is an SP2 issue or well it could be
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
an essential but uh
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'll use SP2 as an example
 
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
aren't uh this is the first session that
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
you delivered
 
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.770 align:start position:0%
you delivered
uh

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:24.059 align:start position:0%
things like increasing the size of
 
00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
school board or possible uh
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
things that will happen in the future
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
that might cost money to be discussed
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
governing United States rather than uh
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
people having to rely on uh
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
yes that is um representative Tripp yes
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question on that yes I
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
mean in an S we have sb2 in Brookline
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
for our school district but we have
 
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
traditional meetings for our town and
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
for our Co-op School District so we have
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
we experience all of the different
 
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.950 align:start position:0%
we experience all of the different
variants

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
variants
 
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
and yes at an sb2 you definitely have
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
the discussion during the deliberative
 
00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
session you have a discussion during
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
your uh your budget hearing
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of opportunity to learn
 
00:59:22.849 --> 00:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
about the uh about the Warren articles
 
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
all of the warn articles and so you know
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
the budget committee is can can provide
 
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
their opinion there's no freedom of
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
speech problem here because they can
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
definitely provide their individual
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
opinions and that's often asked at a
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
deliberative session or a traditional
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
meeting but what gets printed in the
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
warrant is important to follow the law
 
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
and the law is a little bit ambiguous
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
right now and that's the purpose of of
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
clarifying it to ensure that you know
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
everyone knows what should be going in
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
and what shouldn't be going in and so
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
voters can and do get educated at
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions and at traditional
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
meetings before they vote
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Davis do you
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
this is a question for Mr power
 
01:00:12.119 --> 01:00:12.770 align:start position:0%
this is a question for Mr power
um

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a tremendous amount of
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
difference between something that's
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to be discussed or
 
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be discussed and
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
something that is prohibited by law from
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
being discussed and I don't see how that
 
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
is not a freedom of speech issue once
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
you legislate that someone may not
 
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
discuss something
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
you're infringing upon that person's
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech and expression
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
can you can you explain to me how you
 
01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:48.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative stavis yes the this
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
um this bill does not prohibit any
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
discussion this this bill simply just
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
makes the efficiency it prescribes the
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
format for the official warrant that the
 
01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:02.579 align:start position:0%
warrant will only contain
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the governing body
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
when it's a policy and governance issue
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
the Warren article does not contain a
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
expenditure or does not contain an
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation then the budget committee
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
would not put a recommendation on the
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
printed warrant that does not prohibit
 
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
anybody from speaking about it at the
 
01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:24.059 align:start position:0%
meeting at the sb2 deliberative session
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
at the additional town meeting that's
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
all still possible and it's encouraged
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
to the level that it makes sense
 
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
but it just it just keeps that it
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
ensures that the budget committee isn't
 
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:38.339 align:start position:0%
printing a recommendation on articles
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
that don't involve an appropriation and
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
expenditure on the official warrant
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.799 --> 01:01:51.530 align:start position:0%
 
Gilman

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
Gilman
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
power for taking my question
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh my question is uh are are you
 
01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh because an sb2 town
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
has both a town ballot and a school
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
ballot uh if there's a warrant article
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
for the town for something large like a
 
01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
12 million dollar renovation to the rec
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
park and rec park and then uh
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
um on the school ballot uh article for
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
repairing the roof on the middle school
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
that's also for 12 million dollars are
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
you con is the concern here that both
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
both will be considered for the tax rate
 
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
of the town and one will be competing
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
with the other and rejected because of
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
that competition
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman the to clarify on
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
this the both of those Warren articles
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
are Appropriations they're proposing 12
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars so the budget committee
 
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
if there was one would be able to weigh
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
in on both of those and they would
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
provide their recommendations because
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
they're involving an expenditure or an
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's what this law this
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill is is stating so it's really when
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
there's not an appropriation and there's
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
not an expenditure it's not the it's not
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
the role of the budget committee to
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
weigh in and so for those two examples
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
there the budget committee would weigh
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
in because they're they are spending
 
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.770 align:start position:0%
in because they're they are spending
money

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative Mentor my my
 
01:03:23.569 --> 01:03:23.579 align:start position:0%
Recollections we have one more
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
additional member of the public that we
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
should speak
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
very good recollection Mr chair Mr Chris

name can you hear I presume you can hear
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
me now
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
um my name is Chris Hyde I am a resident
 
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
of Hollis I am a current member of the
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
Hollis budget committee uh prior to Mr
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
Guillen I was uh chair of the house
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
budget committee as well have sort of
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
done on that board for a number of years
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I speak in uh opposition to this bill
 
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
um we have heard from literally uh uh
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds of of our constituents in in
 
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
our town about the desire and need to
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
have input on a variety of different uh
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
things that come before the voters with
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
Rich do not associate in the article as
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
presented a monetary number uh uh to
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
appropriate or expend in that particular
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
year some of them are from petition
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
warrant articles that frankly are
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
probably malformed uh but others for
 
01:04:48.299 --> 01:04:49.309 align:start position:0%
probably malformed uh but others for
instance

01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:50.089 align:start position:0%
instance
um

01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
things like articles of agreement which
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
have been raised uh here before have
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
been uh and continue to come up
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
occasionally uh that will indeed uh
 
01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:06.020 align:start position:0%
necessitate a change in
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh expenditures and Taxation for
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
instance changing uh the composition for
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
instance of a uh a a class structure at
 
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
a Co-op level will wind up changing the
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
need to provide funding to do that it
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
may not be included in the instance of
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
that but it can be well anticipated that
 
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
there'll be an impact coming forward and
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
these types of things land use change
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
tax uh changes a variety of others that
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
have come before the voters they seek to
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a group that has a deep analysis
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
and vetting done and make a recommend
 
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
foundation and the reasoning associated
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
with this which is why they you know the
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
towns typically have established their
 
01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:03.299 align:start position:0%
town as a RSA 32 town is to get that
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
kind of insight
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
presented to the public and then they
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
can take an alternate view which is a
 
01:06:12.049 --> 01:06:12.059 align:start position:0%
good example we we made a recommendation
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
on a land use change tax in in Prior
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
year uh that would uh change and and
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
diminish the tax uh uh the revenues into
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
the town be applied to another uh
 
01:06:25.859 --> 01:06:27.410 align:start position:0%
the town be applied to another uh
purpose

01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
um and uh the town decided after hearing
 
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
it and welcomed and and was appreciative
 
01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
of the input from the budget committee
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
but wound up going in a different uh
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
Direction and that's fine but they
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear and know after the
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
vetting that was taking place by the
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
budget committee with time and deep
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
analysis an ability to ask the questions
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of formation of a
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
budget that they had this vetting
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
process and so I speak against this
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
article because all it's really asking
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
to do is to take away a an ability uh to
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
weigh in on appropriate articles that
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
will have a impact Maybe not immediately
 
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:17.780 align:start position:0%
maybe not
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
properly conceived but don't raise a
 
01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
dollar amount in the article but will
 
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
definitely have an impact going forward
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm opposed to this uh and uh I
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
hope you will
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
um uh defeat this um and send it back
 
01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
for study thank you well thank you for
 
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
your testimony we had a question for you
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
from representative Manchester foodie
 
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.569 align:start position:0%
from representative Manchester foodie
sure

01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:44.579 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Hyde for
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question so from your
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
testimony I uh correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:07:56.089 --> 01:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
this will fundamentally change how your
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
town budget school committee budget
 
01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:02.339 align:start position:0%
committee uh kind of changes or will be
 
01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:05.339 align:start position:0%
limited your constituents voice will be
 
01:08:09.490 --> 01:08:09.500 align:start position:0%
restricted am I correct yeah the uh
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
my view certainly is that with the
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
adoption of 44 as shown would definitely
 
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
change uh the input the desire from the
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
the public uh and and how the um the
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
budget committee uh acts uh in the
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
wishes or uh inputs from from our
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
constituents yes
 
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
and representative to 11 you had an
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
issue I think representative Tripp had
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
his hand up before me
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh I
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
keep hearing the uh
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
the first freedom of speech
 
01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.390 align:start position:0%
the first freedom of speech
uh

01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
during the discussion and that uh
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
removing the budget committee's ability
 
01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
to comment on the uh the ballot
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
uh will be a freedom and speech issue uh
 
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
the uh they're being to to comment or
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
provide a recommendation uh
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
is uh it's a freedom of speech issue but
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's more of a free event speech
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
issue in that uh there's no uh there's
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
no ability for the public to rebut that
 
01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.829 align:start position:0%
no ability for the public to rebut that
recommendation

01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh because they have no ability to make
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
a recommendation on the ballot I I still
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
contend that uh
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
these things that are are being placed
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
on a ballot or something that should be
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
done in either the delivery session or
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
during the town meeting uh what's your
 
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
opinion on this
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
is that for me yes Mr Hyde so I I didn't
 
01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
raise a freedom of speech issue in in my
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
comments uh but in terms of uh you know
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
the deliverer to either we are not an
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
sb2 town in the in our town or Hollis
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
school districts we are in SB uh or or
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
at the uh Co-op uh so um I I don't have
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
experiences in sb2 town but so all the
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
Articles get raised at
 
01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
um town meeting uh and there is ample
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for members of the public uh
 
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
to ask and it generally is uh asked of
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh the the budget committees uh in
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
certain uh issues you know why did you
 
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
make this recommendation uh and give us
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know the the top couple of points of
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
of analysis this is the type of thing
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is asked for and expected uh by our
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
voters to give deeper analysis take the
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
time to review and form some
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh and recommendations to them they're
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
free then to uh make a different call
 
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
based upon what they've they've heard
 
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
and occasionally do uh which is all well
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
and good uh but it gives the opportunity
 
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it has received a
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
deeper uh background and that people
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
know what the future holds maybe not in
 
01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
this particular year but if you change
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
the composition for instance of a
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
structure of a school district in uh in
 
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
different class sizes and know that
 
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
something is coming that will change uh
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
the need to raise taxes uh in one entity
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
or another or build a building to
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
accommodate or whatever that may be
 
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
then those are useful inputs that we
 
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
have heard time and time again from
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
constituents that they want analysis
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
done and inputs from the budget
 
01:11:50.219 --> 01:11:51.530 align:start position:0%
done and inputs from the budget
committee

01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:53.219 align:start position:0%
representative Philip did you have a
 
01:11:53.219 --> 01:11:54.229 align:start position:0%
representative Philip did you have a
follow-up

01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh I haven't asked a question yet but
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
yes I'd love to ask uh Mr Hyde a
 
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:00.169 align:start position:0%
yes I'd love to ask uh Mr Hyde a
question

01:12:00.169 --> 01:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
Mr Hyde thanks first of all for your
 
01:12:02.219 --> 01:12:03.410 align:start position:0%
Mr Hyde thanks first of all for your
testimony

01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
um this has been on my mind throughout
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
this hearing and you've seemed to have
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
spoken about it I want to clarify
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
are we talking about unintended
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
consequences I.E a bill that talks about
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
adding a different grade to a school or
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
changing the way the perks and
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
Recreation Department runs their winter
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
or summer program
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
but doesn't have any money involved in
 
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.149 align:start position:0%
but doesn't have any money involved in
it

01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
if we put this bill in place if there's
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
no Financial or fiscal
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
note then the budget committee can't
 
01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
comment on it and that strikes me as
 
01:12:41.219 --> 01:12:42.790 align:start position:0%
comment on it and that strikes me as
foreign

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
looking can I have your opinion please
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
precisely uh representative and yeah I
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
think you hit the nail on the head there
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
are a wide variety of different uh bills
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
both comes from from the the governing
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
body but also from petition warrants uh
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
that come that uh seek to do something
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
that will have a an impact and you can
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
know you know you knowly uh could
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
understand that there is going to be a
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
need to raise revenues uh somehow alter
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
those revenues from one place to the
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
other uh and give that input but there
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
is not an Associated uh dollar amount
 
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
placed in the uh the article and uh for
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
those things uh the voters have asked
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
kind of repeatedly to to have that kind
 
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
of insight from there we've been polled
 
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
at you know when we haven't made those
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations sometimes we get pulled
 
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
at the uh uh the the time however when
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're behind the the eight ball and
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
haven't really considered them before
 
01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
then doing a polling at the uh the point
 
01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
of of the annual meeting is not a very
 
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
efficient structure to give the really
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
good detailed analysis and consideration
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh and and provide that input to the
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
voters and so for those reasons uh you
 
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
know we we are opposed to this and it's
 
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences of what this
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to to uh propose thank
 
01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
you Mr Hyde
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and I have one last uh
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
before we close the hearing uh for you
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
example in Londonderry where the town
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
that I represent
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
we have a Warren article this year
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's it's going to say something like
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
should the town manager
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
issue uh a letter
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
to the Speaker of the House in Concord
 
01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
to make sure that any redistricting be
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
done in a fair and balanced man
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
that would be certainly a Warren article
 
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:14:57.050 --> 01:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
that this particular legislation would
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
be targeting that there's really no
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
point for the budget committee to take
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
an official position on a warrant like
 
01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
that like that's the truth yes I 100
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
agree there's if if it doesn't
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
ultimately result in anticipatively uh
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
result in a a expenditure and
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation needed a need to alter the
 
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
taxation of the residents there is no
 
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:22.460 align:start position:0%
reason to do that and and certainly a a
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
redistricting or otherwise for for
 
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
representation and voting or many others
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh to come before would have no reason
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
for the budget committee to weigh in
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I'm close the
 
01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.050 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I'm close the
hearing

01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:35.060 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:41.699 align:start position:0%

majority for introducing the bill for Mr

murder who's over at ways and needs
 
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
my name is George San Souci I am from

Lancaster New Hampshire and I have
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
worked with Troy merner the technical
 
01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
elements of this bill and uh wish to
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
very briefly I didn't Supply a letter to
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
his behalf on the technical elements of
 
01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
very very briefly the requests of the
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill is to create a study commission to
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
look at the unintended consequence or
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
differential between how the abatement
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
of an abatement is paid based on the
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
equalization rate that's used to set the
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
value of a property and the equalization
 
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
rate that is used to calculate the
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
actual abatement in the event of an
 
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.010 align:start position:0%
actual abatement in the event of an
appeal

01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
this particular issue is easy to explain
 
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
in one sentence what needs to be
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
accomplished but it's actually becomes
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
very difficult in the technicalities of
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
how it operates and there are a number
 
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
of different solutions uh to to fixing
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
this problem it's a bilateral it's a
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's a bipartisan unintended consequence
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
of how we do Equalization in New
 
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.550 align:start position:0%
of how we do Equalization in New
Hampshire

01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh the general consensus amongst the
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
various assessors that I've talked to
 
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
and with Brett myner
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
he best handled in a study commission to
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
bring a consensus as to how to uh how to
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
correct this problem
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh my letter does point out that it's
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
surfaced in in Spades so to speak at the
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
last uh big Public Service trial 95
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
communities where uh several hundred
 
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of unintended
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
value shift occurred in that trial
 
01:20:53.209 --> 01:20:53.219 align:start position:0%
resulting in approximately six million
 
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of abatements
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
that related to the equalization issue
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
and not the value
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
a property that was under appeal the
 
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
appeal portion
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
and that has raised the uh
 
01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
visibility of this matter substantially
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
I represent approximately 70 communities
 
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
and talking to you today as their
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
special purpose Assessor it is not just
 
01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
related to utility properties it is it
 
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
is something that is magnified for any
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
large property whether it is a flash
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
shopping center the new construction at
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
Tuscany build Tuscan Village in Salem uh
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
for a major industrial property
 
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:40.910 align:start position:0%
for a major industrial property
Etc

01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%

01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
you you
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
do not want to create any bills that
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
require committee activities
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
at this time because of covet so we are
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
asking in behalf of repurna to retain
 
01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh going forward for later on this year
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
and next year this is an issue that's
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
been around for a period of time
 
01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:08.870 align:start position:0%
been around for a period of time

01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
what we have demonstrated through House
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 700 that it consensus and some of
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
these tough
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
Equalization and assessment issues can
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
be reached so we would respectfully ask
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
if the committee would consider
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill until later on this
 
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.169 align:start position:0%

question I'd like to make a motion
 
01:23:35.169 --> 01:23:35.179 align:start position:0%
uh following your uh clarification
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning about the order of
 
01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
uh presentation of amendments I would
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
like to move reconsideration of hb512
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
and consideration of the amendment to HB
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%

01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
motion appears to be in order but uh I
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
would request that we finish this
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
particular hearing before we accept that
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
motion is that acceptable to me
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
to the Committee Member
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
um how would you like me to go forward
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
when the hearing closes do you want me
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
the hearing on 411 is closed
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
by the way the sign-in sheet had five
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
inch support and two opposed
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
and on the previous bill of 484 we had
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
four in support and 16 opposed
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
for those of you who would like to keep
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
track of them
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
hey next uh we had them we have a
 
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
ascending motion from representative
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
Davis could you uh
 
01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
State your emotion please thank you Mr
 
01:24:59.410 --> 01:24:59.420 align:start position:0%
chair happy too I would like to move
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of HB 512 and speak to
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment that that was offered to
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
that legislation which is amendment
 
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:14.090 align:start position:0%
that legislation which is amendment
0563h

01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
h

01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:34.669 align:start position:0%
 
a

01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
Vern Dolan
 
01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that that motion needs
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
to be done during an executive session
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
if it's already been heard
 
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.590 align:start position:0%
if it's already been heard
yes

01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.729 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
what I'm considering is uh what whether
 
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
I should accept that motion and go into
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
executive session or wait do we go into
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:00.490 align:start position:0%
some other bill
 
01:26:00.490 --> 01:26:04.550 align:start position:0%
some other bill

from the uh
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:23.580 align:start position:0%

so we're going to resume our session
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
we're in the in the midst of uh public
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
hearings and we've had a request by a
 
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
member a Committee Member to go into
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
executive session to reconsider a bill
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
from the other day I'm inclined not to
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
accept that motion
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
because we're not in executive session
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
now and that we should wait until we do
 
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
an executive session I went to seek some
 
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
guidance I went I was unable to find any
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to I am going to rule uh in
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
favor of going into executive session
 
01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:48.490 align:start position:0%
favor of going into executive session
now

01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:48.500 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%

01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
to deal with it right now with the 10
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
past tense and we still haven't done a
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
thing and I think we should have
 
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
consideration for the uh
 
01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:37.010 align:start position:0%
consideration for the uh
time

01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the video schedule to speak with us
 
01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
and I think we should focus on getting
 
01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:42.050 align:start position:0%
and I think we should focus on getting
these

01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
hearings back the motion to be
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:52.500 align:start position:0%

01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
McDonald I tend to agree however uh like
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
I said I I went to seek some additional
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
guidance and I was unable to find a
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable source for that guidance uh
 
01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
right away but uh I I am I am uh I'm
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
calling balls and Strikes right now and
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't have any definitive guidance
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
why I I can't take this uh motion of why
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
the motion would be out of order other
 
01:38:21.530 --> 01:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
than to your point that we are a little
 
01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
behind in our schedule for our hearing
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:30.780 align:start position:0%

response to concerns that were heard
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
during the hearing and also in advance
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the hearing about
 
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
um unsafe or inadequate housing spaces
 
01:41:35.330 --> 01:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
that may be found to house uh Indigent
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
persons in the state
 
01:41:41.689 --> 01:41:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh so we um acknowledge those concerns
 
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
and we put this amendment in here to
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
condition the uh release of emergency
 
01:41:52.330 --> 01:41:52.340 align:start position:0%
funding uh pursuant to our RSA
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
165 which which mandates that towns and
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
cities provide emergency assistance to
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
people who are unable to maintain
 
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
themselves it does not specify that
 
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
these people should be housed in any
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
particular way it simply gives Authority
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
it demands Authority from the towns and
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
cities to provide emergency housing
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
assistance or when people are unable to
 
01:42:24.169 --> 01:42:24.179 align:start position:0%
do that for themselves therefore there
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
is no concern about building inspections
 
01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
failing or not being performed and in
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
fact this bill HP 512 is designed to
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
keep people in existing housing rather
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
than to put them in sched to your
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
questionable housing as a condition of
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions on the
 
01:42:50.219 --> 01:42:52.430 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions on the
amendment

01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.629 align:start position:0%

01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%

01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:00.540 align:start position:0%

01:43:03.609 --> 01:43:03.619 align:start position:0%

01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
um said the testimony that we heard from
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
the lawyer from the legal assistance
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
um was the one who recommended this
 
01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:22.739 align:start position:0%
language to us for the amendment to make
 
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
sure it was clear that this bill was
 
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
only saying to the towns and cities that
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
this emergency funding is going when
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
people are trying to stay in the house
 
01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I you know I we all had the concern
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
about putting people into poor housing
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
and we all we asked those questions and
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
this was the language that came from the
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
legal assistance lawyer so I'm urging my
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to support this amendment
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
and to support the amended bill because
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%

going to fire
 
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
find housing or not this crisis exists
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
and this will only enable and help
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
our communities and to provide the much

bill does not create any new emergency
 
01:45:20.410 --> 01:45:20.420 align:start position:0%
housing assistance funds it's simply
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
prohibits towns and cities from
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
conditioning current emergency housing
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
funds on the completion of a building
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
inspection which many people in
 
01:45:35.689 --> 01:45:35.699 align:start position:0%
emergency housing situations are not in
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
the position do not have the authority
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
or the resources to carry out
 
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.169 --> 01:45:48.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:48.179 --> 01:45:48.890 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair

um
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
my comment is
 
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking a lot about
 
01:45:53.639 --> 01:45:55.250 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking a lot about
representative

01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:57.770 --> 01:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
Ayers commentary when we first heard
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
this bill and he um described what his
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
town does when someone is in an
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
emergency housing situation and he he
 
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
was pretty appalled that other towns
 
01:46:12.050 --> 01:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
just didn't do this automatically and I
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
I feel like
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is a vehicle
 
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
that will allow other towns to do
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
automatically what they're supposed to
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
be doing and we'll provide all of our um
 
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
all members of our community a level of
 
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
safety that even though it's in an RSA
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
is not is not being
 
01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.070 align:start position:0%
is not is not being
um

01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:36.649 --> 01:46:36.659 align:start position:0%
followed by all our towns so and again
 
01:46:39.729 --> 01:46:39.739 align:start position:0%
representative air your commentary about
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
how your town handled it and you were
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
you were incredulous like what do you
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
mean they don't help them what do you
 
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
mean they don't go to the welfare office
 
01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
what do you mean they don't get help and
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
my child may always do and I want every
 
01:46:55.490 --> 01:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
time to be able to say that thank you
 
01:46:58.010 --> 01:46:58.020 align:start position:0%

I'm looking at the RSA 165 and uh if you
 
01:47:08.209 --> 01:47:08.219 align:start position:0%
go to rsh 165 colon one the local
 
01:47:13.330 --> 01:47:13.340 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh section that
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
says the guidelines shall include but
 
01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
not be limited to the process for

application for general assistance Etc
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%

that the

there's a heating problem in the lob I
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
can't turn the heat off that's why it's
 
01:51:46.609 --> 01:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
getting a little warm in here so we've
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
been advised that they're working on it
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
but we're free to open the windows and
 
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
get as much fresher as we'd like
 
01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
all right so we have uh before us

who were not residents of Portsmouth
 
01:59:13.070 --> 01:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
the appeal made the assumption that all

the board members were required to be
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%

reads any local legislative body May
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%

02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
that it would read voting members of any
 
02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
local land use board established

02:00:57.229 --> 02:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
02:00:59.450 --> 02:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:01:01.250 --> 02:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative songs that you are taking
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
my questions so
 
02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
to be clear in the current statute
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:14.689 --> 02:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
in the bill prints out on line three
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
members members do not include the
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
ex-officio members
 
02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
just just by default or definition of
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
remember of a plan Accord is that
 
02:01:26.219 --> 02:01:27.649 align:start position:0%
remember of a plan Accord is that
correct

02:01:27.649 --> 02:01:27.659 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:01:30.649 --> 02:01:30.659 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and and the superior
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
court I think underscored this is that
 
02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh it is not specifically mentioned that
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
ex-officio members cannot be members of
 
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
that board so they assume they can be
 
02:01:44.450 --> 02:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
such members yes
 
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:53.209 --> 02:01:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte yes thank you
 
02:01:58.729 --> 02:01:58.739 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
Summers for taking my questions
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
can you explain the need for this uh
 
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
the ex-officio
 
02:02:07.260 --> 02:02:07.910 align:start position:0%
the ex-officio
um

02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
people that are placed on the boards
 
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
generally don't have on especially on
 
02:02:19.330 --> 02:02:19.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:23.689 --> 02:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
well well uh in contradiction to what
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
you just said uh the Superior Court
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
basically said they are allowed to vote
 
02:02:31.609 --> 02:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
if they're members of that board since
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
ex-officio members are not singled out
 
02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
specifically if they are a members of
 
02:02:39.229 --> 02:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
that board at least in Portsmouth uh
 
02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to vote Yes
 
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
it would be up to I know that you say
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
the state the Supreme Court ruled it
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
would be up to the uh planning board
 
02:02:57.290 --> 02:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
whether to allow it or not is it
 
02:02:57.300 --> 02:03:00.530 align:start position:0%
whether to allow it or not is it
enabling

02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
well I'm not sure exactly I think the
 
02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
superior Court's decision was to say
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the RSA does not specifically
 
02:03:11.689 --> 02:03:11.699 align:start position:0%
exclude them so if they're not excluded
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
from being members and voting
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
um they are allowed to vote and serve no
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions uh
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp I think you Mr
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that uh members of the
 
02:03:34.129 --> 02:03:34.139 align:start position:0%
board can be either elected or appointed
 
02:03:34.139 --> 02:03:36.770 align:start position:0%
board can be either elected or appointed
uh

02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:41.209 --> 02:03:41.219 align:start position:0%
does that mean that uh ex-official
 
02:03:41.219 --> 02:03:44.990 align:start position:0%
does that mean that uh ex-official
members

02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.729 --> 02:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
who are well I guess they're they're
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
appointed like I yeah I've been drawn my
 
02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:51.169 align:start position:0%
appointed like I yeah I've been drawn my
question

02:03:51.169 --> 02:03:51.179 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you uh revs and trip I
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
think you're actually right yeah
 
02:04:01.129 --> 02:04:01.139 align:start position:0%
okay uh let's uh let's go to uh is it is
 
02:04:01.139 --> 02:04:01.850 align:start position:0%
okay uh let's uh let's go to uh is it is
okay

02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
Cordell Johnson on the line he's uh he's
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.689 --> 02:04:11.699 align:start position:0%
yes good morning Mr chairman and uh
 
02:04:13.609 --> 02:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and yeah I think I signed up neutral
 
02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
and I also submitted a letter
 
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
explaining uh our concerns
 
02:04:25.370 --> 02:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
I really think the bill is unnecessary
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
because existing uh already requires
 
02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
that all local land use board members be
 
02:04:37.129 --> 02:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
resident of the municipality and in my
 
02:04:40.010 --> 02:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
letter I cited the specific section with
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
respect to each land use board
 
02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:44.030 align:start position:0%
respect to each land use board
um

02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
I guess I think it's pretty clear that
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
when the statute refers to land use
 
02:04:52.370 --> 02:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
board members it includes ex-officio
 
02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:54.109 align:start position:0%
board members it includes ex-officio
members

02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
um but if you want to clarify that I I
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
guess that's not a problem
 
02:04:59.159 --> 02:05:00.109 align:start position:0%
guess that's not a problem
um

02:05:00.109 --> 02:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
my real concern uh with the with the
 
02:05:07.729 --> 02:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
bill is that
 
02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
one of the people who come come within
 
02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
the definition of a local
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
board is a building inspector and most
 
02:05:17.450 --> 02:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
people don't usually think of the
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
building inspector as a land local land
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
use board but that is a definition in
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
the statute I don't think it's anyone's
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
intent that the building inspector be
 
02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
required to be a resident of the
 
02:05:31.070 --> 02:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
municipality uh because that person
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
usually is an employee
 
02:05:35.089 --> 02:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
and sometimes works for more than one
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
municipality so that wouldn't even be
 
02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:38.450 align:start position:0%
municipality so that wouldn't even be
possible

02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
so I have suggested in my letter that if
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
you are going to pass this bill you at
 
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
least make it clear that The Residency
 
02:05:52.250 --> 02:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
requirement does not apply to
 
02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
requirement does not apply to
um

02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:55.609 --> 02:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
to building inspectors
 
02:05:55.619 --> 02:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
to building inspectors
um

02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:00.649 --> 02:06:00.659 align:start position:0%
I would also take out the word voting
 
02:06:03.050 --> 02:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
and just have it apply to all members
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
and if you want to include
 
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh specifically include ex-officio
 
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
members I would do that
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
um because my concern about referring to
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
voting members is then someone is going
 
02:06:16.729 --> 02:06:16.739 align:start position:0%
to say well I'm an alternate and I don't
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
usually vote so I don't have to be a
 
02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:20.689 align:start position:0%
usually vote so I don't have to be a
resident

02:06:20.689 --> 02:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
resident
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
um so I think you want the broadest
 
02:06:25.729 --> 02:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
possible language in there to make it
 
02:06:27.790 --> 02:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
clear that all members
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
are required to be residents of the
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
municipality I'll stop there and be
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions
 
02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
I I just one other thing I should add
 
02:06:42.649 --> 02:06:42.659 align:start position:0%
ex-officio members are expected to vote
 
02:06:42.659 --> 02:06:43.430 align:start position:0%
ex-officio members are expected to vote
um

02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:45.709 --> 02:06:45.719 align:start position:0%
on any matter that comes before the
 
02:06:45.719 --> 02:06:47.510 align:start position:0%
on any matter that comes before the
board

02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.729 --> 02:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
seeing none do we have Mr Brighton on
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%

and I support house bill 392.

02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
I've seen a lot of changes in Portsmouth
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
in my 68 years
 
02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
and as part of those changes in July of
 
02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:23.270 align:start position:0%
and as part of those changes in July of
2018

02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
2018
 
02:07:25.490 --> 02:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
the Portsmouth Housing Authority
 
02:07:28.490 --> 02:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
the PHA came before our planning board
 
02:07:32.330 --> 02:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
with a proposal of 64 unit Workforce
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
housing project at 140 Court Street in
 
02:07:35.099 --> 02:07:36.470 align:start position:0%
housing project at 140 Court Street in
Portsmouth

02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
which is right next door to the feaster
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
apartments which is for uh to get
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
elderly and disabled
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
many concerns were raised by community
 
02:07:48.649 --> 02:07:48.659 align:start position:0%
members density
 
02:07:52.070 --> 02:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
changing neighborhood character
 
02:07:56.290 --> 02:07:56.300 align:start position:0%
the the PHA came looking for various uh
 
02:07:59.689 --> 02:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
variances and a conditional use permit
 
02:08:02.209 --> 02:08:02.219 align:start position:0%
a colleague and I went to the meeting we
 
02:08:03.850 --> 02:08:03.860 align:start position:0%
were only at that point concerned about
 
02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh the way they were using the
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
definition of Workforce housing
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
we expressed our opinion and the
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
planning board gave the PHA what they
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
day my friend and I were talking and we
 
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
realized that the ex-official member of
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Deputy city manager
 
02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
lived in Kittery
 
02:08:28.010 --> 02:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
and that just didn't make sense didn't
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
seem right
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't until later that we
 
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
learned that uh another ex-officio
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
member the assistant city manager was a
 
02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
resident of uh stratum
 
02:08:40.970 --> 02:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
we expressed Our concern to the city
 
02:08:44.089 --> 02:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
legal department and they replied
 
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
when a board member is appointed ex
 
02:08:49.129 --> 02:08:49.139 align:start position:0%
officio it is not the individual who
 
02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
serves in that position rather it is the
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
position that has been appointed to the
 
02:08:55.070 --> 02:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
planning boy
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
while people have uh residences
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.129 --> 02:09:04.139 align:start position:0%
we move to take the city to court we
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
knew that uh it would be prohibitively
 
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
expensive to hire an attorney so we
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
decided to do it pro se
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
we did find a friend as a sympathetic
 
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
lawyer who wrote briefs and uh motions
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
pro bono
 
02:09:22.189 --> 02:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
we were joined by 16 residents of the
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
feast requirements
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
I I have to tell you there is nothing
 
02:09:30.290 --> 02:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
quite like having a superior court judge
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
pepper you with questions it is kind of
 
02:09:36.050 --> 02:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
like walking on hot coals please
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
the Sperry Court found for the city on
 
02:09:40.129 --> 02:09:40.139 align:start position:0%
all of our issues
 
02:09:42.589 --> 02:09:42.599 align:start position:0%
now the one relevant to this committee
 
02:09:45.609 --> 02:09:45.619 align:start position:0%
uh the judge agreed that people have
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
residences positions to know
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
Mia Layman the legal reasoning seemed
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
extraordinary extraordinarily obtuse
 
02:09:59.450 --> 02:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
uh legislative intent seems pretty darn
 
02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
clear to me
 
02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:01.910 align:start position:0%
clear to me
uh

02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
RSA 672 uh 0.8 States in part to serve
 
02:10:10.609 --> 02:10:10.619 align:start position:0%
on a planning board a person must be a
 
02:10:13.370 --> 02:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
resident of the municipality
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
we filed with the Supreme Court
 
02:10:18.169 --> 02:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
mainly on the residency issue
 
02:10:20.209 --> 02:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
I was fully prepared to stand before the
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
five justices and plead the uh plead the
 
02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:24.169 align:start position:0%
five justices and plead the uh plead the
case

02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's how important this is to me
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
the pandemic ensued
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
and because of the pandemic
 
02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
the court uh based its ruling on
 
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
just the briefs alone no oral arguments
 
02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
were heard
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
they affirmed the Superior Court ruling
 
02:10:45.890 --> 02:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
stating in part however we conclude that
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
even if the non-resident members were
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
ineligible to be ex-officio Boyd members
 
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
their votes were harmless in other words
 
02:10:56.330 --> 02:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
it passed by enough of a majority to
 
02:10:58.729 --> 02:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
that their votes can matter
 
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
in other words the Supreme Court
 
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
sidestepped the issue which only now
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
leads the legislative remedy
 
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's why I would like to see House
 
02:11:12.649 --> 02:11:12.659 align:start position:0%
Bill 392 become law
 
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
people making decisions affecting the
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
character of a municipality need to be
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
residents they need to have skin in the
 
02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:20.810 align:start position:0%
residents they need to have skin in the
game

02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
game
 
02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:26.830 --> 02:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions uh
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp thank you Mr chair
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my uh uh question
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Samson
 
02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:36.350 align:start position:0%
representative Samson
uh

02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
I find your the logic that the judge
 
02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
used to be quite interesting
 
02:11:43.609 --> 02:11:43.619 align:start position:0%
people have resonances but positions do
 
02:11:43.619 --> 02:11:44.450 align:start position:0%
people have resonances but positions do
not

02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:46.490 align:start position:0%
not
well

02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
following that logic
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
How would
 
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
this bill correctly ex-official
 
02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
problem since it's still a position and
 
02:11:59.209 --> 02:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
they still
 
02:12:02.209 --> 02:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
still uh
 
02:12:06.649 --> 02:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:06.659 --> 02:12:07.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:12:07.550 --> 02:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
the representative critique effort to
 
02:12:13.729 --> 02:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
mention his question uh you you raise a
 
02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
really excellent point and as you could
 
02:12:19.129 --> 02:12:19.139 align:start position:0%
hear from Mr Brighton
 
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
um the just the quartz kind of sidestep
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
that issue but you know hypothetically
 
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
if if a position is an appointment then
 
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
somebody living in Florida could serve
 
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
on on a planning board in Portsmouth and
 
02:12:37.070 --> 02:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
be a boating member even though they are
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
kind of disconnected from their
 
02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
neighborhood uh and I I agree with uh Mr
 
02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
cordelli's suggestion that if you do
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
um consider this this bill uh to be
 
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
worthy of passing definitely building
 
02:12:54.649 --> 02:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
inspectors should be Exempted from this
 
02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
rule because that that's a different
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
entity altogether however in order for
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
us to clarify whether ex-official
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
members uh are voting members really uh
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
the only way to do that would be to
 
02:13:10.490 --> 02:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
specifically say that while they can
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
serve on these boards and make give
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
advice to the board uh if they're not
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
residents of that municipality they
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
should not be voting because
 
02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:21.169 align:start position:0%
should not be voting because
uh

02:13:21.169 --> 02:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
they might have less less knowledge and
 
02:13:25.850 --> 02:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
less information than someone who lives
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
in town so um that is kind of our
 
02:13:31.729 --> 02:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
feeling about this
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from the
 
02:13:36.530 --> 02:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
committee any questions from the public
 
02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:13:40.250 --> 02:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
manager do you see anyone from the
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
public I do not see any hands up from
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
the public I do see one hand up from
 
02:13:46.669 --> 02:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative tree Levin representative
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
11 please ask me a question thank you Mr
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh this is for Mr Brighton
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
Mr Brighton thank you for coming to us
 
02:13:58.370 --> 02:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
and testifying today I'm wondering you
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned having skin in the game and my
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
thought is doesn't a person who is an
 
02:14:06.530 --> 02:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
employee of the municipality city or
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
town have skin in the game simply by the
 
02:14:13.129 --> 02:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
fact that they are employed by that city
 
02:14:15.370 --> 02:14:15.380 align:start position:0%
or town
 
02:14:19.010 --> 02:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh representative 11 I would have to say
 
02:14:20.990 --> 02:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
no they don't have skin in the game and
 
02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
I can give you an example
 
02:14:26.209 --> 02:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
uh if you're from out of town and let's
 
02:14:28.330 --> 02:14:28.340 align:start position:0%
say that you have to drive in every day
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
and and parking is an issue and let's
 
02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
say something comes before the uh
 
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
planning board then your view might be
 
02:14:39.410 --> 02:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
entirely different because you might
 
02:14:42.490 --> 02:14:42.500 align:start position:0%
need to find parking as an employee
 
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
whereas if I'm a resident I might have
 
02:14:47.450 --> 02:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
an entirely different perspective on it
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
because you know I can park and probably
 
02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
walk into town uh or you know in other
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
words there are instances many instances
 
02:15:01.250 --> 02:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
in which uh an ex-official non-resident
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
might not have skin in the game
 
02:15:06.729 --> 02:15:06.739 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair yes please go ahead
 
02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Brighton I appreciate your
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
point of view yet
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
I would think that someone who is
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
employed by a municipality
 
02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
has some understanding of that
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
municipality its workings and has some
 
02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
loyalties and concerns
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
in regards to the municip I'm sorry I
 
02:15:31.729 --> 02:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
can't talk this morning municipality
 
02:15:31.739 --> 02:15:33.410 align:start position:0%
can't talk this morning municipality
itself

02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:15:36.609 --> 02:15:36.619 align:start position:0%
over and above their own personal
 
02:15:39.649 --> 02:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
points of view
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
one would hope so but we're talking
 
02:15:46.510 --> 02:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
about human beings and uh it's we have
 
02:15:50.290 --> 02:15:50.300 align:start position:0%
uh people in town who are
 
02:15:52.970 --> 02:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
the planning board department head lives
 
02:15:54.169 --> 02:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
in Newburyport
 
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know her perspective of what is
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
good for Portsmouth might not line up
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
with a residence just by virtue of being
 
02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:03.530 align:start position:0%
with a residence just by virtue of being
human

02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
human
 
02:16:06.290 --> 02:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
it can be that simple
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh I thank you for your response
 
02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
Mr Brighton thank you representative
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair I'm not sure
 
02:16:17.810 --> 02:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
who this question should be directed
 
02:16:20.569 --> 02:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
towards my question is
 
02:16:23.209 --> 02:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
um does this bill create two types of
 
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
ex-officio members that is a non-coding
 
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:30.380 align:start position:0%
ex-officio member as well as a voting
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
ex-officio member based on residency
 
02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:35.570 align:start position:0%
ex-officio member based on residency
um

02:16:35.570 --> 02:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
the chairman can I take that question
 
02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
yeah who is that speaking representative
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
yeah go right ahead uh thank you
 
02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative power for that question
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
which is very astute
 
02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:47.870 align:start position:0%
which is very astute
um

02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
I think it doesn't necessarily do that
 
02:16:54.650 --> 02:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
because if if in fact you pass this bill
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
and in the municipality knows that Oni
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
ex-officio members who live in town can
 
02:17:04.610 --> 02:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
be voting members they will most likely
 
02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
appoint people as of ex-officio members
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
to that board who live in town which
 
02:17:14.089 --> 02:17:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.099 --> 02:17:22.250 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:17:22.250 --> 02:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.530 --> 02:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
um to check my understanding what the
 
02:17:28.129 --> 02:17:28.139 align:start position:0%
bill has written will do
 
02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
is that it will specify that
 
02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
ex official members
 
02:17:36.889 --> 02:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
shall be presidents
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
of the municipality and therefore they
 
02:17:47.450 --> 02:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh represent power I would I would add
 
02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:17:54.650 --> 02:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
um that the it does not preclude a
 
02:17:57.889 --> 02:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
municipality from appointing someone as
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
an effects of physio member who has a
 
02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
lot of experience and background in
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
these issues who may be live in a
 
02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.519 align:start position:0%
different town however they can give the
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
advice to the members of the board they
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
just don't have voting rights at that
 
02:18:12.479 --> 02:18:14.389 align:start position:0%
just don't have voting rights at that
point

02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:18:14.399 --> 02:18:15.589 align:start position:0%
point
issue

02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
are there any other further questions
 
02:18:21.770 --> 02:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
on uh on this bill
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
before we close to here
 
02:18:27.310 --> 02:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm gonna close the hearing
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 392.
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
next bill we're going to take up in our
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
hearing process well let me ask this
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
does anybody need a bio break or would
 
02:18:40.969 --> 02:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
you like a recess for five minutes or do
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay so you know uh
 
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
no looks of distress in anybody's face
 
02:18:51.049 --> 02:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move forward on House Bill
 
02:18:55.009 --> 02:18:55.019 align:start position:0%
374 and I'm going to ask representative
 
02:18:56.929 --> 02:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
power to introduce
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
the bill that is relative to the
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
official ballot referendum form of town
 
02:19:13.849 --> 02:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
meetings which is more commonly known as
 
02:19:16.490 --> 02:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.889 --> 02:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative power
 
02:19:21.049 --> 02:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you to
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
my fellow committee members I appreciate
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to introduce to you
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 374 relative to the adoption
 
02:19:31.849 --> 02:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
of sb2
 
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
for the record I am representative Diane
 
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
power I represent the towns of Brookline
 
02:19:39.169 --> 02:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
and Mason in Hillsborough County
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
District 26. first I would like to
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
provide some background
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
again this bill comes from a a request
 
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
by a number of constituents
 
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the method to adopt sb2 was
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
changed by removing the question from
 
02:19:59.330 --> 02:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
the official ballot and instead placing
 
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
the question on the warrant to be voted
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
upon at the annual meeting
 
02:20:07.870 --> 02:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the previous House Bill
 
02:20:10.370 --> 02:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
asserted that voters should not be
 
02:20:13.730 --> 02:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote on sb2 at the Town polls
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
because they might be uninformed voters
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
with that allow me to introduce the bill
 
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
this bill restores the original method
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
of adopting sb2 by placing the question
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
on the official ballots and it allows
 
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
all-day voting at Town polls on Town
 
02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
election day
 
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
or by absentee ballot this bill before
 
02:20:39.290 --> 02:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
you is needed to address a number of
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
issues resulting from the recent
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
statutory changes first
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
the traditional meeting is not the only
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
time and place to hear about SP2
 
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
this bill recognizes the ample
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities for one to be informed on
 
02:20:58.200 --> 02:20:59.450 align:start position:0%
opportunities for one to be informed on
sb2

02:20:59.450 --> 02:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
sb2
 
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
which are already prescribed by law
 
02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
initially when the question to adopt sb2
 
02:21:08.570 --> 02:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
was brought forward the governing body
 
02:21:11.809 --> 02:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
discusses it at a regular meeting at
 
02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
which public input is included once on
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
the warrants there is a hearing on the
 
02:21:21.410 --> 02:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
sb2 question as required by law moreover
 
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
in multi-town districts a hearing must
 
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.250 --> 02:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
so the system already has
 
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
two opportunities to become informed on
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
and debate sb2
 
02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
furthermore by putting the question to
 
02:21:48.889 --> 02:21:48.899 align:start position:0%
adopt sb2 on the official ballot voters
 
02:21:51.889 --> 02:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
have more time to consider the pros and
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
cons of SP2 than they would otherwise
 
02:21:58.250 --> 02:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
have at the traditional town meeting
 
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
second and most importantly
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
this bill eliminates the control of a
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
minority present at an annual meeting to
 
02:22:10.370 --> 02:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to adopt the sv2
 
02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:11.270 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to adopt the sv2
system

02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
by placing the question to adopt sv2
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
back onto the official ballot and
 
02:22:19.550 --> 02:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
allowing for an all-day vote voter
 
02:22:22.969 --> 02:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
participation is increased this also
 
02:22:25.969 --> 02:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
protects against disenfranchising voters
 
02:22:29.690 --> 02:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
like the elderly disabled deployed

02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:39.180 align:start position:0%

02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
meeting to vote on sb2
 
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
also the complexities of covid-19 moving
 
02:22:48.889 --> 02:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
forward only adds to the participation
 
02:22:48.899 --> 02:22:50.110 align:start position:0%
forward only adds to the participation
challenge

02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly when more people are able to
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
vote on the question to adopt sb2 the
 
02:22:59.870 --> 02:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
vote better represents the will of the
 
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
people and third this bill undoes the
 
02:23:06.770 --> 02:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
inequitable standards to adopt and to
 
02:23:08.809 --> 02:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
rescind sb2
 
02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
by placing the question to adopt back
 
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
onto the official ballot the method to
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
adopt sb2 is the same as the method to
 
02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:19.969 align:start position:0%
adopt sb2 is the same as the method to
resent

02:23:19.969 --> 02:23:19.979 align:start position:0%
resent
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
reverses the recent changes made to
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
adopt sb2 reverting back to the original
 
02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:31.010 align:start position:0%
adopt sb2 reverting back to the original
language

02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:23:33.530 --> 02:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
it acknowledges the many opportunities
 
02:23:35.929 --> 02:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
already available for voters to become
 
02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
informed on SP2 and it enables greater
 
02:23:42.770 --> 02:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
voter participation on the question to
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
adopt sb2 thus better representing the
 
02:23:47.809 --> 02:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
will of the people
 
02:23:50.210 --> 02:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:23:52.130 --> 02:23:52.140 align:start position:0%

attention Mr chairman I am happy to
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions at this time if you
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
allow uh thank you representative
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Porter you had a question
 
02:24:04.610 --> 02:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
oh yes thank you Mr chair I rep think
 
02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Powell for
 
02:24:09.050 --> 02:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question on this
 
02:24:11.090 --> 02:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
um you had a list of
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
um people who were unable to attend Town
 
02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:15.770 align:start position:0%
um people who were unable to attend Town
meetings

02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um quite a lengthy list and I agree with
 
02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:19.070 align:start position:0%
um quite a lengthy list and I agree with
you

02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
um but when if sb2 is adopted by a
 
02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
community won't those same people be
 
02:24:28.130 --> 02:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
hindered from getting to the business uh
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
portion of the sb2 and therefore not be
 
02:24:33.530 --> 02:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
able to make their
 
02:24:36.410 --> 02:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
which is known to the community prior to
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Porter the focus of this
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
bill is not
 
02:24:46.610 --> 02:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the merits
 
02:24:51.770 --> 02:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
of the sb2 system it simply focuses on
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
the method to
 
02:24:59.090 --> 02:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
um adopt SP2 whether that take place on
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
the official ballot
 
02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
to be voted upon at the Town polls which
 
02:25:08.510 --> 02:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
um in order to participate in that way
 
02:25:11.389 --> 02:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
that takes obviously less time than it
 
02:25:14.050 --> 02:25:14.060 align:start position:0%
would for someone to
 
02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
need to attend a traditional meeting in
 
02:25:19.929 --> 02:25:19.939 align:start position:0%
order to
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
vote on that question
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up Mr chair yes
 
02:25:27.950 --> 02:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
please go ahead thank you representative
 
02:25:31.130 --> 02:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
um in the traditional town meeting form
 
02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
of government all decisions are made at
 
02:25:38.450 --> 02:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
the town meeting the only thing that's
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
on the ballot are offices and occasional
 
02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:44.300 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
but all the rest of the decisions made
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
at the meeting
 
02:25:51.290 --> 02:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
all the rest of the decisions are made
 
02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
at the meeting by
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
making it possible to decide on this
 
02:25:59.570 --> 02:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
very important issue
 
02:26:01.849 --> 02:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
not at the meeting if someone's already
 
02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
in a town meeting mode of government
 
02:26:05.929 --> 02:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
you're giving them you're changing how
 
02:26:08.270 --> 02:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
they make their decisions by putting
 
02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
this decision on an official ballot
 
02:26:17.389 --> 02:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
does that inconsistency ring true to you
 
02:26:18.889 --> 02:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative Porter um I'm not sure
 
02:26:23.450 --> 02:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
that I understand the question but I
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
will point out that this bill simply
 
02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:29.330 align:start position:0%
will point out that this bill simply
reverts

02:26:29.330 --> 02:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
reverts
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
um the method to adopt back to the
 
02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
original language that was in the
 
02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
statute when this bill was originally
 
02:26:38.399 --> 02:26:40.010 align:start position:0%
statute when this bill was originally
passed

02:26:40.010 --> 02:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
um to implement and outline the sb2
 
02:26:43.439 --> 02:26:45.950 align:start position:0%
um to implement and outline the sb2
system

02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.429 --> 02:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:51.410 --> 02:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:26:53.570 --> 02:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
um putting this on the ballot and the
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
way to do that certainly does take uh
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
some understanding I'm curious if you
 
02:27:03.650 --> 02:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
know are there communities that have
 
02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
expressed a a dire problem the way the
 
02:27:11.450 --> 02:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
law exists now or I mean have expressed
 
02:27:16.250 --> 02:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
a an extreme uh uh well I'll go back to
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
the word an extreme problem with the way
 
02:27:19.490 --> 02:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
the law exists
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Maggiore
 
02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a very good question so
 
02:27:26.809 --> 02:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
as I had stated
 
02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
um my background this bill comes from a
 
02:27:32.450 --> 02:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
request by a number of constituents so
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
yes to your point there there has been a
 
02:27:39.410 --> 02:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
repeat and experience problem with
 
02:27:42.010 --> 02:27:42.020 align:start position:0%
regard to the question to adopt sb2
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
being on the warrant to be acted upon at
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
the town meeting and that issue is that
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
this question
 
02:27:54.410 --> 02:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
never even gets to be debated because
 
02:27:58.010 --> 02:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
what is happening in in my constituents
 
02:28:01.130 --> 02:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
experience is that the question to adopt
 
02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
is being tabled by people
 
02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
um who are choosing to table it
 
02:28:11.809 --> 02:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
um and this has happened in the middle
 
02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
of a a an individual presenting
 
02:28:19.309 --> 02:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
the question to adopt right in the
 
02:28:21.889 --> 02:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
middle of his presentation somebody will
 
02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
jump up and make a motion
 
02:28:26.809 --> 02:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
um to table it a vote is taken and there
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
isn't even a discussion so that would be
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
02:28:32.929 --> 02:28:32.939 align:start position:0%
so by reverting
 
02:28:35.809 --> 02:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
to the original language
 
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
um that would be a solution to that um
 
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
to that problem
 
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh next we have uh
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
a some testimony from her yes
 
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
from a former member of the committee I
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
was kind of a
 
02:28:57.469 --> 02:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
celebrity of sorts in the House of
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh former representative
 
02:29:00.359 --> 02:29:03.050 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh former representative
Blanchard

02:29:03.050 --> 02:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
Blanchard
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
02:29:07.250 --> 02:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
I assume you can hear me yes you sound
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
fine right ahead
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh Good Day committee members my name is
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
Jim Belanger of Hollis New Hampshire and
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'm representing myself
 
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
I'm a former New Hampshire State Rep
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
serving on the municipal and County
 
02:29:24.650 --> 02:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
government committee for nine years
 
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since I sat with some
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
of you on this committee
 
02:29:31.250 --> 02:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
I must bring to your attention that this
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
committee has dealt with this very issue
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
as late as the year 2019 in House Bill
 
02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:38.389 align:start position:0%
as late as the year 2019 in House Bill
415

02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
415
 
02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
at that time we recognized that voting
 
02:29:44.450 --> 02:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
to adopt sb2 in a regular deliberative
 
02:29:47.090 --> 02:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
town meeting should be done according to
 
02:29:49.969 --> 02:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
the town meeting process as required of
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
all other warrant articles that is to be
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
deliberated and voted on by the same
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
voters who deliberated it
 
02:30:01.730 --> 02:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
the method that was currently in the
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
rsas was flawed in that it departed from
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
the traditional town meeting format and
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
used a format that is in place after the
 
02:30:13.130 --> 02:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
sb2 process is adopted
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
since that has not yet been adopted
 
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
why were the voters mandated to vote on
 
02:30:22.690 --> 02:30:22.700 align:start position:0%
a process which is only in place after
 
02:30:26.750 --> 02:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
sb2 format is in place and the article
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
gets a deliberative session followed by
 
02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
a second session where ballot voting
 
02:30:34.130 --> 02:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
takes place on the article by voters
 
02:30:37.130 --> 02:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
that were not at the deliberative
 
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
session to hear the arguments
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
this bill House Bill 374 reverses the
 
02:30:48.110 --> 02:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
effect of House Bill 415 of 2019
 
02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
sponsored by members of this very
 
02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:51.410 align:start position:0%
sponsored by members of this very
committee

02:30:51.410 --> 02:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
former chair Carson former chair
 
02:30:56.290 --> 02:30:56.300 align:start position:0%
Belanger former clerk Porter
 
02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore it is my opinion
 
02:31:02.270 --> 02:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion that promote
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
proponents of sb2 are attempting to
 
02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
introduce SP2 procedures and processes
 
02:31:12.889 --> 02:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
into a non-sb2 town meeting
 
02:31:15.650 --> 02:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
let's adopt the sb2 form of governance
 
02:31:18.530 --> 02:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
before forcing its processes on the
 
02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
community that has not chosen to use
 
02:31:22.370 --> 02:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
that format
 
02:31:26.270 --> 02:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
do we mandate sb2 communities to vote on
 
02:31:28.929 --> 02:31:28.939 align:start position:0%
articles especially to withdraw from sb2
 
02:31:31.010 --> 02:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
using the traditional town meeting
 
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
format and voting on it at the sb2
 
02:31:37.130 --> 02:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
delivery session of course not
 
02:31:39.349 --> 02:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
in closing I would remind the committee
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
that in 2019 House Bill 415 passed this
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee on a vote of 18 to 1. pass the
 
02:31:50.090 --> 02:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
house even after being withdrawn from
 
02:31:51.650 --> 02:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar
 
02:31:54.770 --> 02:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate on a Voice vote and
 
02:31:56.210 --> 02:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
was signed by the governor in August
 
02:31:56.220 --> 02:31:58.309 align:start position:0%
was signed by the governor in August
2019.

02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
2019.

02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:25.560 align:start position:0%

please state where you're from and uh
 
02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
what your feelings are about the bill
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
okay my name is Laura Bono I'm the Town
 
02:32:40.210 --> 02:32:40.220 align:start position:0%
Administrator for the town of Hillsboro
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
and I am opposed to this bill
 
02:32:46.370 --> 02:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
much as represent past representative
 
02:32:49.130 --> 02:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
Belanger stated I testified a couple
 
02:32:52.490 --> 02:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
years ago on House Bill 415 and at that
 
02:32:54.650 --> 02:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
time the legislature understood the area
 
02:32:58.250 --> 02:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
within the RSA which required adopting
 
02:33:00.349 --> 02:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
the official ballot referendum form of
 
02:33:02.929 --> 02:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
meeting to be placed on the official
 
02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
ballot versus at town meeting
 
02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
um when a community is asked to vote on
 
02:33:11.630 --> 02:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
changing their legislative process from
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
town meeting to Senate bill to it's a
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
significant change which warrants this
 
02:33:18.050 --> 02:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
to discussion
 
02:33:20.330 --> 02:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately the
 
02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
public hearings that representative
 
02:33:25.389 --> 02:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
power mentioned are not well attended
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
similar to The deliberative Sessions in
 
02:33:29.809 --> 02:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 2 communities are not well
 
02:33:32.270 --> 02:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
attended so the information is not
 
02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
getting out
 
02:33:37.070 --> 02:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
whether the request is being brought
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
forward by a petitioner which has been
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
my experience in my career or by the
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen the voters should
 
02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
hear the reasoning as to the request as
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
well as have the ability to ask
 
02:33:51.469 --> 02:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
questions and seek further information
 
02:33:52.969 --> 02:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't be treated any
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
differently than any other major changes
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
such as imposing a tax cap or even the
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
establishment of a budget committee for
 
02:34:02.330 --> 02:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
example both of which are done as a
 
02:34:04.969 --> 02:34:04.979 align:start position:0%
warrant article a town meeting
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to repeat a little bit of what
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger stated because
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
at the time the Warren article is
 
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
presented you are a town meeting form of
 
02:34:16.730 --> 02:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
government so that is where it should be
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
voted on and discussed
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
you know it's only been that change has
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
only been in place since 2019 so I don't
 
02:34:30.110 --> 02:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
know where the established history of it
 
02:34:32.870 --> 02:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
not working comes from it didn't seem to
 
02:34:35.389 --> 02:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
work prior to changing it or correcting
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
it to how it should be
 
02:34:40.490 --> 02:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
um but leaving it as is and requiring it
 
02:34:42.730 --> 02:34:42.740 align:start position:0%
to be brought to town meeting
 
02:34:47.809 --> 02:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
will enable the people who vote on it to
 
02:34:50.210 --> 02:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
have the questions answered have a good
 
02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
understanding and cast their
 
02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
confidential though because it's
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
required to have a paper ballot and
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
they'll be doing that in confidence if
 
02:35:00.410 --> 02:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
they don't understand the question on
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
the ballot they're going to either vote
 
02:35:05.210 --> 02:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
no or not vote at all so that doesn't
 
02:35:07.389 --> 02:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
accomplish anything
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
more than
 
02:35:12.110 --> 02:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
showing that people are not going to
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
vote on something if they don't
 
02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for allowing me to
 
02:35:19.969 --> 02:35:19.979 align:start position:0%
testify and
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
um for your time and consideration thank
 
02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:31.210 --> 02:35:31.220 align:start position:0%
seeing that I'm going to move on to nhma
 
02:35:35.690 --> 02:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh again Cordell
 
02:35:40.010 --> 02:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
Johnston representing the New Hampshire
 
02:35:42.770 --> 02:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and we are opposed
 
02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
02:35:47.210 --> 02:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
um as as former representative former
 
02:35:49.730 --> 02:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
chairman Belanger said
 
02:35:55.070 --> 02:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
um the Old Law that was 19 the Old Law
 
02:35:58.610 --> 02:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
never really made sense uh because it
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
had the legislative body making a
 
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
decision in a manner that that it
 
02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't do
 
02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
um the understand the town meeting is a
 
02:36:11.050 --> 02:36:11.060 align:start position:0%
legislative body as the New Hampshire
 
02:36:13.490 --> 02:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
legislature the House of Representatives
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
as a representative is a legislative
 
02:36:21.530 --> 02:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
body uh as such they assemble the debate
 
02:36:23.630 --> 02:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
and discuss matters and then they vote
 
02:36:25.490 --> 02:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
on them they don't just come into the
 
02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
local news and vote on them by
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
um uh by uh secret ballot
 
02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
and in order to make an informed
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
decision they need to have that
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
discussion and understand what they're
 
02:36:39.410 --> 02:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
what they're voting on
 
02:36:42.889 --> 02:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
as I think it was Laura Bono said uh yes
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
there is a hearing uh under the Old Law
 
02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
yes there was a hearing before the
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
matter went to the official ballot but
 
02:36:53.809 --> 02:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
almost nobody goes to that hearing in my
 
02:36:55.730 --> 02:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
town we've considered
 
02:36:59.270 --> 02:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
um adopting sb2 six or seven times
 
02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
um I've gone to most of those hearings
 
02:37:04.610 --> 02:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
and uh there have never been more than
 
02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
10 people at the hearings so people
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
don't don't learn about it they don't
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
understand it and I can say the first
 
02:37:14.929 --> 02:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
time that the issue was on the ballot uh
 
02:37:17.570 --> 02:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
in my town and this was before I changed
 
02:37:19.550 --> 02:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
careers and became a municipal lawyer
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't I I didn't have any idea
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
what this was about I went into the
 
02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
voting booth I consider myself a pretty
 
02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
well-informed voter but there was that
 
02:37:29.389 --> 02:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
question and I thought I have no idea
 
02:37:32.450 --> 02:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
what this means so I voted no
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh as Laura Bono said that's what
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
people are going to do they're they're
 
02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
not a vote base based just sort of on a
 
02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:41.510 align:start position:0%
not a vote base based just sort of on a
guess

02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about changing the
 
02:37:44.929 --> 02:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
form of your town meeting you should not
 
02:37:47.809 --> 02:37:47.819 align:start position:0%
be doing that yet based on a guess about
 
02:37:50.570 --> 02:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
what it means you could have a serious
 
02:37:53.330 --> 02:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
discussion and debate
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
and uh and vote based on uh based on
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
that discussion and debate just as the
 
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives does
 
02:38:04.849 --> 02:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
um I'll end there and if anyone has any
 
02:38:07.610 --> 02:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
questions I would be very happy to try
 
02:38:09.230 --> 02:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
to answer them thank you
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
seeing that night I do have one question
 
02:38:19.490 --> 02:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair we'll be right ahead thank you
 
02:38:21.170 --> 02:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that and thank you Cordell
 
02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:38:26.929 --> 02:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
um HB 415 I don't expect you to remember
 
02:38:28.610 --> 02:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
it by number but it's the bill we're
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
discussing from 2019 which was the last
 
02:38:33.530 --> 02:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
change to this which I think cleared it
 
02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:34.790 align:start position:0%
change to this which I think cleared it
up

02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:35.389 align:start position:0%
up
um

02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
did the sponsors work with nhma to to
 
02:38:41.750 --> 02:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
craft that language that was ultimately
 
02:38:44.090 --> 02:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
signed into law
 
02:38:46.969 --> 02:38:46.979 align:start position:0%
I remember yes they did I'm a little
 
02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
insulted that you thought I wouldn't
 
02:38:53.570 --> 02:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
all right I'll take my lumps on that one
 
02:38:59.570 --> 02:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
but yes we did we did work with uh the
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh sponsors from both parties just to be
 
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
clear uh on that legislation
 
02:39:08.330 --> 02:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
02:39:14.809 --> 02:39:14.819 align:start position:0%
from uh Attorney Johnson
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
being done uh I believe we have a member
 
02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
of the public that would like to speak
 
02:39:22.610 --> 02:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
in our position Bill Gail Cromwell
 
02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
is she on the line
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes I am here can you hear me yes it
 
02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:30.889 align:start position:0%
yes I am here can you hear me yes it
sounds

02:39:30.889 --> 02:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
02:39:34.250 --> 02:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
um my name is Gail Cromwell
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
my town of Temple has had 15 years worth
 
02:39:41.870 --> 02:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
of experience with sb2 on the official
 
02:39:45.050 --> 02:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
ballot it has rarely come close to
 
02:39:47.809 --> 02:39:47.819 align:start position:0%
actually being adopted but the sponsor
 
02:39:50.990 --> 02:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
does not accept failure he keeps going
 
02:39:52.730 --> 02:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
however what I would like to say is
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
probably more important which is that
 
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
sb2 is one of the most important
 
02:40:03.889 --> 02:40:03.899 align:start position:0%
decisions that a town can make and I
 
02:40:06.650 --> 02:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
would have to tell you that 162 towns
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
still have traditional town meeting only
 
02:40:13.610 --> 02:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
70 towns have adopted sb2 and they tend
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
to be the larger towns
 
02:40:19.370 --> 02:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
in a the question I think that is really
 
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
important is what is the best place to
 
02:40:26.809 --> 02:40:26.819 align:start position:0%
actually discuss whether a town is going
 
02:40:30.050 --> 02:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
to adopt sb2 or not I was a selectman
 
02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
for six years I ran a number of those
 
02:40:35.450 --> 02:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
hearings that were required I will tell
 
02:40:38.330 --> 02:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
you no one goes to those hearings
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
the most common place where sb2 is
 
02:40:46.370 --> 02:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
debated and discussed is on Facebook now
 
02:40:48.889 --> 02:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
I don't know how experienced you all are
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
with Facebook
 
02:40:53.389 --> 02:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
but it is not a source for accurate
 
02:40:53.399 --> 02:40:54.889 align:start position:0%
but it is not a source for accurate
information

02:40:54.889 --> 02:40:54.899 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
in our case it became very abusive to
 
02:40:58.560 --> 02:40:59.690 align:start position:0%
in our case it became very abusive to
people

02:40:59.690 --> 02:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
three points it became downright ugly
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
there was no way for anyone to make a
 
02:41:08.330 --> 02:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
statement that we should not or should
 
02:41:11.809 --> 02:41:11.819 align:start position:0%
adopt sv2 in any rational way
 
02:41:14.510 --> 02:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
so the conclusion that I have been very
 
02:41:17.450 --> 02:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
glad to be happy with was the adoption
 
02:41:21.170 --> 02:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
in 2019 of the present situation
 
02:41:23.389 --> 02:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
we're still required to have a hearing
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
one of the early proponents of this
 
02:41:28.670 --> 02:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
legislation said that you would only go
 
02:41:31.610 --> 02:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
to town meeting that's not true the
 
02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
current legislation says you still have
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
to have a hearing and we have scheduled
 
02:41:38.690 --> 02:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
a hearing for this year before town
 
02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
meeting then at town meeting we hope
 
02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
that we can actually discuss the merits
 
02:41:49.250 --> 02:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
of sb2 or the demerits of it in a
 
02:41:51.650 --> 02:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
rational way I think that is what we all
 
02:41:54.349 --> 02:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
hope for is to be able to have some sort
 
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
of rational discussion so that people
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
actually understand what they are doing
 
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
because when in the previous situation
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
people did not know what they were doing
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate your time in taking up
 
02:42:11.150 --> 02:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
this and I do hope that you will vote
 
02:42:12.770 --> 02:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
against this Bill thank you very much
 
02:42:15.010 --> 02:42:15.020 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to answer any questions
 
02:42:17.450 --> 02:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Cromwell are there any
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
seeing that other uh
 
02:42:27.530 --> 02:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative man jewelry or could you
 
02:42:29.330 --> 02:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
tell from your screen if there are other
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
members of the public that wish to
 
02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:31.910 align:start position:0%
members of the public that wish to
testify

02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
I do see Mr chair yes I do see one hand
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
up from Eric power
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
Mr power uh please uh go ahead and offer
 
02:42:43.130 --> 02:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
you a testimony
 
02:42:45.170 --> 02:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
well Mr chairman this is uh Eric power
 
02:42:48.110 --> 02:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
resident of Brookline and I'm speaking
 
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
in support of house bill 374.
 
02:42:53.389 --> 02:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh as a little bit of background uh
 
02:42:57.170 --> 02:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
Brookline adopted the SP2 system in 2016
 
02:42:58.910 --> 02:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
for our school district
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
and we're a town of 5300 and we've been
 
02:43:03.410 --> 02:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
very happy with it
 
02:43:04.730 --> 02:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:43:06.410 --> 02:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's the reason I'm speaking in favor
 
02:43:08.690 --> 02:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
of this here one reason
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
um until the 2019 change the question of
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
adopting SP sb2 ballot was placed on the
 
02:43:16.010 --> 02:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
official ballot to be voted on during
 
02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
town and school election day with the
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
change the adoption question now is
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
placed on the town or School District
 
02:43:24.050 --> 02:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
warrant for Action during the
 
02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting
 
02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
this change makes it virtually
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
impossible for a town or School District
 
02:43:32.210 --> 02:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
to adopt sb2 and let me explain why to
 
02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
illustrate this point I will use the
 
02:43:34.730 --> 02:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
example of our Hollis Brooklyn
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District which
 
02:43:37.610 --> 02:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
includes the towns of Hollis and
 
02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:38.809 align:start position:0%
includes the towns of Hollis and
Brookline

02:43:38.809 --> 02:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
Brookline
 
02:43:41.330 --> 02:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
when the sb2 question is proposed as it
 
02:43:43.250 --> 02:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
is this year again there are many
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
mandatory hearings that must be
 
02:43:48.889 --> 02:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
conducted in fact RSA 4014 requires two
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
sb2 adoption hearings to be widely
 
02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
announced with a hearing in each town
 
02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
and on different days
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
in addition the school board deliberates
 
02:44:00.770 --> 02:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
and takes a position on sb2 adoption at
 
02:44:02.929 --> 02:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
the required budget hearing
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
in addition all these meetings are live
 
02:44:06.650 --> 02:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
streamed and recorded and the minutes
 
02:44:08.809 --> 02:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
are available too I'll give you the
 
02:44:10.969 --> 02:44:10.979 align:start position:0%
experience from this year when we went
 
02:44:13.309 --> 02:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
to zoom we had over 100 people attending
 
02:44:16.010 --> 02:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
both nights of the hearing that involved
 
02:44:18.050 --> 02:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
discussions on sb2 so I would say that's
 
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
not a small number
 
02:44:22.370 --> 02:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
so there there are a lot many
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities for students to get
 
02:44:26.809 --> 02:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
informed and debate sb2
 
02:44:29.450 --> 02:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
with the 2019 change the sb2 adoption
 
02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
question is supposed to be deliberated
 
02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
yet again at the Traditional School
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
District meeting
 
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
or town meeting before before a
 
02:44:39.770 --> 02:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
potential vote I use the word supposed
 
02:44:42.170 --> 02:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
to and potential because voters cannot
 
02:44:43.969 --> 02:44:43.979 align:start position:0%
be certain that the sb2 adoption
 
02:44:46.190 --> 02:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
question will even be debated upon or
 
02:44:47.690 --> 02:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
voted upon
 
02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
in the past as a petitioner I have
 
02:44:51.469 --> 02:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
coordinated Advance with the school
 
02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
district moderator to present
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
information on citizen petition worn
 
02:44:56.929 --> 02:44:56.939 align:start position:0%
articles including such topics as tax
 
02:44:59.870 --> 02:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
cap or requiring tax impact notation on
 
02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
Warren articles at the meeting after the
 
02:45:04.849 --> 02:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
warrant was properly moved and seconded
 
02:45:06.889 --> 02:45:06.899 align:start position:0%
I have begun my presentation to the
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
meeting only to be interrupted by an
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
aggressive voter with a point of order
 
02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
with a motion to table the article the
 
02:45:15.410 --> 02:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
moderator then calls a card vote to
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
table by simple majority vote and the
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
article is table with no further
 
02:45:22.370 --> 02:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
discussion debate and no vote
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this pattern has happened
 
02:45:26.929 --> 02:45:26.939 align:start position:0%
many times over the years
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
the Hollis Brookline Cooperative school
 
02:45:29.870 --> 02:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
district meetings have always been long
 
02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
and sometimes have had multiple sessions
 
02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
over the dates over many dates and I
 
02:45:36.830 --> 02:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
have I sent you a written testimony but
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
we've had sessions that have been one
 
02:45:40.370 --> 02:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
two three and even five sessions long we
 
02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
had a session in 2018 that lasted 14
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
hours of meetings
 
02:45:46.250 --> 02:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
so you can see it's not a short meeting
 
02:45:46.260 --> 02:45:48.050 align:start position:0%
so you can see it's not a short meeting
generally

02:45:48.050 --> 02:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
generally
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
practically speaking only a small number
 
02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
of citizens are willing and able to
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
endure these long multi-night meetings
 
02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
and these voters are overwhelmingly
 
02:45:57.410 --> 02:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
against adopting sb2 because they prefer
 
02:45:59.330 --> 02:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
to maintain the control of the
 
02:46:00.530 --> 02:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting
 
02:46:02.090 --> 02:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
it's not reasonable to expect many
 
02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
voters in favor of sb2 to attend the
 
02:46:05.270 --> 02:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting in hopes of
 
02:46:07.010 --> 02:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
potentially discussing and getting an
 
02:46:09.530 --> 02:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote on sb2
 
02:46:13.370 --> 02:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the 2019 changed said
 
02:46:15.230 --> 02:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
that the question of adopting SP2 is so
 
02:46:16.370 --> 02:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
important that it needs to require
 
02:46:18.290 --> 02:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
voters to be educated again at the
 
02:46:19.849 --> 02:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting debated and then
 
02:46:21.770 --> 02:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
voted upon then and there
 
02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
this is Fault this is a faulty argument
 
02:46:25.550 --> 02:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
for several reasons there are already
 
02:46:28.010 --> 02:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions and opportunities to
 
02:46:29.450 --> 02:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
learn and debate the pros and cons of
 
02:46:32.030 --> 02:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
SP2 with long and often multi-night
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
meetings voters have no idea when the
 
02:46:35.929 --> 02:46:35.939 align:start position:0%
SP2 question will potentially be brought
 
02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
to the floor
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
lastly there is certainly no guarantee
 
02:46:41.929 --> 02:46:41.939 align:start position:0%
that a debate or even a vote on adopting
 
02:46:45.170 --> 02:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
sb2 will occur at a traditional meeting
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
in fact the situation recently happened
 
02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
last year Hollow citizens placed the sb2
 
02:46:55.309 --> 02:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
adoption question on their 2020 Town
 
02:46:56.990 --> 02:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
warrant via petition
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
during their traditional town meeting
 
02:47:02.990 --> 02:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
the sb2 adoption question was tabled it
 
02:47:04.670 --> 02:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
was tabled without a vote or even a
 
02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:05.929 align:start position:0%
was tabled without a vote or even a
debate

02:47:05.929 --> 02:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
debate
 
02:47:09.050 --> 02:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
did this 2019 change improve the process
 
02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
clearly no debate and no vote on sb2
 
02:47:14.090 --> 02:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
adoption is not an improvement
 
02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
ironically Hollis is the hometown of the
 
02:47:18.410 --> 02:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor of the 2019 change which
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
moved the adoption question to the often
 
02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
official ballot
 
02:47:24.349 --> 02:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
thus the effect of the current law is to
 
02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
prevent the adoption of sb2 returning
 
02:47:28.910 --> 02:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
the sb2 adoption question to the
 
02:47:30.410 --> 02:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
official ballot is reasonable and
 
02:47:32.570 --> 02:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
logical it guarantees that the question
 
02:47:34.610 --> 02:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
will get a vote there are ample
 
02:47:36.650 --> 02:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
opportunities to learn about SP2 and get
 
02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:37.790 align:start position:0%
opportunities to learn about SP2 and get
informed

02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
informed
 
02:47:40.730 --> 02:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
more importantly HP 374 enables all
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
voters to weigh on in this weigh in on
 
02:47:44.450 --> 02:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
this important question at The Ballot
 
02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
Box on Town election day or by absentee
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
ballot when more voters participate the
 
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
outcome better reflects the will of the
 
02:47:53.929 --> 02:47:53.939 align:start position:0%
community I urge committee members to
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
vote Auto pass on House Bill 374. thank
 
02:47:58.730 --> 02:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:48:01.250 --> 02:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you heather questions uh yes uh
 
02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
02:48:05.929 --> 02:48:05.939 align:start position:0%
yes I think there's there's one thing we
 
02:48:09.050 --> 02:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
can all agree on we have experience with
 
02:48:09.060 --> 02:48:10.330 align:start position:0%
can all agree on we have experience with
sb2

02:48:10.330 --> 02:48:10.340 align:start position:0%
sb2
 
02:48:14.330 --> 02:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh that the participation of the
 
02:48:18.590 --> 02:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
community in the deliberative session is
 
02:48:21.650 --> 02:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
generally very light
 
02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:23.030 align:start position:0%
generally very light
and

02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's been my experience that it's very
 
02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
easy for a a group of people who have a
 
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
particular interest in one of the
 
02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
questions that's going to come up to
 
02:48:42.290 --> 02:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
pack the meeting and then cause the
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
outcome of the beating to be what their
 
02:48:49.309 --> 02:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
particular feeling is and there are
 
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of people who are opposed
 
02:48:57.610 --> 02:48:57.620 align:start position:0%
to the whole idea of sb2
 
02:49:00.010 --> 02:49:00.020 align:start position:0%
by allowing
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
the people as a whole to vote
 
02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
on the official ballot of sb2 seems like
 
02:49:14.809 --> 02:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
a very uh much more democratic way of
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
solving that SP2 question and in fact to
 
02:49:23.150 --> 02:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
me it's the whole purpose of that it was
 
02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier about access to the
 
02:49:29.570 --> 02:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
official ballot and being able to
 
02:49:32.330 --> 02:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
participate by people who are
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
handicapped and uh
 
02:49:39.950 --> 02:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh and it's been my experience and I
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm uh directing this at
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
isn't it your experience that that
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
handicapped people are more
 
02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
able to participate in an sb2 question
 
02:49:59.630 --> 02:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
on the official ballot then going to a
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
deliberative session
 
02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:50:06.170 --> 02:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
um yes it is my opinion that
 
02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:10.250 align:start position:0%
um yes it is my opinion that
um

02:50:10.250 --> 02:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:12.770 --> 02:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
people who
 
02:50:15.410 --> 02:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
um have difficulty getting to a
 
02:50:17.510 --> 02:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting and
 
02:50:21.290 --> 02:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
tending very long traditional meetings
 
02:50:25.370 --> 02:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
um it is much more accessible for them
 
02:50:29.330 --> 02:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
to participate in the the the town
 
02:50:33.290 --> 02:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
um as a member of the legislative body
 
02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
um to be able to uh
 
02:50:39.889 --> 02:50:39.899 align:start position:0%
cast their votes on the official ballot
 
02:50:44.809 --> 02:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:48.230 --> 02:50:48.240 align:start position:0%

deliberative session or a traditional

uh that's a campaign
um

02:51:31.150 --> 02:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
Administration kind of thing so what
 
02:51:37.370 --> 02:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
makes that different from having a town
 
02:51:40.429 --> 02:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
having an sb2 town I mean
 
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
can't somebody pack uh the voting booths
 
02:51:50.030 --> 02:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
the question yes I think the the uh what
 
02:51:56.030 --> 02:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
happens at a sb2 deliberative session
 
02:51:57.530 --> 02:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
what's happening at attritional
 
02:51:59.990 --> 02:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
um who goes to the meeting and who
 
02:52:03.650 --> 02:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
participates is vitally important the
 
02:52:05.150 --> 02:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
deliberative session is deciding the
 
02:52:07.610 --> 02:52:07.620 align:start position:0%
form and what's on the warrant in the
 
02:52:09.530 --> 02:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting is debating both the
 
02:52:11.870 --> 02:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
warrant and taking action
 
02:52:13.849 --> 02:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important who goes so
 
02:52:15.170 --> 02:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
people that think that the liberative
 
02:52:17.570 --> 02:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
session isn't important I think uh don't
 
02:52:19.250 --> 02:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
understand it completely
 
02:52:22.969 --> 02:52:22.979 align:start position:0%
but the the the point is is that through
 
02:52:25.130 --> 02:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions generally are
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
conducted in a few hours
 
02:52:32.330 --> 02:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
not multiple days multiple nights
 
02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it's much easier to participate
 
02:52:37.790 --> 02:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
in that way
 
02:52:40.429 --> 02:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
also the sb2 question
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
is trying to enfranchise many voters who
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
cannot make these meetings
 
02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
and they cannot go to the meeting to say
 
02:52:48.889 --> 02:52:48.899 align:start position:0%
they don't want to go to the meeting
 
02:52:51.050 --> 02:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
that's the problem here so you
 
02:52:54.530 --> 02:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
enfranchise the the voters to be able to
 
02:52:57.410 --> 02:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
adopt sb2 many of which who can never
 
02:52:59.450 --> 02:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
make a traditional meeting
 
02:53:01.969 --> 02:53:01.979 align:start position:0%
so I think by enfranchising everybody to
 
02:53:04.250 --> 02:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
decide in providing all the app
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are out there to
 
02:53:09.950 --> 02:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
learn about sb2 it's uh I think that it
 
02:53:11.990 --> 02:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
is a fair system to be able to put it on
 
02:53:13.910 --> 02:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
the official ballot and by the way the
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
official ballots also used for zoning
 
02:53:17.210 --> 02:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
questions and we don't require people to
 
02:53:19.130 --> 02:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
go to zoning board meetings to vote on
 
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
that as well people vote on it based on
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
how they educate themselves just like
 
02:53:25.849 --> 02:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
they would on sb2 thank you
 
02:53:28.670 --> 02:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Porter
 
02:53:31.130 --> 02:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and this question is
 
02:53:35.630 --> 02:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
for Mr power I'm so in my town we have
 
02:53:37.849 --> 02:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting in my school
 
02:53:40.610 --> 02:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
district is sb2 so I have experience
 
02:53:43.130 --> 02:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
with both deliberative sessions and town
 
02:53:43.140 --> 02:53:45.349 align:start position:0%
with both deliberative sessions and town
meetings

02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:53:47.690 --> 02:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
my experience has been that people
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
attend town meeting at a higher number
 
02:53:54.110 --> 02:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
and participate more than they do at
 
02:53:56.030 --> 02:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
just like with you and with us as
 
02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives it's our responsibility
 
02:54:06.349 --> 02:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
before we vote on a bill to listen to
 
02:54:06.359 --> 02:54:07.670 align:start position:0%
before we vote on a bill to listen to
testimony

02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
ask questions and Ponder and make what
 
02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
we consider the best decision for the
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire in a similar way
 
02:54:18.290 --> 02:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
people need to do that
 
02:54:21.410 --> 02:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:23.929 --> 02:54:23.939 align:start position:0%
getting people to the meetings is an
 
02:54:27.050 --> 02:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.450 --> 02:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
systems as you have explained it's it's
 
02:54:35.150 --> 02:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
so my question is isn't it the
 
02:54:37.490 --> 02:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the people in the
 
02:54:39.050 --> 02:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
community to attend
 
02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
town meeting if this is going to be on
 
02:54:44.330 --> 02:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
the ballot or deliberative sessions
 
02:54:46.790 --> 02:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
prior to putting the questions on the
 
02:54:49.730 --> 02:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
ballot is not is that responsibility on
 
02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:56.990 --> 02:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
or is it up to us to find a way that
 
02:54:59.150 --> 02:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
they can avoid doing it and still have
 
02:55:01.849 --> 02:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
well I uh thank you for the question so
 
02:55:07.969 --> 02:55:07.979 align:start position:0%
there's the the question of adopting sb2
 
02:55:09.950 --> 02:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
is a challenging one because
 
02:55:11.690 --> 02:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
you know there's many people that can
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
simply not make a traditional meeting
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I and you've heard some of the
 
02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
people that cannot do that
 
02:55:19.010 --> 02:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
um but they would very much want to
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
participate in this in the uh in the
 
02:55:25.250 --> 02:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
Democracy we have the sb2 system
 
02:55:27.230 --> 02:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
provides that so I don't want to get too
 
02:55:28.910 --> 02:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
much into the details of the pros and
 
02:55:31.550 --> 02:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
cons of sb2 but you know you have SP2
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
you have two opportunities to
 
02:55:34.730 --> 02:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
participate the deliberative session in
 
02:55:37.070 --> 02:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
the balloting session and undoubtedly
 
02:55:39.889 --> 02:55:39.899 align:start position:0%
the balloting session always has the
 
02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
largest number of participants because
 
02:55:43.370 --> 02:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
people are voting on Election Day or by
 
02:55:44.690 --> 02:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and that's been our
 
02:55:44.700 --> 02:55:45.769 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and that's been our
experience

02:55:45.769 --> 02:55:45.779 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:55:48.410 --> 02:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
like uh Hillsborough and Brookline we do
 
02:55:50.929 --> 02:55:50.939 align:start position:0%
have the SP2 system for our school and
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
we have the traditional town meeting for
 
02:55:54.530 --> 02:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
our town
 
02:55:56.269 --> 02:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
and so we have that we have that
 
02:55:59.450 --> 02:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
experience and I'd say if you look at
 
02:56:00.889 --> 02:56:00.899 align:start position:0%
our numbers and I've looked to talk to
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
our town clerk our deliberative sessions
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
that we've had for our school have had
 
02:56:07.490 --> 02:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
the same or even a little higher than
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
our traditional meetings for our school
 
02:56:12.650 --> 02:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
so we have not seen that uh drop off
 
02:56:14.690 --> 02:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
we've had very much the same amount of
 
02:56:15.889 --> 02:56:15.899 align:start position:0%
interest in our school district
 
02:56:17.630 --> 02:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions as we did in our
 
02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:18.590 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions as we did in our
traditional

02:56:18.590 --> 02:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
02:56:21.469 --> 02:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh meetings but I think it getting back
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
to your question the
 
02:56:25.610 --> 02:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
um it is the responsibility of of
 
02:56:28.610 --> 02:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
everyone to to participate but like I
 
02:56:32.090 --> 02:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
say people cannot always go to the town
 
02:56:32.100 --> 02:56:33.290 align:start position:0%
say people cannot always go to the town
meeting

02:56:33.290 --> 02:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
whether or School District meeting to
 
02:56:38.170 --> 02:56:38.180 align:start position:0%
vote to adopt sb2 and unfortunately
 
02:56:40.670 --> 02:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee you even have a
 
02:56:43.849 --> 02:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
vote or when the vote occurs and that
 
02:56:45.889 --> 02:56:45.899 align:start position:0%
that has already happened in Hollis in
 
02:56:47.809 --> 02:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
our neighboring town of talking to my
 
02:56:49.610 --> 02:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
friends in Hollis they have told me that
 
02:56:51.469 --> 02:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
they were very frustrated by the they
 
02:56:53.330 --> 02:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
waited at the meeting to vote and then
 
02:56:54.590 --> 02:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't even get to vote on it
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
because it was tabled it wasn't even
 
02:56:59.150 --> 02:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
debated so that doesn't that doesn't
 
02:57:01.250 --> 02:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
seem to be an improvement and I and I
 
02:57:02.510 --> 02:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
think that that's probably where we're
 
02:57:04.250 --> 02:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
heading this year for our Co-op meeting
 
02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
where we're we've debated sb2
 
02:57:09.050 --> 02:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
four times already this year and now
 
02:57:10.250 --> 02:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to debate it again at the
 
02:57:13.010 --> 02:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
meeting so I think it makes a lot of
 
02:57:15.769 --> 02:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
sense to put it on the official ballot
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
so that you do get you have the debate
 
02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
but you also have a vote and I think
 
02:57:21.110 --> 02:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
that that's important that people that
 
02:57:22.370 --> 02:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
you just like in the House of
 
02:57:23.870 --> 02:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives everything gets a vote
 
02:57:28.190 --> 02:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:29.870 --> 02:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
02:57:32.690 --> 02:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
power for taking my question which you
 
02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I think you answered a little bit
 
02:57:37.550 --> 02:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
with your last statement but since this
 
02:57:40.309 --> 02:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
bill since 415 went into effect there's
 
02:57:42.830 --> 02:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
been one local Town election I believe
 
02:57:45.230 --> 02:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
which was in 2020.
 
02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
um not I'm not discounting any any
 
02:57:48.950 --> 02:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
issues that may be happening in Hollis
 
02:57:50.809 --> 02:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
or Brookline do you have any evidence
 
02:57:54.769 --> 02:57:54.779 align:start position:0%
though of other communities where during
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
the time where 415 has been an effect
 
02:58:00.130 --> 02:58:00.140 align:start position:0%
that there have been any issues or any
 
02:58:03.830 --> 02:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:08.510 --> 02:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
the um the the 2020 meeting for the
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
co-op did get a vote on sb2 and that's
 
02:58:13.849 --> 02:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
the only reason it happened for sure was
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
because we did we have a traditional
 
02:58:17.150 --> 02:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
meeting but we had the drive-through
 
02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:18.349 align:start position:0%
meeting but we had the drive-through
voting

02:58:18.349 --> 02:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:58:20.929 --> 02:58:20.939 align:start position:0%
there but it was it would be likely not
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
voted upon in my opinion we'll see what
 
02:58:24.769 --> 02:58:24.779 align:start position:0%
happens this year
 
02:58:27.889 --> 02:58:27.899 align:start position:0%
um I do have uh one one person I spoke
 
02:58:30.590 --> 02:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
to that's in Bow that they wish that
 
02:58:32.450 --> 02:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
they would have they're trying their
 
02:58:35.090 --> 02:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
have SP2 on the ballot this year and
 
02:58:37.309 --> 02:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
they want to uh they wished it was on
 
02:58:39.769 --> 02:58:39.779 align:start position:0%
the uh official ballot it's on their
 
02:58:42.170 --> 02:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
their warrant this year
 
02:58:44.030 --> 02:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
um but there's like I said it's only
 
02:58:45.469 --> 02:58:45.479 align:start position:0%
been in effect for this is the second
 
02:58:47.090 --> 02:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
year of it and last year was a little
 
02:58:48.530 --> 02:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
interesting in terms of all the town
 
02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
meetings so it was kind of hard to judge
 
02:58:50.880 --> 02:58:52.309 align:start position:0%
meetings so it was kind of hard to judge
but

02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:58:54.349 --> 02:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
um I think right now you're never going
 
02:58:57.710 --> 02:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
to see another town adopt sb2 until it
 
02:58:59.690 --> 02:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
gets be gets put back on the official
 
02:59:01.670 --> 02:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
ballot for all the reasons I stated in
 
02:59:04.550 --> 02:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
terms of the town meeting attendance
 
02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:59:09.530 --> 02:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I don't see any additional
 
02:59:11.630 --> 02:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions uh do we have
 
02:59:13.969 --> 02:59:13.979 align:start position:0%
any additional comments or testimony
 
02:59:16.429 --> 02:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
from the public
 
02:59:19.130 --> 02:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
it's like we do not I do not see any Mr
 
02:59:20.929 --> 02:59:20.939 align:start position:0%
chair all right I'm going to close the
 
02:59:22.969 --> 02:59:22.979 align:start position:0%
here uh before I close the hearing I
 
02:59:25.309 --> 02:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
just want to report on the sign-in sheet
 
02:59:28.250 --> 02:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
we had 24 people sign in one in support
 
02:59:31.130 --> 02:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
23 to pose and zero neutral
 
02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
and uh so with that I'm going to close
 
02:59:37.790 --> 02:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 374.
 
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh as a point of uh Administration as
 
02:59:43.730 --> 02:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
you look at the clock right now it's a
 
02:59:45.950 --> 02:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
little past 11 30. we're going to take a
 
02:59:50.530 --> 02:59:50.540 align:start position:0%
break for a half hour at 12 30 for lunch
 
02:59:53.389 --> 02:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
I anticipate that we'll probably still
 
02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
be in the hearing mode at that point so
 
02:59:57.230 --> 02:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
we'll recess whatever hearing we're in
 
03:00:01.490 --> 03:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
and then go to lunch at that point
 
03:00:03.710 --> 03:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
the next bill before us it's House Bill
 
03:00:03.720 --> 03:00:05.809 align:start position:0%
the next bill before us it's House Bill
341

03:00:05.809 --> 03:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
341
 
03:00:09.490 --> 03:00:09.500 align:start position:0%
and this is relative to permissible
 
03:00:12.769 --> 03:00:12.779 align:start position:0%
residential units in a residential Zone
 
03:00:15.590 --> 03:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
on the sign-in sheet we had 66 in
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:24.769 --> 03:00:24.779 align:start position:0%
and uh representative van as a as a a
 
03:00:26.510 --> 03:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor would you like to introduce the
 
03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:29.030 align:start position:0%
sponsor would you like to introduce the
bill

03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman I would like to
 
03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:36.429 --> 03:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
03:00:41.809 --> 03:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
okay uh House Bill 341 is a bill that
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
seeks to address a problem that we are
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
seeing all across the state of New
 
03:00:50.389 --> 03:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we are in a housing crisis
 
03:00:52.370 --> 03:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone denies that
 
03:00:54.650 --> 03:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
according to the latest numbers from the
 
03:00:56.389 --> 03:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
03:01:02.330 --> 03:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:04.910 --> 03:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and the problem is that
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
one of the problems that we're facing is
 
03:01:10.730 --> 03:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
that our existing housing stock doesn't
 
03:01:14.450 --> 03:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
match very well with who needs to live
 
03:01:19.130 --> 03:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
in it right now about 75 of all
 
03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
households are either single people
 
03:01:25.910 --> 03:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
couples or two unrelated people living
 
03:01:29.150 --> 03:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
together right now in New Hampshire a
 
03:01:31.870 --> 03:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
lot of our housing stock is big houses
 
03:01:34.910 --> 03:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
that do not work very well for the
 
03:01:36.410 --> 03:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
people who would like to live in New
 
03:01:38.750 --> 03:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and quite frankly often don't
 
03:01:40.370 --> 03:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
work very well for the people who own
 
03:01:40.380 --> 03:01:42.190 align:start position:0%
work very well for the people who own
them

03:01:42.190 --> 03:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:01:45.769 --> 03:01:45.779 align:start position:0%
so what I've tried to do with this bill
 
03:01:49.429 --> 03:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
is enable the construction or
 
03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation of
 
03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:53.530 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation of
um

03:01:53.530 --> 03:01:53.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:57.530 --> 03:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
housing for more units
 
03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
so why am I doing this right now 78 of
 
03:02:05.570 --> 03:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
Manchester is zoned single family
 
03:02:10.030 --> 03:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
residential 75 78 of its residential
 
03:02:12.889 --> 03:02:12.899 align:start position:0%
area is Zone single family those
 
03:02:14.929 --> 03:02:14.939 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods are not all single family
 
03:02:17.410 --> 03:02:17.420 align:start position:0%
they contain
 
03:02:21.050 --> 03:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
pre-existing small multi-family units
 
03:02:24.590 --> 03:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow us to do that
 
03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:25.849 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow us to do that
everywhere

03:02:25.849 --> 03:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
03:02:28.849 --> 03:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
and you know one of the questions of
 
03:02:32.330 --> 03:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
course is why do we need to do this at
 
03:02:34.190 --> 03:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
03:02:37.550 --> 03:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
um preemptive zoning is uh
 
03:02:40.670 --> 03:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
not always a good idea often it's not a
 
03:02:43.910 --> 03:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
good idea at all but in this case I
 
03:02:47.630 --> 03:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
think that making a Statewide decision
 
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
is really important there's no incentive
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
for any individual jurisdiction to vote
 
03:02:59.090 --> 03:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
for more density even tiny historically
 
03:03:02.510 --> 03:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate density of four units we
 
03:03:05.389 --> 03:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
need to do this as a state because
 
03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's not going to happen we
 
03:03:09.170 --> 03:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
have seen that
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that
 
03:03:14.269 --> 03:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
um people ask is well why for the reason
 
03:03:18.010 --> 03:03:18.020 align:start position:0%
that we recommend that I recommend for
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
is because
 
03:03:26.210 --> 03:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
four units can be financed very simply
 
03:03:29.809 --> 03:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
with a simple homeowner loan by the the
 
03:03:33.410 --> 03:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
VA the FHA Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
 
03:03:36.590 --> 03:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
will all write a simple homeowner's role
 
03:03:40.990 --> 03:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
for up to four units so four units is
 
03:03:45.050 --> 03:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
house-sized it's easy to finance it can
 
03:03:47.809 --> 03:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
be built by two women in a van or three
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
guys in a pickup truck it's not a big
 
03:03:54.010 --> 03:03:54.020 align:start position:0%
developer project it keeps money in town
 
03:03:57.230 --> 03:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
by allowing us to repurpose buildings we
 
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
already have and repurpose and continue
 
03:04:02.210 --> 03:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
to use the infrastructure that we've
 
03:04:03.769 --> 03:04:03.779 align:start position:0%
already built the water the sewer the
 
03:04:05.929 --> 03:04:05.939 align:start position:0%
existing roads you've heard me testify
 
03:04:11.170 --> 03:04:11.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
404.65 a foot
 
03:04:17.389 --> 03:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
to maintain a road in New Hampshire salt
 
03:04:19.010 --> 03:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
sand plow ditching mode that's not
 
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
Paving we need to use the roads we
 
03:04:24.530 --> 03:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
already have instead of taking on from
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
developers New Roads
 
03:04:29.690 --> 03:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
um so what does this bill actually do
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
this bill legalizes missing middle
 
03:04:35.929 --> 03:04:35.939 align:start position:0%
housing by and missing middle is housing
 
03:04:37.389 --> 03:04:37.399 align:start position:0%
that's bigger than a single family
 
03:04:40.370 --> 03:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
smaller than a big apartment building
 
03:04:42.889 --> 03:04:42.899 align:start position:0%
all of those things in between up to
 
03:04:44.150 --> 03:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
four units
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
making up to four units permissible by
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
right on any residentially zoned lot
 
03:04:52.130 --> 03:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
with Municipal Water and Sewer most of
 
03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
our favorite neighborhoods look like
 
03:04:56.330 --> 03:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
this already we need to be able to
 
03:04:58.990 --> 03:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
create more of them instead of of
 
03:05:02.570 --> 03:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
preventing their creation
 
03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
this bill helps people who are looking
 
03:05:06.410 --> 03:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
for housing it helps people who are
 
03:05:08.269 --> 03:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
living in big houses that they'd like to
 
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
convert into a multi-family it helps
 
03:05:13.849 --> 03:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
municipalities because it allows us to
 
03:05:16.429 --> 03:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
use our infrastructure efficiently and
 
03:05:19.250 --> 03:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
it helps small Builders locally with
 
03:05:21.969 --> 03:05:21.979 align:start position:0%
projects that they can do themselves
 
03:05:27.050 --> 03:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change any of the
 
03:05:30.130 --> 03:05:30.140 align:start position:0%
rules established by any jurisdiction
 
03:05:35.410 --> 03:05:35.420 align:start position:0%
about lot coverage parking requirements
 
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
necessity to conform to the
 
03:05:40.010 --> 03:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
international building code I understand
 
03:05:42.349 --> 03:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
that the Fire Marshals were concerned
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we were saying that a single that a
 
03:05:46.490 --> 03:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
fourplex is the same as a single family
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
house no we're not this is a land use
 
03:05:51.530 --> 03:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
code it doesn't have anything to do with
 
03:05:53.929 --> 03:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
the international building code you
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
still have to conform to all the rules
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
involved in the IBC including for us
 
03:06:02.990 --> 03:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
four units inside of a single building
 
03:06:05.889 --> 03:06:05.899 align:start position:0%
that building has to be sprinkled
 
03:06:09.410 --> 03:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh this bill doesn't change lot coverage
 
03:06:11.690 --> 03:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't change front setbacks doesn't
 
03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
change anything it just says you can put
 
03:06:18.830 --> 03:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
up to four units in here if you can make
 
03:06:23.389 --> 03:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:23.399 --> 03:06:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:06:24.830 --> 03:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
the it's not the end of single family
 
03:06:29.809 --> 03:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
housing you can still build a single
 
03:06:31.309 --> 03:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
family house in any of these
 
03:06:34.490 --> 03:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods same as you can now
 
03:06:36.769 --> 03:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
um the economic impact is amazing
 
03:06:40.730 --> 03:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
because this is a way of adding almost
 
03:06:43.250 --> 03:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
invisible density historically
 
03:06:46.550 --> 03:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate density to our existing
 
03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and that's where people
 
03:06:53.030 --> 03:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
want to live we haven't built any more
 
03:06:54.410 --> 03:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
of the neighborhoods that people really
 
03:06:55.849 --> 03:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
want I mean people talk all the time
 
03:06:57.469 --> 03:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
about oh my God Portsmouth is so
 
03:06:59.690 --> 03:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
expensive Portsmouth is expensive
 
03:07:01.730 --> 03:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
because it's very hard to build anything
 
03:07:03.950 --> 03:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
there and speaking of Portsmouth in
 
03:07:06.290 --> 03:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
particular and this is true for most
 
03:07:07.969 --> 03:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
places in New Hampshire
 
03:07:10.070 --> 03:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
um I have a good friend who lives on
 
03:07:12.889 --> 03:07:12.899 align:start position:0%
Richard Street in Portsmouth and he did
 
03:07:16.010 --> 03:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
his master's work in landscape
 
03:07:20.570 --> 03:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
architecture by looking at the his own
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhood about a four block area and
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
he discovered more than a hundred places
 
03:07:28.490 --> 03:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
where another unit could be added
 
03:07:28.500 --> 03:07:30.130 align:start position:0%
where another unit could be added
invisibly

03:07:30.130 --> 03:07:30.140 align:start position:0%
invisibly
 
03:07:34.670 --> 03:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
if you could have more units on a single
 
03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
lot so it's a really crucial bill for us
 
03:07:41.330 --> 03:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
for so many reasons IT addresses the
 
03:07:43.309 --> 03:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
mismatch between our housing stock and
 
03:07:45.769 --> 03:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
where and who wants to live here IT
 
03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
addresses the issues of Municipal
 
03:07:51.469 --> 03:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
expenditures IT addresses the issues of
 
03:07:54.410 --> 03:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
having enough housing for the business
 
03:07:56.750 --> 03:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
people who want to live here
 
03:08:00.290 --> 03:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
so that's the story on 341 I'm happy to
 
03:08:01.969 --> 03:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative van for your
 
03:08:06.889 --> 03:08:06.899 align:start position:0%
testimony and just to acknowledge that
 
03:08:09.530 --> 03:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
we're somewhat behind in our
 
03:08:12.590 --> 03:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
our hearing process and we have at least
 
03:08:12.600 --> 03:08:13.849 align:start position:0%
our hearing process and we have at least
10

03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
10
 
03:08:15.769 --> 03:08:15.779 align:start position:0%
people who wish to testify on this
 
03:08:17.150 --> 03:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
particular bill so I'm going to ask
 
03:08:19.610 --> 03:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
those that are queued up to testify to
 
03:08:21.469 --> 03:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
try to hold your comments to
 
03:08:25.130 --> 03:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
approximately two minutes so that we can
 
03:08:26.990 --> 03:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
we can move through and hear everybody's
 
03:08:28.969 --> 03:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
point of view and also those on the
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
committee to be brief and succinct in
 
03:08:33.769 --> 03:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
the types of questions you're asking so
 
03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
next I have a question from
 
03:08:38.690 --> 03:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
03:08:42.230 --> 03:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
all right so you said
 
03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:43.250 align:start position:0%
all right so you said
um

03:08:43.250 --> 03:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
you said that this bill won't end
 
03:08:48.889 --> 03:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
single-family housing
 
03:08:48.899 --> 03:08:49.490 align:start position:0%
single-family housing
um

03:08:49.490 --> 03:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
as someone who thinks that single family
 
03:08:55.610 --> 03:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
single-family zoning should actually be
 
03:08:59.570 --> 03:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
ended what would you say to someone who
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
thinks that this bill doesn't go far
 
03:09:01.439 --> 03:09:09.650 align:start position:0%
thinks that this bill doesn't go far
enough

03:09:09.650 --> 03:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:12.290 --> 03:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
single family but you can still build a
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
single family house in any of these
 
03:09:14.279 --> 03:09:15.530 align:start position:0%
single family house in any of these
neighborhoods

03:09:15.530 --> 03:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
 
03:09:17.450 --> 03:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's just not the only thing you can
 
03:09:17.460 --> 03:09:20.030 align:start position:0%
it's just not the only thing you can
build

03:09:20.030 --> 03:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:21.710 --> 03:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:09:25.370 --> 03:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
and representative Andrew booty is next
 
03:09:27.170 --> 03:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
representative van for taking my
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
question I I'm thinking about the
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
concept of Aging in place so if I have a
 
03:09:40.610 --> 03:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
single family home and my kids have left
 
03:09:44.269 --> 03:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
I want an age in place wouldn't this
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
help with keeping staying in the same
 
03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
Community but building that Community
 
03:09:52.809 --> 03:09:52.819 align:start position:0%
around me that
 
03:09:56.450 --> 03:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
would help Aging in place and keep the
 
03:09:56.460 --> 03:09:57.590 align:start position:0%
would help Aging in place and keep the
vibrancy

03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
vibrancy
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely because it allows you to
 
03:10:03.290 --> 03:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
make your house smaller and at the same
 
03:10:09.290 --> 03:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh next we have representative
 
03:10:11.760 --> 03:10:13.130 align:start position:0%
okay uh next we have representative
treeleven

03:10:13.130 --> 03:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
treeleven
 
03:10:15.050 --> 03:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
03:10:16.670 --> 03:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative van for taking my
 
03:10:19.550 --> 03:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
question here in the city of Dover we
 
03:10:21.769 --> 03:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
have what my friend lovingly calls the
 
03:10:25.070 --> 03:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
old house neighborhood and a lot of
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
those buildings in the 80s were changed
 
03:10:31.790 --> 03:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
into Condominiums they were huge
 
03:10:34.550 --> 03:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
mansions and they were sliced up to four
 
03:10:36.410 --> 03:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
Condominiums and then another one in the
 
03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
carriage house but in your research for
 
03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
this bill or anything else have you
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
noticed that that's not happening these
 
03:10:48.290 --> 03:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
days or because it's difficult to get a
 
03:10:50.570 --> 03:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
condominium to be in place
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's not actually the condominium
 
03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
issue the issue is that lots of
 
03:10:59.630 --> 03:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods are uh zoned so that it's
 
03:11:01.790 --> 03:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
only single family so you could have
 
03:11:03.590 --> 03:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
single family and you might be able to
 
03:11:05.450 --> 03:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
have an accessory dwelling unit but you
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
can't have any more than that for
 
03:11:10.910 --> 03:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
example in my town uh there are two
 
03:11:13.070 --> 03:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
Primary Residential zones there's the
 
03:11:15.309 --> 03:11:15.319 align:start position:0%
general residence Zone which allows
 
03:11:18.410 --> 03:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
multi-family anything over two and
 
03:11:20.450 --> 03:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
there's the family District which only
 
03:11:23.630 --> 03:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
allows one or two I happen to live in
 
03:11:25.670 --> 03:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
the general residence District so I was
 
03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
actually able to convert my house if I
 
03:11:30.590 --> 03:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
had lived in the family District same
 
03:11:32.510 --> 03:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
house just down the street a little bit
 
03:11:34.730 --> 03:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have been able to
 
03:11:37.130 --> 03:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow-up Mr chair yes
 
03:11:38.570 --> 03:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
please go ahead
 
03:11:40.490 --> 03:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
I asked about Condominiums specifically
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
is oftentimes people get into that
 
03:11:46.130 --> 03:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
situation and the condominium laws in
 
03:11:48.110 --> 03:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
03:11:50.210 --> 03:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
predicate you know how they put that
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
condominium in place and you pay a
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
monthly fee for maintenance and
 
03:11:56.510 --> 03:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
insurance and all of that yet I'm
 
03:11:58.969 --> 03:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
thinking farther along if there are
 
03:12:00.889 --> 03:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
there I know there are more buildings
 
03:12:03.710 --> 03:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
that if one person owned that building
 
03:12:06.230 --> 03:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
and made it into a four unit
 
03:12:08.809 --> 03:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
they could have following on
 
03:12:11.090 --> 03:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative mangaputis they could
 
03:12:13.190 --> 03:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
have income from that building and
 
03:12:15.530 --> 03:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely get themselves started along
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
that pathway of Financial and also help
 
03:12:20.630 --> 03:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
someone else because they they would
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
have tenants versus owners and we know
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
that our rental market is just horrid
 
03:12:26.399 --> 03:12:27.769 align:start position:0%
that our rental market is just horrid
right

03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:12:27.779 --> 03:12:32.030 align:start position:0%
right
um

03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
for an organization called the
 
03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
incremental development Alliance and one
 
03:12:38.330 --> 03:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
of the things that we urge people to do
 
03:12:43.030 --> 03:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
is to buy a multi-family as a way of
 
03:12:44.809 --> 03:12:44.819 align:start position:0%
reinvesting in their neighborhood
 
03:12:47.090 --> 03:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
creating Financial wealth for themselves
 
03:12:50.210 --> 03:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
and providing housing so yes that is an
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
important part of this thank you
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative representative Gilman
 
03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:54.889 align:start position:0%
representative representative Gilman
next

03:12:54.889 --> 03:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:12:56.809 --> 03:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:13:01.849 --> 03:13:01.859 align:start position:0%
um in your uh presentation you discuss
 
03:13:06.230 --> 03:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh the historical aspect of growth in a
 
03:13:08.990 --> 03:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
town have you found it uh I think this
 
03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
is more question for the general public
 
03:13:13.090 --> 03:13:13.100 align:start position:0%
to hear your answer
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
have you found that most towns begin uh
 
03:13:19.730 --> 03:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
centered around whatever their main
 
03:13:23.389 --> 03:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh industry is and then they as they I
 
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't know grew more wealthy they bought
 
03:13:28.670 --> 03:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
more land and then grew outside of the
 
03:13:31.309 --> 03:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
city center or town center and now what
 
03:13:33.050 --> 03:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
you're asking this bill is let's fill in
 
03:13:37.550 --> 03:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
those empty spots to make it dense again
 
03:13:39.650 --> 03:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
that's right a lot that's a really great
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
question because in fact a lot of
 
03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions nationally and in New
 
03:13:48.349 --> 03:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are less dense now than they
 
03:13:50.690 --> 03:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
were a hundred years ago because of the
 
03:13:52.969 --> 03:13:52.979 align:start position:0%
loss of buildings or because we didn't
 
03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
fill in in the way that we had
 
03:13:57.650 --> 03:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
historically so yes that's exactly what
 
03:13:59.690 --> 03:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
this is it says let's use what we've
 
03:14:02.510 --> 03:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
already got and fill it in and in a
 
03:14:04.429 --> 03:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
historically appropriate way because
 
03:14:06.590 --> 03:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
these are not big buildings these are
 
03:14:08.809 --> 03:14:08.819 align:start position:0%
house-sized buildings
 
03:14:10.550 --> 03:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:14:20.630 --> 03:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:23.150 --> 03:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
sorry forgot to unmute thank you Mr
 
03:14:25.070 --> 03:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative van
 
03:14:28.010 --> 03:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can you say
 
03:14:30.769 --> 03:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
something about about what you think the
 
03:14:33.610 --> 03:14:33.620 align:start position:0%
uh impact of this bill should it pass
 
03:14:37.550 --> 03:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
might have on uh older kind of
 
03:14:42.530 --> 03:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
downtrodden downtown areas uh that that
 
03:14:45.349 --> 03:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
are in fact
 
03:14:45.359 --> 03:14:46.130 align:start position:0%
are in fact
um

03:14:46.130 --> 03:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:48.670 --> 03:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
searching for the right term
 
03:14:51.469 --> 03:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
these are the places that that attract
 
03:14:54.950 --> 03:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
over development in in a kind of
 
03:14:58.250 --> 03:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
unhealthy way would this bill
 
03:15:02.210 --> 03:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
um free free up those areas in a way to
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
provide more such multi-family housing
 
03:15:08.050 --> 03:15:08.060 align:start position:0%
in other areas as well kind of even out
 
03:15:11.809 --> 03:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
the the supply and demand yes I think
 
03:15:14.150 --> 03:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what it does it allows
 
03:15:16.370 --> 03:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
right now we have neighborhoods that are
 
03:15:16.380 --> 03:15:18.170 align:start position:0%
right now we have neighborhoods that are
frozen

03:15:18.170 --> 03:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
frozen
 
03:15:20.510 --> 03:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and what this bill does is unfreeze
 
03:15:23.389 --> 03:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
those neighborhoods and say there's no
 
03:15:26.650 --> 03:15:26.660 align:start position:0%
reason why this neighborhood
 
03:15:29.870 --> 03:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh has to stay exactly the same as it is
 
03:15:31.550 --> 03:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
because historically that's not how we
 
03:15:34.130 --> 03:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
build towns we build towns by having a
 
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
Crossroads and we put some buildings
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
there and then we put some more
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
buildings there and then we make a few
 
03:15:40.010 --> 03:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
bigger buildings and then we kind of
 
03:15:43.610 --> 03:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
oonch out the growth pattern that we've
 
03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
followed for the last 75 years driven
 
03:15:49.190 --> 03:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
largely by federal housing policy and
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
also Federal Transportation policy has
 
03:15:55.849 --> 03:15:55.859 align:start position:0%
been very very different from the way we
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
historically grew towns this bill is an
 
03:16:01.969 --> 03:16:01.979 align:start position:0%
effort to return us to a more organic
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
way of growing our towns
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:16:10.490 --> 03:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
thanks we have representative Matt Fiore
 
03:16:13.190 --> 03:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
I wave off Mr chair thank you okay
 
03:16:15.050 --> 03:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
thanks and next we have representative
 
03:16:15.060 --> 03:16:16.150 align:start position:0%
thanks and next we have representative
Tripp

03:16:16.150 --> 03:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
Tripp
 
03:16:18.530 --> 03:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:16:20.210 --> 03:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative Finn for taking my
 
03:16:20.220 --> 03:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
representative Finn for taking my
question

03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:24.530 align:start position:0%
question
um

03:16:24.530 --> 03:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:27.530 --> 03:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
the uh there's a section in the bill
 
03:16:30.349 --> 03:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
that I don't quite understand it says
 
03:16:32.570 --> 03:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
the lot and yard standards setbacks
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
parking requirements are not coverage
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
Shelby nor more restricted than those
 
03:16:40.670 --> 03:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
required for a single family dwelling
 
03:16:45.769 --> 03:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:48.530 --> 03:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
go ahead is that your question
 
03:16:51.950 --> 03:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
well that that's an error it should say
 
03:16:55.490 --> 03:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
shall not be more restrictive than for a
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
single family house I thought that had
 
03:16:59.150 --> 03:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
gotten corrected I apologize we'll have
 
03:17:00.950 --> 03:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
to correct that
 
03:17:04.010 --> 03:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
um the point of that is that the lot in
 
03:17:06.230 --> 03:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
yard standards lot coverage parking
 
03:17:08.090 --> 03:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
requirements all of that
 
03:17:10.910 --> 03:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
does not go away if you want to put more
 
03:17:13.610 --> 03:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
than one unit there but it also is not
 
03:17:15.769 --> 03:17:15.779 align:start position:0%
more restrictive than it would be for
 
03:17:18.889 --> 03:17:18.899 align:start position:0%
more than one unit I hope that helps
 
03:17:20.889 --> 03:17:20.899 align:start position:0%
so so the uh
 
03:17:24.110 --> 03:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
so the amount of non-permeal non-fermi
 
03:17:27.889 --> 03:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
of uh surface uh stays the same
 
03:17:31.370 --> 03:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
yes so if for example if in your single
 
03:17:34.130 --> 03:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
family Zone it says there's a 40 lot
 
03:17:36.530 --> 03:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
coverage maximum it would remain a 40
 
03:17:39.050 --> 03:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
lock coverage maximum if you put four
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:45.469 --> 03:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
I I still I have a follow-up yes another
 
03:17:48.830 --> 03:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up hi uh on line six of the uh
 
03:17:51.530 --> 03:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
the bill it says uh well actually five
 
03:17:52.670 --> 03:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
and six
 
03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:55.730 align:start position:0%
and six
uh

03:17:55.730 --> 03:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:58.010 --> 03:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
the residential zoning District served
 
03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
by water or sewer or which candy net
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
connected to water or sewer all right
 
03:18:02.880 --> 03:18:04.610 align:start position:0%
connected to water or sewer all right
tire

03:18:04.610 --> 03:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
tire
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
03:18:15.889 --> 03:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
the the multiple uh dwelling flask can
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
still be uh well and septic
 
03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:21.889 align:start position:0%
still be uh well and septic
no

03:18:21.889 --> 03:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:18:28.730 --> 03:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:32.050 --> 03:18:32.060 align:start position:0%
water and septic
 
03:18:34.849 --> 03:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
the reason that language is in there let
 
03:18:37.969 --> 03:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
me explain why it's there sometimes when
 
03:18:40.010 --> 03:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
a town expands Water and Sewer they
 
03:18:42.230 --> 03:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
Skips a lot because for whatever reason
 
03:18:43.849 --> 03:18:43.859 align:start position:0%
the person who lived there declined to
 
03:18:47.450 --> 03:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
be involved if that lot were to be
 
03:18:49.429 --> 03:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
redeveloped for more than one single
 
03:18:51.530 --> 03:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
family house it would have to be
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
connected to town Water and Sewer it
 
03:18:57.110 --> 03:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
can't remain on septic and well
 
03:18:58.730 --> 03:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe that's what it says
 
03:19:01.130 --> 03:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
it says or can be connected it doesn't
 
03:19:04.250 --> 03:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
say shall be connected it says it must
 
03:19:07.190 --> 03:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
be or can be connected if you think that
 
03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
we need an amendment we can certainly
 
03:19:10.969 --> 03:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
look into that but that's the purpose of
 
03:19:14.210 --> 03:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
this is that you can't do it unless you
 
03:19:17.690 --> 03:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
are connected to town Water and Sewer so
 
03:19:19.610 --> 03:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
if that's unclear I'm happy to offer an
 
03:19:21.530 --> 03:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
amendment when we get to that point I
 
03:19:23.450 --> 03:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
will make a note
 
03:19:24.889 --> 03:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative air you have a
 
03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:29.450 align:start position:0%
thank you representative air you have a
question

03:19:29.450 --> 03:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question Mr
 
03:19:36.050 --> 03:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
chairman uh what I'm concerned about is
 
03:19:38.030 --> 03:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
again we're sticking our fingers into
 
03:19:40.010 --> 03:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
the zoning board
 
03:19:41.929 --> 03:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
uh number two I know what you're trying
 
03:19:44.450 --> 03:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
to do and I think it's a good idea but
 
03:19:46.730 --> 03:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
when these when these one family
 
03:19:49.429 --> 03:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods are designed
 
03:19:51.769 --> 03:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
you want to put four units on a lot and
 
03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
hook up the town water and sewer and
 
03:19:56.450 --> 03:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
that's great as long as it was a four
 
03:19:58.130 --> 03:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
bedroom house there
 
03:20:00.290 --> 03:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
because that's how they calculate the
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
size of those pipes that are running in
 
03:20:04.969 --> 03:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
the road to handle that water and sewer
 
03:20:08.269 --> 03:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
so you might run into a problem
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
where a whole neighborhood wants to
 
03:20:11.870 --> 03:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
change to four units
 
03:20:13.190 --> 03:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to dig up the
 
03:20:15.530 --> 03:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
street replace water and sewer
 
03:20:18.230 --> 03:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
which would be a big cost
 
03:20:20.690 --> 03:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
right and that would be up to up to town
 
03:20:20.700 --> 03:20:26.990 align:start position:0%
right and that would be up to up to town
to

03:20:26.990 --> 03:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:29.210 --> 03:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
do now if a developer wants to build a
 
03:20:31.490 --> 03:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
development and hook it up to town Water
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
and Sewer the developer has to go to the
 
03:20:36.050 --> 03:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
town and make sure that there's capacity
 
03:20:39.170 --> 03:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
and can be denied if there is not
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
capacity and that would be true for this
 
03:20:43.250 --> 03:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
as well it doesn't change that okay
 
03:20:45.730 --> 03:20:45.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
03:20:47.809 --> 03:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
waving off again
 
03:20:51.050 --> 03:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
no I I no I'll ask it I keep putting my
 
03:20:53.570 --> 03:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
hand on it up uh up and down thank you
 
03:20:55.190 --> 03:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
03:20:58.490 --> 03:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
van for taking my question by any means
 
03:21:01.490 --> 03:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
with reference to uh being hooked up to
 
03:21:04.010 --> 03:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
water or sewer can you help me with that
 
03:21:05.929 --> 03:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
and and the reason I ask that question
 
03:21:08.210 --> 03:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
is Northampton may be very unique in
 
03:21:09.650 --> 03:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
this that we have an incorporated
 
03:21:09.660 --> 03:21:11.630 align:start position:0%
this that we have an incorporated
Village

03:21:11.630 --> 03:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
Village
 
03:21:13.910 --> 03:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
um set by Statute a hundred years ago
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
more than that which has sewer running
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
through it but the town cannot the town
 
03:21:21.889 --> 03:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
isn't hooked up to it it's only used for
 
03:21:24.590 --> 03:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
facilities at the beach I've had people
 
03:21:28.370 --> 03:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
in that Community say what does by any
 
03:21:33.170 --> 03:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
means mean with regard to sewer so maybe
 
03:21:35.090 --> 03:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
it's not maybe it's not relative to us
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
or maybe we're just so unique but but I
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
had to ask the question okay so I would
 
03:21:42.530 --> 03:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
answer that if people can't attach to
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
that then they can't do this so if your
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
system is set up only for the beach then
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's only for the beach and the town
 
03:21:53.690 --> 03:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
would have to make a different decision
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
um to allow this to happen in your town
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:00.590 --> 03:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
the next uh could we bring up
 
03:22:03.769 --> 03:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Parisi uh from the New Hampshire
 
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal's Office who'd like
 
03:22:09.950 --> 03:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:12.650 --> 03:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
can Mr chair and I've asked him to
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
unmute and there he is he should be good
 
03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
to go
 
03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
03:22:19.610 --> 03:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
to the committee for allowing my
 
03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
testimony I have submitted a written
 
03:22:24.290 --> 03:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
document for testimony and I I won't
 
03:22:26.870 --> 03:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
read the whole thing uh I appreciate uh
 
03:22:29.809 --> 03:22:29.819 align:start position:0%
representative van uh stating that this
 
03:22:31.730 --> 03:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
does not have anything to do with
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
building or fire codes and that a
 
03:22:35.809 --> 03:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
building that was converted a
 
03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
single-family dwelling that was
 
03:22:40.730 --> 03:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
converted into more than uh you know two
 
03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
dwelling units uh would still have to
 
03:22:46.370 --> 03:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
um comply with the the Fire and Building
 
03:22:49.250 --> 03:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
Code I just have some concern that it
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
may not be interpreted that way and if
 
03:22:55.130 --> 03:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
there was a way to add a line or an
 
03:22:57.290 --> 03:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill that would make
 
03:22:59.510 --> 03:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
that clear we would certainly have no
 
03:23:01.370 --> 03:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
issue with the bill whatsoever we want
 
03:23:05.210 --> 03:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
to do what we can to help
 
03:23:07.250 --> 03:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
um with the housing shortage in the in
 
03:23:09.229 --> 03:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
the state so thank you for allowing
 
03:23:10.610 --> 03:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
testimony be happy to answer any
 
03:23:15.710 --> 03:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:18.769 --> 03:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
seeing none next
 
03:23:21.050 --> 03:23:21.060 align:start position:0%

03:23:40.429 --> 03:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
I am I live in Mount Vernon I have a
 
03:23:44.210 --> 03:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
cape a tiny Cape that was built in 1785.
 
03:23:47.210 --> 03:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
I am renovating it completely I'm I am
 
03:23:49.250 --> 03:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
your demographic exactly what
 
03:23:52.190 --> 03:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative van said I am 68 years
 
03:23:54.769 --> 03:23:54.779 align:start position:0%
old I will need some rental income to
 
03:23:57.650 --> 03:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
and supplement my Social Security even
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
though I plan on working until I'm 80.
 
03:24:03.410 --> 03:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
um but I am con I am renovating my house
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
right now so the whole first floor is
 
03:24:08.630 --> 03:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
handicap accessible and then there's a
 
03:24:11.929 --> 03:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
small uh uh two bedroom one bath with a
 
03:24:13.309 --> 03:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
kitchenette upstairs that a small
 
03:24:15.410 --> 03:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
caretaker or a small family could live
 
03:24:17.510 --> 03:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
in and it would be a unit house by
 
03:24:19.550 --> 03:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
itself there's also an L Edition on my
 
03:24:22.130 --> 03:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
Cape that I intend to tear down I was
 
03:24:25.790 --> 03:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
hoping to make it into an income uh
 
03:24:29.809 --> 03:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
producing unit but I I didn't think I'd
 
03:24:32.050 --> 03:24:32.060 align:start position:0%
ever be able to get past the zoning uh
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
Committee of my town what representative
 
03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
van said early was uh there's no
 
03:24:40.130 --> 03:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
incentive for the town to increase
 
03:24:44.030 --> 03:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
density I can't agree with that more I
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
know my zoning board I know my town I I
 
03:24:50.269 --> 03:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
they allow the the what do you guys uh
 
03:24:53.210 --> 03:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
the Adu only because there's that state
 
03:24:55.130 --> 03:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
law that says that you know you can have
 
03:24:57.170 --> 03:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
a mother-in-law apartment legally now
 
03:24:59.630 --> 03:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
but they never would have agreed to that
 
03:25:02.750 --> 03:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
so I want to do two things I want to
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
provide some handicap housing eventually
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
when my house is given over to whomever
 
03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I want to supplement my income so I
 
03:25:13.610 --> 03:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
can what did you call it uh Aging in
 
03:25:15.830 --> 03:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
place and
 
03:25:18.830 --> 03:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
um that is my forever home my forever
 
03:25:21.229 --> 03:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
dream I won't fill up a nursing home
 
03:25:22.729 --> 03:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to give you a little
 
03:25:25.610 --> 03:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
picture of you know what the public how
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
much how valuable this would be to an
 
03:25:29.929 --> 03:25:29.939 align:start position:0%
aging population that's in New Hampshire
 
03:25:32.090 --> 03:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
but thank you Mr chairman for letting me
 
03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
speak well thank you for your outlook
 
03:25:39.170 --> 03:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
and uh the descriptions uh
 
03:25:40.910 --> 03:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative magic booty of a question
 
03:25:43.729 --> 03:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
from this West yeah thank you thank you
 
03:25:47.389 --> 03:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
for uh that was my term of Aging in
 
03:25:49.490 --> 03:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
place and I think that as the New
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire demographic is changing me
 
03:25:56.690 --> 03:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
including uh would that not help to keep
 
03:26:01.630 --> 03:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
our people in our state like you yes
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
were you finished sorry
 
03:26:08.630 --> 03:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely in fact I think I mean I
 
03:26:09.889 --> 03:26:09.899 align:start position:0%
maybe speak you guys would know better
 
03:26:11.450 --> 03:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
than I do when I was originally
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
converting my house thinking it would be
 
03:26:16.130 --> 03:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
handicap accessible for my 94 year old
 
03:26:16.140 --> 03:26:17.570 align:start position:0%
handicap accessible for my 94 year old
mother

03:26:17.570 --> 03:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
mother
 
03:26:19.490 --> 03:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I found that there was a way for her
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
to stay in my home and could have a
 
03:26:25.790 --> 03:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
caretaker living there and instead of a
 
03:26:27.229 --> 03:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
nursing home because we don't have
 
03:26:30.170 --> 03:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
enough spots then I would be able to get
 
03:26:33.050 --> 03:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
some assistance financially to pay for
 
03:26:35.090 --> 03:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
that that was where this started 10 15
 
03:26:38.690 --> 03:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
years ago and absolutely I couldn't
 
03:26:40.969 --> 03:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
afford and there's not any spots for
 
03:26:43.370 --> 03:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
nursing home and I'm going to be her age
 
03:26:47.570 --> 03:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
at some point God willing and yes I will
 
03:26:50.210 --> 03:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
be unless I have a catastrophic medical
 
03:26:52.429 --> 03:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
problem then I will be able to
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
completely stay there and not cause
 
03:26:58.190 --> 03:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
anybody any trouble take up any other
 
03:27:01.070 --> 03:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
resources my one little road
 
03:27:03.349 --> 03:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
I mean I live in a small house what you
 
03:27:05.330 --> 03:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
were talking about septic and town and
 
03:27:07.849 --> 03:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
things my house there used to be seven
 
03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
people that lived in it for 10 years
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
there's only been one me and it's
 
03:27:16.429 --> 03:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
perfectly capable of having a garage
 
03:27:18.769 --> 03:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
apartment you know who could give me
 
03:27:22.910 --> 03:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
income a caretaker three four people my
 
03:27:24.769 --> 03:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
everything is built up the one thing I'm
 
03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
disappointed about is I do have a well
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
and septic and we don't have Town water
 
03:27:31.969 --> 03:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
anywhere close to me so I'm giving you
 
03:27:35.090 --> 03:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
my story and I hope someday there will
 
03:27:37.490 --> 03:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
be a bill that includes we who have

community for myself and my family in
 
03:29:48.170 --> 03:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
this little town
 
03:29:50.330 --> 03:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
last month all this was in Jeopardy we
 
03:29:52.610 --> 03:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
got an eviction notice the owner wants
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
to renovate so he can sell I let
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
everyone know we were looking for a new
 
03:29:58.849 --> 03:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
place hoping Word of Mouth would help
 
03:30:00.710 --> 03:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
people were sending me links for two
 
03:30:02.690 --> 03:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
bedroom rentals for twenty two hundred
 
03:30:03.889 --> 03:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
dollars a month
 
03:30:06.290 --> 03:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
the median sales price for single-family
 
03:30:08.990 --> 03:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
homes has risen nearly 23 percent since
 
03:30:13.130 --> 03:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
January 2020 to 350 thousand dollars
 
03:30:15.050 --> 03:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
a third of our income is fourteen
 
03:30:16.610 --> 03:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a month
 
03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
we're currently priced out of our
 
03:30:18.120 --> 03:30:20.389 align:start position:0%
we're currently priced out of our
community

03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:22.010 --> 03:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
we are competing with people with more
 
03:30:24.110 --> 03:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
income and Better Credit listings are
 
03:30:25.849 --> 03:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
rented before we can call them on the
 
03:30:27.650 --> 03:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
same day that they go up
 
03:30:29.690 --> 03:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
it looked Grim that my family of five
 
03:30:31.429 --> 03:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
would be living in our car by the end of
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
April but my network pulled through for
 
03:30:35.809 --> 03:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
me and someone local let me know about a
 
03:30:38.210 --> 03:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
place that might be opening up we got a
 
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
lease for a house in Dublin we were
 
03:30:40.080 --> 03:30:41.090 align:start position:0%
lease for a house in Dublin we were
lucky

03:30:41.090 --> 03:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
lucky
 
03:30:43.190 --> 03:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
it is far more likely that my family and
 
03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
others in situations similar to us could
 
03:30:47.630 --> 03:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
be facing facing down housing and
 
03:30:47.640 --> 03:30:48.650 align:start position:0%
be facing facing down housing and
security

03:30:48.650 --> 03:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
security
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
we've lived in the car before when we
 
03:30:52.670 --> 03:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
were foreclosed on in 2007. we
 
03:30:54.229 --> 03:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
celebrated my child's birthday with a
 
03:30:55.490 --> 03:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
cupcake and a candle from the grocery
 
03:30:57.229 --> 03:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
store in our car seat because that's
 
03:30:58.490 --> 03:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
where we lived
 
03:31:00.349 --> 03:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
keeping your family safe and secure is
 
03:31:02.690 --> 03:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
so much harder without a home I dread
 
03:31:04.370 --> 03:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
being homeless but know with our state's
 
03:31:06.110 --> 03:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
current housing situation it is likely
 
03:31:07.429 --> 03:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
to happen again
 
03:31:10.250 --> 03:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote in favor of HB 341
 
03:31:12.110 --> 03:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
03:31:13.729 --> 03:31:13.739 align:start position:0%

03:31:13.739 --> 03:31:15.110 align:start position:0%
to speak I'm happy to answer any
questions

03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss French for your
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony are there any
 
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
questions in this French will we go on
 
03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
to our next speaker
 
03:31:25.490 --> 03:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
seeing that I'm going to ask
 
03:31:25.500 --> 03:31:26.690 align:start position:0%
seeing that I'm going to ask
uh

03:31:26.690 --> 03:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:30.170 --> 03:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
match Grays from the nhma New Hampshire
 
03:31:32.269 --> 03:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association who poses the bill
 
03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
please speak on it thank you chairman
 
03:31:38.809 --> 03:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
Dolan this is nature Grace the New
 
03:31:40.969 --> 03:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association we do
 
03:31:44.269 --> 03:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill there are really three
 
03:31:46.429 --> 03:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
three things of concern I want to bring
 
03:31:47.389 --> 03:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
up today
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
first is we would consider this a state
 
03:31:50.160 --> 03:31:51.349 align:start position:0%
first is we would consider this a state
mandate

03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
03:31:53.570 --> 03:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
that would eliminate local control over
 
03:31:56.510 --> 03:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
a particular area of zoning and we we do
 
03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
oppose that I'm aware that many members
 
03:32:01.130 --> 03:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
of this committee are aware of our
 
03:32:02.929 --> 03:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
position on that so I won't go into
 
03:32:04.450 --> 03:32:04.460 align:start position:0%
great detail
 
03:32:08.330 --> 03:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
secondly representative air brought up a
 
03:32:10.790 --> 03:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
a great concern which were the Practical
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have
 
03:32:14.929 --> 03:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
whether we're talking about water and
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
sewer use uh you know areas for parking
 
03:32:20.929 --> 03:32:20.939 align:start position:0%
or Road use one of the concerns that
 
03:32:23.210 --> 03:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
communities have is
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
if suddenly a large number of
 
03:32:28.010 --> 03:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
single-family homes in a particular area
 
03:32:31.969 --> 03:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
are converted into four
 
03:32:34.849 --> 03:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
basically Apartments what would that do
 
03:32:37.030 --> 03:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
for their infrastructure
 
03:32:40.370 --> 03:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
so for water and sewer as was mentioned
 
03:32:44.269 --> 03:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
often they calculate their size of their
 
03:32:46.849 --> 03:32:46.859 align:start position:0%
pipes for you know how many people are
 
03:32:48.290 --> 03:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
anticipated and that's usually per
 
03:32:48.300 --> 03:32:49.269 align:start position:0%
anticipated and that's usually per
bedroom

03:32:49.269 --> 03:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
bedroom
 
03:32:53.210 --> 03:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
so if you convert it and it's you know
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
you can't prevent a family from moving
 
03:32:57.889 --> 03:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
in so you could have
 
03:32:59.570 --> 03:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
something that goes from a four bedroom
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
to all of a sudden having you know uh
 
03:33:04.910 --> 03:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
four couples in there so now you have
 
03:33:06.790 --> 03:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
eight people instead of four
 
03:33:09.290 --> 03:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
multiply that you're having
 
03:33:11.570 --> 03:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
greater demands on Water and Sewer usage
 
03:33:13.370 --> 03:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
which is going to require costly
 
03:33:17.690 --> 03:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
upgrades similarly uh you know if we're
 
03:33:20.510 --> 03:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
not requiring upgraded for parking you
 
03:33:22.670 --> 03:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
might have instead of two cars you're
 
03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
gonna have four or eight
 
03:33:26.330 --> 03:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
you know at a certain point there's not
 
03:33:27.769 --> 03:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
going to be street parking for this
 
03:33:29.690 --> 03:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
number of cars where are we going to put
 
03:33:31.190 --> 03:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
them all
 
03:33:33.530 --> 03:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
um same thing with Road use you know
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
roads are designed for a specific usage
 
03:33:39.050 --> 03:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about downtown it might
 
03:33:41.769 --> 03:33:41.779 align:start position:0%
not be that that big of an issue because
 
03:33:44.570 --> 03:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
you're probably designing them for heavy
 
03:33:47.090 --> 03:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
usage all the time but if it's more
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
outside uh in the country you're looking
 
03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
at something like the geometric design
 
03:33:53.210 --> 03:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
standards which might say you know you
 
03:33:55.370 --> 03:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
have a different type of Paving
 
03:33:58.610 --> 03:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
and the third concern we have is some of
 
03:34:01.330 --> 03:34:01.340 align:start position:0%
the ambiguity in the language here
 
03:34:04.490 --> 03:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
importantly it was noted uh I think by
 
03:34:07.309 --> 03:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative majority about the phrase
 
03:34:08.929 --> 03:34:08.939 align:start position:0%
which can be connected to Water and
 
03:34:08.939 --> 03:34:09.950 align:start position:0%
which can be connected to Water and
Sewer

03:34:09.950 --> 03:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
Sewer
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's no limitation on that
 
03:34:15.290 --> 03:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
um so we'd be concerned that some
 
03:34:17.389 --> 03:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
developer would come in propose a plan
 
03:34:19.969 --> 03:34:19.979 align:start position:0%
he would meet all the Planning and
 
03:34:21.670 --> 03:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
Zoning requirements
 
03:34:24.650 --> 03:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
and they want to build essentially a
 
03:34:26.090 --> 03:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
series of
 
03:34:29.030 --> 03:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
a four unit uh buildings
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
and say well this can be connected to
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer therefore there's an
 
03:34:34.610 --> 03:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
obligation of human body to connect it
 
03:34:36.410 --> 03:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
even though the meanest product might
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
not have that in their plans even though
 
03:34:39.950 --> 03:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
that might require some sort of upgrades
 
03:34:42.170 --> 03:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
and so we're concerned about how that
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:50.570 --> 03:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
okay we have a question from uh
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative man chapudi
 
03:34:56.210 --> 03:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Greaves
 
03:34:59.929 --> 03:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you brought up a
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
question about a single family home
 
03:35:07.990 --> 03:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
going from four or two people to eight
 
03:35:10.910 --> 03:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
in my case when I'm talking about the
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
Aging in place if I was a household of
 
03:35:19.130 --> 03:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh two plus four kids six and then we
 
03:35:22.550 --> 03:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
turn it around and we are just the two
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
of us or you know God forbid I've become
 
03:35:30.229 --> 03:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
a single person and that would still the
 
03:35:32.469 --> 03:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
house was built for six or seven people
 
03:35:35.750 --> 03:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
so instead of having to move and
 
03:35:38.330 --> 03:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
transition won't this give us
 
03:35:42.650 --> 03:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity to age in place I
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
and it in that suburbs yes you know
 
03:35:48.410 --> 03:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
instead of having to move my community
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
where I live won't this give us an
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to live a healthy life
 
03:35:57.650 --> 03:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
I think you bring up a great Point
 
03:35:57.660 --> 03:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
I think you bring up a great Point
representative

03:35:59.750 --> 03:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:36:01.910 --> 03:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
um you know for Aging in place my
 
03:36:03.650 --> 03:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
understanding is in most cases what
 
03:36:05.929 --> 03:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
happens is you know someone lives in a
 
03:36:08.570 --> 03:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
home raises their family they then you
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
know all their children leave home and
 
03:36:13.610 --> 03:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh you know they want to bring in
 
03:36:16.130 --> 03:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
someone as basically a caretaker for
 
03:36:16.140 --> 03:36:16.969 align:start position:0%
someone as basically a caretaker for
them

03:36:16.969 --> 03:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:36:20.090 --> 03:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and the household as they get older
 
03:36:22.010 --> 03:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't necessarily increase
 
03:36:22.020 --> 03:36:24.590 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't necessarily increase
demand

03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
demand
 
03:36:28.190 --> 03:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
um but there are other possibilities
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
um you know someone uh as I believe was
 
03:36:30.239 --> 03:36:31.729 align:start position:0%
um you know someone uh as I believe was
mentioned

03:36:31.729 --> 03:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:36:35.809 --> 03:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
uh you know someone might have just an
 
03:36:37.610 --> 03:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
average house like mine with two or
 
03:36:39.229 --> 03:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
three bedrooms decide hey you know I can
 
03:36:41.870 --> 03:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
gut the inside I can fit make this into
 
03:36:44.929 --> 03:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
four units for small units you cannot
 
03:36:46.729 --> 03:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
limit the number of people who live in a
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
unit if you're if you're renting to them
 
03:36:51.889 --> 03:36:51.899 align:start position:0%
um certainly you can you can charge the
 
03:36:53.450 --> 03:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
different costs but you can't limit it
 
03:36:55.910 --> 03:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
so you know someone comes in we've heard
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
about how people are priced out
 
03:37:01.370 --> 03:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
presumably even small units are going to
 
03:37:03.290 --> 03:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
see high costs
 
03:37:05.450 --> 03:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
um they're going to be in demand so if
 
03:37:07.849 --> 03:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
you're converting my house to you know
 
03:37:09.889 --> 03:37:09.899 align:start position:0%
four units who's to say someone might
 
03:37:12.050 --> 03:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
not come in with their family of five
 
03:37:14.809 --> 03:37:14.819 align:start position:0%
and and move in in one of those units
 
03:37:17.690 --> 03:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about already five
 
03:37:19.130 --> 03:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
people in one of those units we have
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
three more again you have this
 
03:37:23.210 --> 03:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect so it it really
 
03:37:27.469 --> 03:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
depends on what the use is and
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not something we
 
03:37:31.250 --> 03:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
can control
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative to 11.
 
03:37:36.530 --> 03:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Nick
 
03:37:39.050 --> 03:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
for being here today and taking my
 
03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
question in regards to municipalities
 
03:37:46.130 --> 03:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
paying for hookups of of uh new
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
buildings that are in their single
 
03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:48.889 align:start position:0%
buildings that are in their single
family

03:37:48.889 --> 03:37:48.899 align:start position:0%
family
 
03:37:51.410 --> 03:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
zones that have been changed to a Zone
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
to allow the four units my understanding
 
03:37:57.650 --> 03:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
is the municipality owns the piping
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
at the street and if you're a property
 
03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
owner wants to hook up the property
 
03:38:08.090 --> 03:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
owner pays for that entire hookup so
 
03:38:10.190 --> 03:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's not from my point of view I'm
 
03:38:13.370 --> 03:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
thinking it's not an increased cost to
 
03:38:16.190 --> 03:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
the municipality am I incorrect
 
03:38:16.200 --> 03:38:18.190 align:start position:0%
the municipality am I incorrect
foreign

03:38:18.190 --> 03:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
I think you're mostly correct so
 
03:38:23.809 --> 03:38:23.819 align:start position:0%
typically the way these projects works
 
03:38:28.610 --> 03:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
is they'll be a new line run so I know
 
03:38:32.450 --> 03:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
of one project for instance that uh a
 
03:38:34.910 --> 03:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh basically a residential facility
 
03:38:37.610 --> 03:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
for older people their septic system had
 
03:38:37.620 --> 03:38:38.630 align:start position:0%
for older people their septic system had
failed

03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
failed
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
they had to get hooked up to the
 
03:38:43.330 --> 03:38:43.340 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer system
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
as part of that the municipality ran a
 
03:38:49.550 --> 03:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
line down which is called Main Street
 
03:38:52.190 --> 03:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
um and then the municipality offered for
 
03:38:55.010 --> 03:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh anyone along Main Street to have that
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
hookup and therefore they had the cost
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
like you just described for anyone along
 
03:39:02.809 --> 03:39:02.819 align:start position:0%
that street but they they had a a total
 
03:39:04.969 --> 03:39:04.979 align:start position:0%
cost of you know a couple million
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
dollars and then they divided that up
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
based on how many people said yeah they
 
03:39:10.729 --> 03:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
wanted the hookup
 
03:39:14.210 --> 03:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
and there was this standard hookup fee
 
03:39:18.889 --> 03:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
uh but there's also the possibility of
 
03:39:22.130 --> 03:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
you know you adding a line on and then
 
03:39:24.349 --> 03:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
the treatment plan itself not being able
 
03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
to handle that influx of
 
03:39:29.090 --> 03:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
of whatever it is that's coming down the
 
03:39:31.370 --> 03:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
sewer pipeline and therefore you're
 
03:39:34.550 --> 03:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
needing you needing to either uh build a
 
03:39:37.190 --> 03:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
larger plant or or redesign your plant
 
03:39:39.410 --> 03:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
so it can accommodate the new inflow
 
03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
from the sewer similarly if you're
 
03:39:43.729 --> 03:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
pumping water
 
03:39:47.710 --> 03:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
um as I'm sure this committee knows from
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with bills involving the town of
 
03:39:53.210 --> 03:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
Merrimack we're looking at possibly new
 
03:39:55.790 --> 03:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
wells new well systems if it's an area
 
03:39:58.010 --> 03:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
that needs treatment of that water
 
03:40:00.170 --> 03:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
those additional costs as well in order
 
03:40:02.929 --> 03:40:02.939 align:start position:0%
to pump uh the volume that's necessary
 
03:40:04.490 --> 03:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
to keep the pressure in those lines to
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that contamination doesn't
 
03:40:09.370 --> 03:40:09.380 align:start position:0%
happen and everyone has Safe Water
 
03:40:12.410 --> 03:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh follow up Mr chair yes please go
 
03:40:14.570 --> 03:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
ahead you know while I appreciate
 
03:40:16.250 --> 03:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
everything you said and where you're
 
03:40:17.809 --> 03:40:17.819 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
03:40:22.610 --> 03:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
I have to I have to inquire that
 
03:40:25.849 --> 03:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
never mind I'm good thanks
 
03:40:25.859 --> 03:40:27.110 align:start position:0%
never mind I'm good thanks
okay

03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:31.010 --> 03:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
um take care next the next speaker
 
03:40:34.010 --> 03:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh is uh
 
03:40:36.769 --> 03:40:36.779 align:start position:0%
Miss Friedman from
 
03:40:40.849 --> 03:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
I I can I I would ask you to try to hold

your comments or your testimony for two
minutes

03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh can you hear me
 
03:40:52.429 --> 03:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
yes let's go right ahead yeah um uh Mr
 
03:40:55.010 --> 03:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
chair I'll I'll keep it brief Mr chair
 
03:40:57.710 --> 03:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
committee members uh my name is Aubry
 
03:41:01.550 --> 03:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
Friedman I live in Bridgewater uh
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
private citizen just representing myself
 
03:41:07.010 --> 03:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
I totally support this bill
 
03:41:09.050 --> 03:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
um as the reasons already mentioned the
 
03:41:11.450 --> 03:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
the housing is but even before the
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
pandemic this has been going on for a
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
long time this has been building up for
 
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
a long time and also let's not forget
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
the jobs too uh we need young people
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire to you know fill
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
the jobs and frankly they with families
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
and children and they they can't find
 
03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
housing so you know the whole point of
 
03:41:35.690 --> 03:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
this is to open up uh there's
 
03:41:38.030 --> 03:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions that have been uh limiting
 
03:41:40.729 --> 03:41:40.739 align:start position:0%
the uh building of housing now my main
 
03:41:42.889 --> 03:41:42.899 align:start position:0%
point here is
 
03:41:44.990 --> 03:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
um okay I live in Bridgewater I'm a bit
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of a NIMBY myself in that you
 
03:41:50.450 --> 03:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
know we we want to keep the small
 
03:41:52.429 --> 03:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
character and all that that's usually
 
03:41:54.410 --> 03:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
the argument people use we don't want it
 
03:41:56.570 --> 03:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
to turn into like big cities and stuff
 
03:41:58.570 --> 03:41:58.580 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of apartments and so forth
 
03:42:04.010 --> 03:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
so I understand that uh but frankly most
 
03:42:05.690 --> 03:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
a lot of properties already have
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
covenants limiting what you can do
 
03:42:10.130 --> 03:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
anyway so there's already going to be a
 
03:42:13.809 --> 03:42:13.819 align:start position:0%
self-limiting mechanism in place
 
03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
all over the state and it's not like all
 
03:42:16.920 --> 03:42:18.010 align:start position:0%
all over the state and it's not like all
these

03:42:18.010 --> 03:42:18.020 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
multi-family units are going to pop up
 
03:42:22.490 --> 03:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
all at once yeah there'd be a few more
 
03:42:24.050 --> 03:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
here and there I don't think it'll
 
03:42:26.690 --> 03:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
change the character of the towns you
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
look at Alexandria and Grafton which is
 
03:42:31.849 --> 03:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
in the area where I live in they have no
 
03:42:35.170 --> 03:42:35.180 align:start position:0%
zoning and they just look like regular
 
03:42:37.250 --> 03:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
rural New Hampshire towns like
 
03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
everywhere else mostly
 
03:42:41.710 --> 03:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
spread out and not a bunch of
 
03:42:44.090 --> 03:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
multi-housing so it really wouldn't
 
03:42:46.370 --> 03:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
change the character but it would create
 
03:42:49.370 --> 03:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
a lot more housing if you could have in
 
03:42:51.769 --> 03:42:51.779 align:start position:0%
a par uh you know multi-family here and
 
03:42:53.690 --> 03:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
there and it would definitely help the
 
03:42:57.469 --> 03:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
situation and my last point is just
 
03:43:00.110 --> 03:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
um this bill is kind of a upholding
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
property rights which is the big thing
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
for me let people do what they want on
 
03:43:08.090 --> 03:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
their own property property rights are
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
very important but your neighbors should
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
not have a say in what you do on your
 
03:43:16.309 --> 03:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
property and so um it only extends to
 
03:43:18.349 --> 03:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
the limit of your property and it's it's
 
03:43:21.229 --> 03:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
these planning boards and the zoning
 
03:43:23.809 --> 03:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
boards and the busybody neighbors that
 
03:43:26.450 --> 03:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
are causing the problems they object and
 
03:43:28.130 --> 03:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
the then you can't do anything to your
 
03:43:31.490 --> 03:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
housing to as all the benefits that have
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
been mentioned so I would like to see uh
 
03:43:37.309 --> 03:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
property rights have held and create all
 
03:43:40.490 --> 03:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
the benefits that as we've said the uh
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
just create more housing and where
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
people young people can come to the
 
03:43:47.090 --> 03:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
state and actually have a place to live
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
and and that's it I I totally support
 
03:43:52.550 --> 03:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
the bill thanks thank you our next
 
03:43:55.969 --> 03:43:55.979 align:start position:0%
speaker is a lobbyist from the state
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
work and play a New Hampshire
 
03:43:59.809 --> 03:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
organization Bill Stewart who would like
 
03:44:02.450 --> 03:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the bill and
 
03:44:06.170 --> 03:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:08.690 --> 03:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I appreciate it um
 
03:44:10.370 --> 03:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
I will keep it to two minutes
 
03:44:11.870 --> 03:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman members of the committee
 
03:44:13.729 --> 03:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
again my name is Will Stewart I'm the
 
03:44:15.769 --> 03:44:15.779 align:start position:0%
executive director of State work plate
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we are a Statewide non-profit whose
 
03:44:19.610 --> 03:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
mission is to attract and retain more
 
03:44:22.130 --> 03:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
young people here in the grant state so
 
03:44:23.809 --> 03:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
I'll you know I'll Echo
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker's comments about
 
03:44:28.729 --> 03:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
the need to have more young people here
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
in the state and you know for this
 
03:44:33.530 --> 03:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
reason we're in support of HB 341 which
 
03:44:34.849 --> 03:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
seeks to address the number one reason
 
03:44:36.410 --> 03:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
that young people might leave the state
 
03:44:38.630 --> 03:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that's not being able to afford to
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
live here
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining more young
 
03:44:43.729 --> 03:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
people is critical to the future of our
 
03:44:45.290 --> 03:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire as you may know is
 
03:44:46.610 --> 03:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
the second oldest state in the country
 
03:44:48.349 --> 03:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
with one of the lowest unemployment
 
03:44:50.090 --> 03:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
rates and on top of this we're the
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
number one exporter of high school
 
03:44:53.030 --> 03:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
graduates seeking a four-year degree
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
with 62 percent of these young people
 
03:44:57.170 --> 03:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
leaving the state every year some of
 
03:44:59.630 --> 03:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
them come back but many of them don't
 
03:45:01.849 --> 03:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
so in short New Hampshire needs all the
 
03:45:03.769 --> 03:45:03.779 align:start position:0%
people we can get in general and all the
 
03:45:05.090 --> 03:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
young people we can get in particular
 
03:45:07.190 --> 03:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
our businesses need workers and
 
03:45:08.870 --> 03:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
customers as the previous speaker noted
 
03:45:10.910 --> 03:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
our towns need volunteer board members
 
03:45:13.250 --> 03:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
our non-profits churches and Civic clubs
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
all need volunteers to accomplish their
 
03:45:17.150 --> 03:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
vital missions without which our
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
communities just can't function
 
03:45:21.889 --> 03:45:21.899 align:start position:0%
about three years ago statework played
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
commissioned a survey to collect data on
 
03:45:25.250 --> 03:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
why young people stay in and might leave
 
03:45:26.929 --> 03:45:26.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the number one reason
 
03:45:28.969 --> 03:45:28.979 align:start position:0%
we found is that the young people might
 
03:45:30.650 --> 03:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
leave is that they just can't afford to
 
03:45:32.929 --> 03:45:32.939 align:start position:0%
live here our housing both on the rental
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
and the homeownership side is just too
 
03:45:37.250 --> 03:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
expensive and we heard this again and
 
03:45:39.410 --> 03:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
again uh over and over last fall and
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
winter as we talked to young people in
 
03:45:43.190 --> 03:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
nine locations across the state as part
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
of our policy and pint series
 
03:45:46.610 --> 03:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
housing in New Hampshire is expensive
 
03:45:48.590 --> 03:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
for just about everyone as we've heard
 
03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
you know from those who were approaching
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
and or post-retirements uh to uh to
 
03:45:56.269 --> 03:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
younger people as well but it's it's
 
03:45:57.830 --> 03:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
especially expensive for younger people
 
03:45:59.690 --> 03:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
who being early in their careers
 
03:46:01.190 --> 03:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
generally make less money than their
 
03:46:03.469 --> 03:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
more experienced counterparts uh young
 
03:46:04.849 --> 03:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
people also face the additional burden
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
of student loan debt indeed New
 
03:46:07.729 --> 03:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has one of the highest average
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
student don't let Stu
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
debt loans uh in the country and when
 
03:46:13.370 --> 03:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
you're paying hundreds of dollars a
 
03:46:15.290 --> 03:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
month in student loan payments you know
 
03:46:17.330 --> 03:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
it makes it that much harder to afford
 
03:46:19.370 --> 03:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
housing that's already expensive
 
03:46:21.170 --> 03:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
you know there aren't any silver bullets
 
03:46:22.490 --> 03:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
when it comes to making housing more
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
affordable in New Hampshire but here at
 
03:46:26.870 --> 03:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
stay work play we see HP 341 as one of
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
several specific actions that the
 
03:46:30.110 --> 03:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
legislature can take to help address the
 
03:46:32.570 --> 03:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
state's housing crisis so with that I
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
will conclude and uh thank you for your
 
03:46:34.439 --> 03:46:36.050 align:start position:0%
will conclude and uh thank you for your
consideration

03:46:36.050 --> 03:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:46:38.510 --> 03:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Stewart
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%

genuinely not sure who to whom to
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
address this question possibly to
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative van
 
03:46:54.050 --> 03:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
but also also possibly to uh Mr Gray's
 
03:46:55.729 --> 03:46:55.739 align:start position:0%

and uh just speaking from the
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
perspective of Lebanon New Hampshire
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
where there are 13
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
000 people
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
as a member of the planning board we are
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
being inundated
 
03:47:09.720 --> 03:47:11.150 align:start position:0%
being inundated
with

03:47:11.150 --> 03:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:47:14.570 --> 03:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
um mega corporate National development
 
03:47:17.950 --> 03:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
companies coming in wanting to put up
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
two three four hundred unit apartment
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
buildings uh in our city which will
 
03:47:28.729 --> 03:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
radically increase the population in a
 
03:47:30.530 --> 03:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
matter of months
 
03:47:33.590 --> 03:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh and we're struggling to figure out
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
how to supply the infrastructure to deal
 
03:47:37.969 --> 03:47:37.979 align:start position:0%
with with these things and and I'm
 
03:47:37.979 --> 03:47:39.050 align:start position:0%
with with these things and and I'm
wondering

03:47:39.050 --> 03:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
03:47:39.060 --> 03:47:40.490 align:start position:0%
wondering
if

03:47:40.490 --> 03:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:47:43.610 --> 03:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
this bill and the development that it
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
might facilitate
 
03:47:48.889 --> 03:47:48.899 align:start position:0%
could have a mitigating effect on these
 
03:47:51.050 --> 03:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
um on these developments which which I
 
03:47:54.650 --> 03:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
believe are not beneficial to our city
 
03:47:57.349 --> 03:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
and to in generally to cities in New
 
03:47:57.359 --> 03:48:01.010 align:start position:0%
and to in generally to cities in New
Hampshire

03:48:01.010 --> 03:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.530 --> 03:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
I think representative van
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative van give it a shot
 
03:48:12.720 --> 03:48:14.510 align:start position:0%
representative van give it a shot
unmute

03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
unmute
 
03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:16.910 align:start position:0%
unmute
unmute

03:48:16.910 --> 03:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
unmute
 
03:48:19.370 --> 03:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much for that
 
03:48:22.610 --> 03:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
question yes part of the reason that I
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
think HB 341 is really important is
 
03:48:29.469 --> 03:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
because it allows smaller development
 
03:48:32.150 --> 03:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
development that is of a historically
 
03:48:35.229 --> 03:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate size for our towns
 
03:48:39.050 --> 03:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
and it allows local people to be the
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
developers and you know they hire local
 
03:48:44.210 --> 03:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
plumbers and they buy their their
 
03:48:48.290 --> 03:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
sheetrock at the local Lumberyard
 
03:48:50.650 --> 03:48:50.660 align:start position:0%
um doing this smaller
 
03:48:54.650 --> 03:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
has many advantages for towns because it
 
03:48:58.670 --> 03:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
does in fact keep money in the town it
 
03:49:01.130 --> 03:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't concentrate the development
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
in one giant development and it allows
 
03:49:08.090 --> 03:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods to change gradually over
 
03:49:08.100 --> 03:49:09.889 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods to change gradually over
time

03:49:09.889 --> 03:49:09.899 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:49:11.929 --> 03:49:11.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next we have we have two
 
03:49:19.490 --> 03:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
folks who want to testify uh both of
 
03:49:22.429 --> 03:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.650 --> 03:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
one from Virginia and one from Portland
 
03:49:27.050 --> 03:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
Oregon uh
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask before I'm going to
 
03:49:31.910 --> 03:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
let you speak I'm going to ask you to to
 
03:49:35.809 --> 03:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
control your testimony to one minute and
 
03:49:37.610 --> 03:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
I'll first go to Salem Firth from
 
03:49:43.309 --> 03:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
am I pronouncing your name correctly
 
03:49:49.849 --> 03:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
Salim but can you hear me yes go ahead
 
03:49:52.969 --> 03:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
Celine wonderful thank you for having me
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
um much of the testimony I gave this
 
03:49:57.889 --> 03:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
committee earlier on HP 132 applies to
 
03:49:59.450 --> 03:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
this bill as well which would achieve a
 
03:50:01.550 --> 03:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
similar object facilitating a modest
 
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
increase in residential density allowing
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
more homes per lot would promote
 
03:50:07.250 --> 03:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
affordability conserve Town resources
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
have less impact on Forest and farmland
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
and promote property rights we now have
 
03:50:14.510 --> 03:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
experience with reforms that allow two
 
03:50:15.710 --> 03:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
to four unit buildings around the
 
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
country you can see my written testimony
 
03:50:20.450 --> 03:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
for evidence from Minneapolis Houston
 
03:50:23.210 --> 03:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
Oregon and California that the policy
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
change under consideration is likely to
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
result in marginal rather than
 
03:50:28.370 --> 03:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
revolutionary changes in residential
 
03:50:28.380 --> 03:50:30.290 align:start position:0%
revolutionary changes in residential
construction

03:50:30.290 --> 03:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
construction
 
03:50:32.750 --> 03:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
um and I further my written testimony I
 
03:50:36.110 --> 03:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
I laid out three categories of arguments
 
03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
um for when
 
03:50:39.950 --> 03:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
States should preempted when they
 
03:50:39.960 --> 03:50:40.790 align:start position:0%
States should preempted when they
shouldn't

03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
um those arguments are about property
 
03:50:43.309 --> 03:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
rights Which towns should not limit
 
03:50:45.650 --> 03:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
without a compelling reason uh fairness
 
03:50:48.110 --> 03:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
between those who do and don't live and
 
03:50:49.969 --> 03:50:49.979 align:start position:0%
have representation in a particular town
 
03:50:52.190 --> 03:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
and solving Statewide problems that
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
cannot be addressed without using
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
traditional local policy levers in my
 
03:50:58.670 --> 03:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
view single-family zoning is right for
 
03:50:58.680 --> 03:51:00.229 align:start position:0%
view single-family zoning is right for
reconsideration

03:51:00.229 --> 03:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
03:51:01.969 --> 03:51:01.979 align:start position:0%
um please refer to the written testimony
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time I'm happy to
 
03:51:06.349 --> 03:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
answer questions now or by email I
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you for your
 
03:51:11.870 --> 03:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
testimonial our last uh uh individual to
 
03:51:14.210 --> 03:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
testify is describes himself as a
 
03:51:14.220 --> 03:51:15.110 align:start position:0%
testify is describes himself as a
lobbyist

03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
from Portland Oregon uh Neil Heller Neil
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
you best for 10 minutes I can give you
 
03:51:20.640 --> 03:51:22.550 align:start position:0%
you best for 10 minutes I can give you
one

03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:51:24.889 --> 03:51:24.899 align:start position:0%
that works one minute Works hi everybody
 
03:51:28.010 --> 03:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
I'm Neil Heller of neighborhood Workshop
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh performa-based urban planning firm
 
03:51:32.330 --> 03:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
here in Portland Oregon
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying today in support of House
 
03:51:37.010 --> 03:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
Bill 341 because at fourplex is a house
 
03:51:38.990 --> 03:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that the
 
03:51:40.370 --> 03:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
feds so the federal housing
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
Administration and your local banks
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
consider anything one to four units a
 
03:51:46.610 --> 03:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
house and it can be financed in exactly
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
the same way that a oneplex is and is
 
03:51:51.710 --> 03:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
owner occupied and a low down payment it
 
03:51:53.929 --> 03:51:53.939 align:start position:0%
is our local zoning codes that create an
 
03:51:55.790 --> 03:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
artificial limitation on the housing
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
Choice available for people and their
 
03:51:59.510 --> 03:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
various life stages and family
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
Arrangements the nuclear family is a
 
03:52:04.190 --> 03:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
thing of the past and more and more
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
households are one in two persons nearly
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
75 percent of American households are
 
03:52:11.330 --> 03:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
singles living alone couples with no
 
03:52:14.330 --> 03:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
kids or roommates so by by this
 
03:52:16.969 --> 03:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
statistic 10 of the 13 reps that I can
 
03:52:18.290 --> 03:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
see on my screen here fit this
 
03:52:18.300 --> 03:52:19.790 align:start position:0%
see on my screen here fit this
description

03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
description
 
03:52:21.530 --> 03:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
I was the lead analyst modeling
 
03:52:23.330 --> 03:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
Portland's single dwelling Zone update
 
03:52:25.490 --> 03:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
that allowed up to four units on a
 
03:52:27.889 --> 03:52:27.899 align:start position:0%
single dwelling parcel this effort
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
locally was underway prior to Oregon's
 
03:52:34.070 --> 03:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
Landmark Statewide House Bill 2001 that
 
03:52:35.389 --> 03:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
allows up to four units in
 
03:52:38.090 --> 03:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities across the state
 
03:52:40.130 --> 03:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
here locally even in a major American
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
city 84 percent of our residentially
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
zoned land was exclusively single family
 
03:52:48.650 --> 03:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
this was pushing home prices ever higher
 
03:52:49.969 --> 03:52:49.979 align:start position:0%
and Out Of Reach
 
03:52:52.610 --> 03:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 341 does not mean that developers
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
can't build single-family homes but they
 
03:52:56.690 --> 03:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
can now build other stuff too and this
 
03:52:59.570 --> 03:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
will match changing Market needs and
 
03:53:01.010 --> 03:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
important to understand that changing
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
codes does not cost you anything but it
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
is the equivalent of writing a 150 000
 
03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
per unit affordability subsidy check
 
03:53:11.450 --> 03:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
the modeling work that I performed here
 
03:53:14.030 --> 03:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
locally demonstrated that amortizing
 
03:53:16.190 --> 03:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
land and development costs across more
 
03:53:19.370 --> 03:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
units reduces cost to the end user and
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
come in at Workforce income levels of
 
03:53:25.370 --> 03:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
100 to 120 percent area median income
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
so now we anticipate Workforce housing
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
to be developed even in this time of
 
03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
high Construction
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
so in addition we did not come up there
 
03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
in order to achieve a regulated
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
affordable housing I propose an
 
03:53:40.490 --> 03:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
amendment that was adopted to include up
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
to six units if some of them are
 
03:53:44.530 --> 03:53:44.540 align:start position:0%
affordable at sixty percent Ami
 
03:53:47.090 --> 03:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
providing new affordable home ownership
 
03:53:47.100 --> 03:53:48.710 align:start position:0%
providing new affordable home ownership
opportunities

03:53:48.710 --> 03:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
03:53:50.690 --> 03:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
so this bonus puts local affordable
 
03:53:52.610 --> 03:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
housing developers on an even footing
 
03:53:54.410 --> 03:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
and able to compete for Lots in
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
desirable High amenity neighborhoods
 
03:53:58.849 --> 03:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
prior to this amendment affordable
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
housing developers were being pushed out
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
to the edges of the city in search of
 
03:54:04.250 --> 03:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
less expensive land and so again
 
03:54:06.410 --> 03:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
changing these policies cost the
 
03:54:08.330 --> 03:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
community nothing but created a
 
03:54:10.130 --> 03:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
framework where new housing options can
 
03:54:11.809 --> 03:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
be delivered to our everyday residents
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
at rates within the standard income
 
03:54:17.330 --> 03:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
levels these are your firefighters these
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
are your teachers and these are your
 
03:54:21.170 --> 03:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
graphic designers
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
these zoning changes allowed us to
 
03:54:24.590 --> 03:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
stretch our limited affordable housing
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
dollars further or allow us to push the
 
03:54:28.990 --> 03:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
affordability deeper
 
03:54:31.010 --> 03:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
if all they were allowed to do was
 
03:54:33.530 --> 03:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
develop single-family houses the subsidy
 
03:54:37.729 --> 03:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
required is around 550 000 per unit and
 
03:54:39.349 --> 03:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
this is obviously an unsustainable
 
03:54:39.359 --> 03:54:42.010 align:start position:0%
this is obviously an unsustainable
approach

03:54:42.010 --> 03:54:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%

it was heard when chairman Jim Belanger
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
was the chair
 
04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
and it was voted itl because there were
 
04:34:30.170 --> 04:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
at that time quote no Sanctuary cities
 
04:34:32.510 --> 04:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:34:32.520 --> 04:34:34.609 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
unquote

04:34:34.609 --> 04:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
04:34:37.551 --> 04:34:37.561 align:start position:0%
two years ago this bill was brought in
 
04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
by another representative
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
and I was I had a chance to chat with
 
04:34:44.570 --> 04:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger before he
 
04:34:44.580 --> 04:34:45.590 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger before he
retired

04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
retired
 
04:34:48.650 --> 04:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
and at that time he told me John
 
04:34:50.449 --> 04:34:50.459 align:start position:0%
we should have brought your bill in two
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:34:55.369 --> 04:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
and that you can talk to representative
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh Belanger about because he will verify
 
04:34:58.799 --> 04:34:59.929 align:start position:0%
uh Belanger about because he will verify
that

04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:03.650 --> 04:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
now uh I have a legal advisor who will
 
04:35:07.010 --> 04:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
testify uh after mate but I'm going to
 
04:35:10.609 --> 04:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
point out a few of the Salient points
 
04:35:14.750 --> 04:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
about reasons to ban Sanctuary cities
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
let me make one point clear this is not
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
a bill about immigration
 
04:35:25.131 --> 04:35:25.141 align:start position:0%
this is a bill about Sanctuary cities
 
04:35:27.410 --> 04:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
one first Point Sanctuary cities
 
04:35:29.689 --> 04:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
threaten Public Safety
 
04:35:31.789 --> 04:35:31.799 align:start position:0%
they do
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
number two Sanctuary cities conflict
 
04:35:36.529 --> 04:35:36.539 align:start position:0%
with federal law
 
04:35:40.490 --> 04:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
in 1996 law the illegal immigration
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
reform and immigration responsibility
 
04:35:42.480 --> 04:35:43.730 align:start position:0%
reform and immigration responsibility
Act

04:35:43.730 --> 04:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
Act
 
04:35:45.230 --> 04:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
number three
 
04:35:49.010 --> 04:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
Metro cities are expensive
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary cities in 2017 cost
 
04:35:54.310 --> 04:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:35:57.890 --> 04:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
86.9 million dollars in costs associated
 
04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
with illegal immigration
 
04:36:03.289 --> 04:36:03.299 align:start position:0%
number four Sanctuary cities put
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
National Security at risk
 
04:36:09.650 --> 04:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
um just before 9 11 two of the hijackers
 
04:36:15.529 --> 04:36:15.539 align:start position:0%
were stopped on separate occasions by
 
04:36:15.539 --> 04:36:16.730 align:start position:0%
were stopped on separate occasions by
police

04:36:16.730 --> 04:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
police
 
04:36:18.410 --> 04:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
if their backgrounds and immigration
 
04:36:20.269 --> 04:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
status had been checked their plot might
 
04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
have been uncovered
 
04:36:21.719 --> 04:36:23.209 align:start position:0%
have been uncovered
before

04:36:23.209 --> 04:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
the tragedy happened
 
04:36:29.570 --> 04:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
and number five Sanctuary cities are
 
04:36:32.510 --> 04:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
unfair to Legal immigrants
 
04:36:35.449 --> 04:36:35.459 align:start position:0%
and looking around at my peers on this
 
04:36:38.209 --> 04:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
committee I know my great-grandparents
 
04:36:42.289 --> 04:36:42.299 align:start position:0%
came in through Ellis Island legally and
 
04:36:44.109 --> 04:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
quite a few of our
 
04:36:47.330 --> 04:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
forebearers came in by either New York
 
04:36:51.289 --> 04:36:51.299 align:start position:0%
or Boston or some other legal means to
 
04:36:54.410 --> 04:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
become Americans
 
04:36:57.170 --> 04:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
now with that I'm going to keep my
 
04:36:59.449 --> 04:36:59.459 align:start position:0%
testimony very short because there will
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
be others who follow me who know more
 
04:37:04.189 --> 04:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
about the technicalities and ins and
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
outs of this build than I do
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
so ladies and gentlemen I thank you for
 
04:37:10.250 --> 04:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
your attention
 
04:37:14.090 --> 04:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
and uh I will take any easy questions if
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
you have them for me
 
04:37:19.369 --> 04:37:19.379 align:start position:0%
we have questions from the committee for
 
04:37:24.289 --> 04:37:24.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.970 --> 04:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
we do Mr chair from representative
 
04:37:25.980 --> 04:37:27.289 align:start position:0%
we do Mr chair from representative
Gallagher

04:37:27.289 --> 04:37:27.299 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
04:37:29.570 --> 04:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
I see yes representative Gallagher go
 
04:37:30.890 --> 04:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
right ahead
 
04:37:30.900 --> 04:37:32.209 align:start position:0%
right ahead
so

04:37:32.209 --> 04:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
you so you said that this is not a bill
 
04:37:39.650 --> 04:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
about immigration then why even bring up
 
04:37:43.131 --> 04:37:43.141 align:start position:0%
immigration in your testimony and why
 
04:37:46.490 --> 04:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
are there so many immigration related
 
04:37:49.369 --> 04:37:49.379 align:start position:0%
groups signed up to testify
 
04:37:52.970 --> 04:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
on this bill today
 
04:37:54.289 --> 04:37:54.299 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:37:56.810 --> 04:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
representative as I said I went through
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
this four years ago
 
04:38:02.269 --> 04:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
and the folks that tend to speak against
 
04:38:06.410 --> 04:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
this bring up the immigration part of it
 
04:38:09.709 --> 04:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
because that is what they do it is about
 
04:38:09.719 --> 04:38:11.470 align:start position:0%
because that is what they do it is about
sanctuary

04:38:11.470 --> 04:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
sanctuary
 
04:38:16.250 --> 04:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary unfortunately involves illegal
 
04:38:21.470 --> 04:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:24.051 --> 04:38:24.061 align:start position:0%
and that's about it and like I said a
 
04:38:25.970 --> 04:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
legal representative who can talk more
 
04:38:29.449 --> 04:38:29.459 align:start position:0%
about the ins and outs of this bill
 
04:38:31.070 --> 04:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
after me
 
04:38:33.890 --> 04:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
but I brought it up because some people
 
04:38:35.449 --> 04:38:35.459 align:start position:0%
want to make it about
 
04:38:35.459 --> 04:38:37.490 align:start position:0%
want to make it about
immigration

04:38:37.490 --> 04:38:37.500 align:start position:0%

I'm not a I'm not a lawyer I'm not
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
versed in immigration law
 
04:42:55.390 --> 04:42:55.400 align:start position:0%

04:42:58.970 --> 04:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
I would I want to defer the questions
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
about this to
 
04:43:05.530 --> 04:43:05.540 align:start position:0%

thank you representative machiore
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
04:43:20.110 --> 04:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:43:23.230 --> 04:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
in comparing
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill 266 with House Bill 232 from
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago
 
04:43:34.030 --> 04:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that all of the language
 
04:43:38.930 --> 04:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
that remains in 266 from 232 is is
 
04:43:38.940 --> 04:43:40.730 align:start position:0%
that remains in 266 from 232 is is
verbatim

04:43:40.730 --> 04:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
verbatim
 
04:43:43.128 --> 04:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
um the exceptions being a couple of
 
04:43:44.810 --> 04:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
sections have been removed a definition
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
for inmate
 
04:43:49.368 --> 04:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
and I think the cause of action has been
 
04:43:52.368 --> 04:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
removed is that accurate
 
04:43:55.850 --> 04:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative it is accurate
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you

04:44:06.780 --> 04:44:08.288 align:start position:0%
you for a representative I'm a little
confused

04:44:08.288 --> 04:44:08.298 align:start position:0%
confused
 
04:44:11.810 --> 04:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
referring to an attorney is it a
 
04:44:13.970 --> 04:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
personal attorney or an immigration
 
04:44:17.208 --> 04:44:17.218 align:start position:0%
attorney that would be testifying on
 
04:44:20.570 --> 04:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:20.580 --> 04:44:22.190 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:24.770 --> 04:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
I only know of one person that will be
 
04:44:29.208 --> 04:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
testifying and I do not know whether she
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
is an attorney uh
 
04:44:35.448 --> 04:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:35.458 --> 04:44:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:44:36.830 --> 04:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:36.840 --> 04:44:38.510 align:start position:0%
um
I

04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
know who she is but I do not know her
 
04:44:44.448 --> 04:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
credentials but obviously
 
04:44:47.708 --> 04:44:47.718 align:start position:0%
um based on my
 
04:44:47.718 --> 04:44:49.368 align:start position:0%
um based on my
knowledge

04:44:49.368 --> 04:44:49.378 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
04:44:50.690 --> 04:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
of her
 
04:44:55.490 --> 04:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
she seems to have a good handle on what
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
she's doing
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
above and beyond that I really can't
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
comment Mr codification on my question I
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
am just asking I'm not asking about
 
04:45:10.368 --> 04:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
who's testifying but you keep referring
 
04:45:13.850 --> 04:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
to this immigration lawyer or when my
 
04:45:16.368 --> 04:45:16.378 align:start position:0%
colleague asked about the source of the
 
04:45:20.448 --> 04:45:20.458 align:start position:0%
memo it's your lawyer friend or attorney
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
or immigration expert whoever that
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
Turtle term you're using is it it's
 
04:45:30.650 --> 04:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
comes across to me as it's your personal
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
attorney or personal uh
 
04:45:37.730 --> 04:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to clarify in my mind
 
04:45:40.730 --> 04:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
who is this who's going to be talking in
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
depth about immigration
 
04:45:43.200 --> 04:45:45.708 align:start position:0%
depth about immigration
uh

04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:48.970 --> 04:45:48.980 align:start position:0%
representative before you get the uh
 
04:45:53.090 --> 04:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
and that I can tell the committee that
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
the person that representative is
 
04:45:59.690 --> 04:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
referencing to a Sherry Rendell who is
 
04:46:02.330 --> 04:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
next up to speak and offer testimony so
 
04:46:04.910 --> 04:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can uh when she comes forward
 
04:46:09.948 --> 04:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.310 --> 04:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative Phil Evans
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:46:20.448 --> 04:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
um after reading the bill a few times I
 
04:46:23.690 --> 04:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
I noticed there were lots of forces of
 
04:46:26.270 --> 04:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're going to be asking
 
04:46:29.288 --> 04:46:29.298 align:start position:0%
local and state officials and entities
 
04:46:32.448 --> 04:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
04:46:34.368 --> 04:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
um and then I got a fiscal note and
 
04:46:35.690 --> 04:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
money allocated or no money
 
04:46:42.190 --> 04:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh issued to be allocated no money
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
reference to be allocated for these
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
services and my guess would be the
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney General would like to be paid
 
04:46:52.010 --> 04:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
for whatever extra time he or she might
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
have to put in to deal with these issues
 
04:46:58.128 --> 04:46:58.138 align:start position:0%
in your bill as would local officials
 
04:47:01.310 --> 04:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement so what's the plan
 
04:47:04.510 --> 04:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
to pay for this
 
04:47:04.520 --> 04:47:06.250 align:start position:0%
to pay for this
I

04:47:06.250 --> 04:47:06.260 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative thank you
 
04:47:10.850 --> 04:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
for taking my question but I do not have
 
04:47:14.330 --> 04:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:16.730 --> 04:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes I do thank you very much Mr chairman
 
04:47:30.530 --> 04:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh my question is similar to rep
 
04:47:33.288 --> 04:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
ster 11's question which is
 
04:47:33.298 --> 04:47:34.310 align:start position:0%
ster 11's question which is
um

04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:38.690 --> 04:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
immigration requests for detainers are
 
04:47:41.208 --> 04:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
not warrants
 
04:47:44.990 --> 04:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
um they're not backed by judicial
 
04:47:49.490 --> 04:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
anything so I guess my question is
 
04:47:54.250 --> 04:47:54.260 align:start position:0%
if a local law enforcement officer
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
complies with a request for turning
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
somebody over to ice and it turns out
 
04:48:03.050 --> 04:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
that it was a mistake
 
04:48:06.530 --> 04:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh who pays for the damages because we
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
know that there have been a number of
 
04:48:10.250 --> 04:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
cases one in Greenville that I remember
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
from a number of years ago and I think
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
also what in Exeter where that kind of
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
mistake was made and there was
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
considerable damage money awarded so how
 
04:48:25.090 --> 04:48:25.100 align:start position:0%
are we going to pay for that
 
04:48:28.910 --> 04:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh beg a few question representative uh
 
04:48:32.810 --> 04:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer legal questions to uh
 
04:48:35.868 --> 04:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Davis do you have
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
04:48:42.770 --> 04:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
yes I do thank you Mr chair uh and thank
 
04:48:44.270 --> 04:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
04:48:46.190 --> 04:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
question I hope perhaps you do have an
 
04:48:48.708 --> 04:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
answer to this one and I know that you
 
04:48:50.510 --> 04:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
are a staunch supporter of the
 
04:48:50.520 --> 04:48:52.010 align:start position:0%
are a staunch supporter of the
Constitution

04:48:52.010 --> 04:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
04:48:56.090 --> 04:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
and my concern with this bill is that it
 
04:48:59.208 --> 04:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
seems to violate at least in my view the
 
04:49:02.208 --> 04:49:02.218 align:start position:0%
10th Amendment to the U.S Constitution
 
04:49:04.610 --> 04:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
which bars the Federal
 
04:49:06.890 --> 04:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
from interfering with the powers of
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
States reserved for or implied to them
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
under the 10th Amendment
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
so do you not see this as a slippery
 
04:49:14.160 --> 04:49:15.230 align:start position:0%
so do you not see this as a slippery
slope

04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
slope
 
04:49:16.970 --> 04:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
for example if the federal government
 
04:49:20.570 --> 04:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
were to pass bills on gun control or

civil rights or what products could

legally be sold
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
might they not be able to interfere with
 
04:49:29.530 --> 04:49:29.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's rights under those laws
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
and would this law if passed become a
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
precedent that the Supreme Court could
 
04:49:37.730 --> 04:49:37.740 align:start position:0%

um there is a non-profit nonpartisan
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
organization of concerned individuals
 
04:51:15.170 --> 04:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
who believe that our immigration laws
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
must be reformed to serve our nation's
 
04:51:20.810 --> 04:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
interest fair was founded in 1979 we
 
04:51:22.730 --> 04:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
have two million members and sporters
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
Nationwide including about 4 000 in New
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am the director of state and
 
04:51:31.310 --> 04:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
local engagement for fair
 
04:51:31.320 --> 04:51:31.850 align:start position:0%
local engagement for fair
um

04:51:31.850 --> 04:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
Fair strongly supports HB 266 if the
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill was enacted it would prohibit
 
04:51:39.770 --> 04:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions from employing dangerous
 
04:51:42.350 --> 04:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
policies that provide a safe haven or
 
04:51:44.810 --> 04:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
sanctuary in which illegal aliens can
 
04:51:46.128 --> 04:51:46.138 align:start position:0%
work and live without fear of
 
04:51:47.930 --> 04:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
apprehension by federal immigration
 
04:51:47.940 --> 04:51:49.190 align:start position:0%
apprehension by federal immigration
authorities

04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
04:51:51.708 --> 04:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
many expect crimes committed by illegal
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
aliens to happen in big States like
 
04:51:55.550 --> 04:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
California with huge illegal alien
 
04:51:57.890 --> 04:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
populations however many would be
 
04:51:59.750 --> 04:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
shocked to find out that these incidents
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
aren't limited to high immigration
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
States in southern border states alone
 
04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is sheltered its share of
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
criminal aliens
 
04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
in a ice enforcement action
 
04:52:15.170 --> 04:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
um in December 2018 a 44 year old
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
Brazilian native who was wanted in his
 
04:52:19.250 --> 04:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
own country for embezzling smuggling and
 
04:52:21.770 --> 04:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
Firearms was arrested in Windham for
 
04:52:23.150 --> 04:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
assuming the identity of American
 
04:52:23.160 --> 04:52:25.190 align:start position:0%
assuming the identity of American
citizen

04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
04:52:28.910 --> 04:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
also in Windham in 2017 a passenger who
 
04:52:30.170 --> 04:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
was in a van that was stopped for
 
04:52:33.610 --> 04:52:33.620 align:start position:0%
erratic driving rodolgo raxton Garcia
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
was identified as a felon in New York
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
wanted for sexual conduct with a child
 
04:52:42.830 --> 04:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
under the age of 14. in Manchester in
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
2015 Kailyn aldolfo Rivera was charged
 
04:52:48.530 --> 04:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
with possession with the intent to
 
04:52:50.470 --> 04:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
distribute after he was found with 100
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
Oxycontin pills at The Mall of New
 
04:52:55.850 --> 04:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all of these individually were
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
illegally in the country
 
04:53:00.050 --> 04:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
you ask about Sanctuary policies
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policies come in all shapes
 
04:53:04.610 --> 04:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
and sizes some of them are written some
 
04:53:06.830 --> 04:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
of them are not some of them are enacted
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
through local laws While others
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
masquerade as welcoming resolutions some
 
04:53:12.890 --> 04:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
even a Paris internal law enforcement
 
04:53:15.350 --> 04:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
policies however they generally bar
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
state or local officials including law
 
04:53:20.230 --> 04:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement from asking
 
04:53:22.250 --> 04:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
detained individuals about their
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
immigration status and Reporting or
 
04:53:26.330 --> 04:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
otherwise cooperating with Federal
 
04:53:29.208 --> 04:53:29.218 align:start position:0%
immigration officials regardless of how
 
04:53:31.128 --> 04:53:31.138 align:start position:0%
they're enacted or what form they take
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
the uniting factor is that Sanctuary
 
04:53:35.930 --> 04:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
policies place a greater emphasis on the
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
welfare of illegal aliens than the
 
04:53:40.550 --> 04:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
welfare and safety of citizens and legal
 
04:53:43.010 --> 04:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
residents in their own communities
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of cities and municipalities
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
Nationwide have just declare themselves
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
welcoming or Sanctuary these welcoming
 
04:53:52.910 --> 04:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
or Sanctuary cities claim they do not
 
04:53:55.850 --> 04:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
interfere without enforcement but simply
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
leave immigration enforcement to federal
 
04:53:57.840 --> 04:53:59.150 align:start position:0%
leave immigration enforcement to federal
agencies

04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
however this is a matter of semantics as
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
welcoming or Sanctuary cities actively
 
04:54:05.810 --> 04:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
impede the enforcement of federal
 
04:54:08.810 --> 04:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
immigration laws and often attempt to
 
04:54:10.490 --> 04:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
block or borrow free communication
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
between state and local officials and
 
04:54:14.930 --> 04:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
federal immigration officials
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
clear and unambiguous violation of
 
04:54:19.128 --> 04:54:19.138 align:start position:0%
federal law and is considered a
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy regardless of what it
 
04:54:22.430 --> 04:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
is called
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
since 2017 in New Hampshire there's been
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
a proliferation of counties and cities
 
04:54:31.750 --> 04:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
some include chest Cheshire Deerfield
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
Dublin Harrisville Lyme and Manchester
 
04:54:37.250 --> 04:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
but do not call themselves Sanctuary yet
 
04:54:39.050 --> 04:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
their practices make them function as
 
04:54:40.448 --> 04:54:40.458 align:start position:0%
sanctuary cities
 
04:54:43.550 --> 04:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
enacting hb266 will ensure these
 
04:54:45.410 --> 04:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions cannot prohibit or
 
04:54:47.330 --> 04:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
restrict Communications with immigration
 
04:54:47.340 --> 04:54:49.070 align:start position:0%
restrict Communications with immigration
officials

04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately illegal aliens that reside
 
04:54:53.570 --> 04:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
in sanctuary cities do not necessarily
 
04:54:55.970 --> 04:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
remain within that locality
 
04:54:57.890 --> 04:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
for example in the sanctuary City of
 
04:54:59.570 --> 04:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Massachusetts which is only
 
04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
four miles from the New Hampshire line
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
dozens were arrested in 2018 on federal
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
drugs firearms and immigration charges
 
04:55:10.850 --> 04:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
in addition authorities seized 10 kilos
 
04:55:12.830 --> 04:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
of fentanyl enough to kill half the
 
04:55:14.448 --> 04:55:14.458 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts
 
04:55:16.730 --> 04:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
according to the nus attorney Andrew

illegal drugs pouring into New Hampshire
 
04:55:22.490 --> 04:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
and Maine
 
04:55:24.410 --> 04:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
just for your information New Hampshire
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
had the third highest rate of opioid
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
related overdose deaths in the court in
 
04:55:30.590 --> 04:55:30.600 align:start position:0%

Institute of drug abuse
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
most of those are related to fentanyl
 
04:55:36.770 --> 04:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
the majority is manufactured in China
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
and Mexico and brought into the United
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
States across our Southern border
 
04:55:44.208 --> 04:55:44.218 align:start position:0%
according to John Delena an associate

Mexico

affect what happens in New Hampshire he

says that these have much better

04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
needlessly endangers innocent lives
 
04:56:09.410 --> 04:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
there are roughly 3 million criminal

04:56:14.448 --> 04:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
is illegal aliens with criminal records

in this country
 
04:56:20.208 --> 04:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
nearly 1 million of these have final
 
04:56:22.850 --> 04:56:22.860 align:start position:0%
orders of removal these criminals should
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
not be able to continue to live in
 
04:56:28.330 --> 04:56:28.340 align:start position:0%

04:57:02.270 --> 04:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
aliens from our immigration laws by
 
04:57:03.770 --> 04:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
saying it's necessary for law
 
04:57:05.690 --> 04:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement to build trust within the
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
community but by Community they mean the
 
04:57:09.948 --> 04:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
people who violate our nation's
 
04:57:11.810 --> 04:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
immigration laws not the community of
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
people whose laws were meant to protect
 
04:57:16.610 --> 04:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
moreover state and local cooperation
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
with ice does not reduce the number of
 
04:57:20.868 --> 04:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
non-citizens reporting or coming forward

with testimony about being criminalized
 
04:57:25.610 --> 04:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
besides the fact that anonymous tips can
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
be given there are already a number of
 
04:57:28.850 --> 04:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
programs that allow state and local
 
04:57:30.770 --> 04:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
police to encourage victim and witness
 
04:57:33.948 --> 04:57:33.958 align:start position:0%

04:57:49.970 --> 04:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
them to apply for permanent legal status

illegal alien victims a crime from

taking advantage of these programs
 
04:58:00.590 --> 04:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
in addition many jurisdictions are
 
04:58:02.570 --> 04:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
bullied into adopting Sanctuary policies
 
04:58:04.490 --> 04:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
by Advocates claiming that honoring or
 
04:58:06.770 --> 04:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
applying with detainers
 
04:58:09.230 --> 04:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
would be unconstitutional in a violation
 
04:58:11.390 --> 04:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
of the Fourth Amendment
 
04:58:13.730 --> 04:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
the United States courts appeal for the
 
04:58:15.170 --> 04:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
first circuit which governs New
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has never determined that
 
04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
honoring or complying with detainers is
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in morales Lee
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
Chadbourne the first circuit held that
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
for a federal government official to
 
04:58:28.310 --> 04:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
issue a detainer they must have probable
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
cause to please that person is in the
 
04:58:32.208 --> 04:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
country a lawfully
 
04:58:34.850 --> 04:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
the only cop the only court that has
 
04:58:36.530 --> 04:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
directly ruled on the question of
 
04:58:38.570 --> 04:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of honoring detainers
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
is the fierce Circuit Court of Appeals
 
04:58:44.690 --> 04:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
and ends meet simiso versus Texas in
 
04:58:46.610 --> 04:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
that case the Court held that not only
 
04:58:50.090 --> 04:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
honor not only is honoring detainee
 
04:58:52.610 --> 04:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
detainers lawful under the Fourth
 
04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment but that the state can require
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
its localities to do so
 
04:58:59.090 --> 04:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
Additionally the court determined that
 
04:59:00.650 --> 04:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
the state and local law enforcement are
 
04:59:02.690 --> 04:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
not making independent decisions about
 
04:59:05.270 --> 04:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
detaining someone but acting only where
 
04:59:07.010 --> 04:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
there has been direction from an ice
 
04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
agent who makes an underlying
 
04:59:12.590 --> 04:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
removability determination therefore New
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement would be able
 
04:59:16.250 --> 04:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
to comply with a properly made detainer
 
04:59:20.448 --> 04:59:20.458 align:start position:0%
request as required by hb266
 
04:59:23.448 --> 04:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
ice has just 20 000 employees only about
 
04:59:25.430 --> 04:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
half were dedicated to the apprehension
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
and removal of illegal aliens the
 
04:59:29.570 --> 04:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
cooperation of state and local law
 
04:59:31.368 --> 04:59:31.378 align:start position:0%
enforcement whose number is about nine
 
04:59:33.650 --> 04:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand strong is a force my
 
04:59:36.530 --> 04:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
multiplier vital to Parenting out those
 
04:59:39.470 --> 04:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
Among Us who wish us harm if ice is
 
04:59:41.208 --> 04:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
forced to go into the communities rather
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
than secure our environment of local
 
04:59:45.530 --> 04:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
jails many who wish us harm will not be
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
removed and others may be put at risk
 
04:59:53.448 --> 04:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
hb266 ensures this cooperation
 
04:59:55.970 --> 04:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
finally Sanctuary policies tell
 
04:59:58.128 --> 04:59:58.138 align:start position:0%
individuals that despite violating
 
05:00:00.948 --> 05:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
federal laws law enforcement and other
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
government officials will ignore that
 
05:00:04.910 --> 05:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
just because the regulation of
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
immigration is a federal issue does it
 
05:00:08.330 --> 05:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
mean that state and local law
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies must Overlook
 
05:00:13.070 --> 05:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
immigration violations that harm their
 
05:00:13.080 --> 05:00:14.570 align:start position:0%
immigration violations that harm their
community

05:00:14.570 --> 05:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:00:17.150 --> 05:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
moreover state and local law enforcement
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
routinely operate in enforcing other
 
05:00:23.288 --> 05:00:23.298 align:start position:0%
federal laws like gun control and others
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
immigration enforcement should be no
 
05:00:25.680 --> 05:00:27.050 align:start position:0%
immigration enforcement should be no
different

05:00:27.050 --> 05:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:00:29.570 --> 05:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
HB 266 is needed to clarify New
 
05:00:31.250 --> 05:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public policy of cooperation
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
with Federal immigration authorities and
 
05:00:35.448 --> 05:00:35.458 align:start position:0%
for this reason we strongly support the
 
05:00:35.458 --> 05:00:37.788 align:start position:0%
for this reason we strongly support the
legislation

05:00:37.788 --> 05:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:00:41.868 --> 05:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you so much other questions
 
05:00:44.208 --> 05:00:44.218 align:start position:0%
for this testimony
 
05:00:47.150 --> 05:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative Maggiore
 
05:00:49.788 --> 05:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair and and thank you
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:00:52.798 --> 05:00:53.628 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:53.638 --> 05:00:55.070 align:start position:0%
um
this

05:00:55.070 --> 05:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
um this bill pretends to amend RSA 103
 
05:01:02.090 --> 05:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
am I correct
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
I believe that's correct
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't know which section it
 
05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
was amending yes Mr chair of follow-up
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
please go ahead section 103 RSA 103 is
 
05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
the policeman's retirement system why is
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
it in that section and not 105 which is
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
the rights and responsibilities of
 
05:01:22.730 --> 05:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
police sheriffs and
 
05:01:26.090 --> 05:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
um and constables
 
05:01:28.128 --> 05:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
this is a question for your legislative
 
05:01:29.690 --> 05:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
Council in the New Hampshire State
 
05:01:32.208 --> 05:01:32.218 align:start position:0%
Legislature we did not draft this bill
 
05:01:35.690 --> 05:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
we have looked at the bill overall and
 
05:01:40.128 --> 05:01:40.138 align:start position:0%
support the language of the itself
 
05:01:42.050 --> 05:01:42.060 align:start position:0%
if you find another place that would be
 
05:01:42.060 --> 05:01:42.890 align:start position:0%
if you find another place that would be
better

05:01:42.890 --> 05:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:01:45.948 --> 05:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
than I would suggest putting it under
 
05:01:48.530 --> 05:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
Section 105 instead of 103.
 
05:01:51.550 --> 05:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:01:53.750 --> 05:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to redirect my question about
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
the 86 million dollar number that was
 
05:02:02.448 --> 05:02:02.458 align:start position:0%
cited by representative poticek at the
 
05:02:04.850 --> 05:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
in his opening testimony he said that
 
05:02:06.770 --> 05:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
you had information about that can you
 
05:02:08.750 --> 05:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
please tell me exactly what those
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
numbers are
 
05:02:13.550 --> 05:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
sure um thank you for the question uh
 
05:02:16.190 --> 05:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
the 86.9 million he was referencing
 
05:02:18.288 --> 05:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
comes from the fiscal cost study about
 
05:02:19.970 --> 05:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
the Federation for American Immigration
 
05:02:23.690 --> 05:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
Reform uh did in 2017 I'm happy to
 
05:02:26.330 --> 05:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of the cost study to the
 
05:02:29.330 --> 05:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
committee as needed follow-up Mr chair
 
05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes please go ahead
 
05:02:34.970 --> 05:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh and so the opening testimony that 86
 
05:02:38.930 --> 05:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
I guess it's 86.9 million dollars now is
 
05:02:42.770 --> 05:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
not a current figure that was cited
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
it was cited from the last report the
 
05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
most current report that has been done
 
05:02:47.878 --> 05:02:48.650 align:start position:0%
most current report that has been done
um

05:02:48.650 --> 05:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:51.470 --> 05:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
yes it is current
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
I was just giving you the date of the
 
05:02:55.850 --> 05:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
actual study do you have your
 
05:02:58.010 --> 05:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
methodology attached to the document
 
05:03:00.830 --> 05:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
that contains this figure
 
05:03:04.010 --> 05:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
um yes it is attached and I can tell you
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
um that we have been asked that before
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to share the methodology
 
05:03:10.128 --> 05:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:03:11.628 --> 05:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:14.690 --> 05:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you next we have representative
 
05:03:14.700 --> 05:03:18.230 align:start position:0%
thank you next we have representative
Porter

05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.990 --> 05:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this is related but
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
not directly as um an expert on
 
05:03:26.150 --> 05:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
immigration law can you tell me how much
 
05:03:27.890 --> 05:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
does it cost
 
05:03:31.070 --> 05:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
um to go through the process to become a
 
05:03:33.310 --> 05:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
U.S citizen now
 
05:03:35.690 --> 05:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative um I cannot give you an
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
exact figure because that cost is going
 
05:03:39.530 --> 05:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
to be different for other everybody who
 
05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
goes through I can tell you it takes
 
05:03:44.350 --> 05:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and many many years
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
including some people have have waited
 
05:03:51.770 --> 05:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
to become as uh for 10 years or more
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up on that Mr chair
 
05:03:59.090 --> 05:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
so I all of my um grandparents came to
 
05:04:02.208 --> 05:04:02.218 align:start position:0%
the United States from Italy back in the
 
05:04:04.128 --> 05:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
early 1900s
 
05:04:06.650 --> 05:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
do you was it that expensive at that
 
05:04:09.410 --> 05:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
time or I mean relatively speaking do
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know historically was it that
 
05:04:13.490 --> 05:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
expensive for them to come over here and
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
become U.S citizens
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
I cannot answer that question directly
 
05:04:22.208 --> 05:04:22.218 align:start position:0%
as I do not have those figures I am sure
 
05:04:25.128 --> 05:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
that it was quite expensive but I don't
 
05:04:28.250 --> 05:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
know for sure how much it would cost
 
05:04:30.890 --> 05:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
um and at that point I know that the
 
05:04:32.628 --> 05:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
immigration laws were different and
 
05:04:36.050 --> 05:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
people were were you know numbers were
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
fluctuating and so it was probably
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
different at that point thank you
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:51.050 --> 05:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
yes I am wondering why we should listen
 
05:04:54.530 --> 05:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
to any testimony given by a group that
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
is classified as a hate Group by the
 
05:05:01.208 --> 05:05:01.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:03.050 --> 05:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for that
 
05:05:03.060 --> 05:05:04.010 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for that
question

05:05:04.010 --> 05:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:05:04.020 --> 05:05:04.570 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:05:04.570 --> 05:05:04.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:08.330 --> 05:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
splc designates many people who disagree
 
05:05:10.190 --> 05:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
with them politically as hate groups and
 
05:05:11.930 --> 05:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
that has been evidenced by several
 
05:05:16.490 --> 05:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:18.770 --> 05:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you next uh representative
 
05:05:18.780 --> 05:05:22.310 align:start position:0%
thank you next uh representative
trelelevin

05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thanks Ms
 
05:05:27.948 --> 05:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
Rendell for taking my question
 
05:05:30.650 --> 05:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
um I made a note during your testimony
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
that you uh you said that sanctuaries or
 
05:05:36.830 --> 05:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary cities limit
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
or prohibit immigrants legal or illegal
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
in testifying or reporting to police
 
05:05:46.128 --> 05:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
could you clarify that for me
 
05:05:49.368 --> 05:05:49.378 align:start position:0%
um I don't what did you say I said that
 
05:05:51.170 --> 05:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
it limits what
 
05:05:56.208 --> 05:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
my note says that a sanctuary City or or
 
05:05:58.010 --> 05:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
a city that offers Sanctuary or
 
05:05:58.020 --> 05:05:59.208 align:start position:0%
a city that offers Sanctuary or
welcoming

05:05:59.208 --> 05:05:59.218 align:start position:0%
welcoming
 
05:06:01.970 --> 05:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
to an illegal or even illegal immigrant
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
might prohibit or Tamp down any
 
05:06:08.510 --> 05:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
reporting that they might do to police
 
05:06:08.520 --> 05:06:10.128 align:start position:0%
reporting that they might do to police
actually

05:06:10.128 --> 05:06:10.138 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:06:13.368 --> 05:06:13.378 align:start position:0%
um I believe what I'm I said is that
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
welcoming our Sanctuary cities actively
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
impede the enforcement of federal
 
05:06:20.330 --> 05:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
immigration laws and attempt to block or
 
05:06:23.810 --> 05:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
bar free communication so that was the
 
05:06:26.930 --> 05:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
blocking or borrowing goes to the
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
communication between state and local
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
officials and federal immigration
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
officials I'm sorry Ms Rendell that's
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
not what I heard
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I heard you specifically say
 
05:06:39.000 --> 05:06:39.730 align:start position:0%
um I heard you specifically say
um

05:06:39.730 --> 05:06:39.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:43.368 --> 05:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
limiting an immigrant from testifying or
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
reporting to police
 
05:06:45.718 --> 05:06:46.788 align:start position:0%
reporting to police
um

05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:49.610 --> 05:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
possibly you've got written testimony I
 
05:06:51.890 --> 05:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
could look at later
 
05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
um representative I have submitted
 
05:06:56.090 --> 05:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
written testimony already to everybody
 
05:06:58.730 --> 05:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
in the committee but the only other
 
05:07:00.650 --> 05:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
thing I can think of where you were
 
05:07:02.868 --> 05:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
where I was talking about
 
05:07:05.930 --> 05:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
um non-citizens reporting crime was that
 
05:07:08.868 --> 05:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:11.208 --> 05:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
I said it doesn't reduce the number of
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
non-citizens reporting crimes are coming
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
forward about being criminalized because
 
05:07:18.890 --> 05:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
anonymous tips can be given
 
05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement officers are not
 
05:07:21.890 --> 05:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
going to bite the hands that feed them
 
05:07:24.350 --> 05:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
they are not going to
 
05:07:27.170 --> 05:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
um go after someone's immigration status
 
05:07:29.090 --> 05:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
who's reporting a crime or as a witness
 
05:07:30.650 --> 05:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
to a crime
 
05:07:32.930 --> 05:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
I respectfully disagree thank you Ms
 
05:07:38.288 --> 05:07:38.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you
 
05:07:44.030 --> 05:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
again for taking my questions I asked
 
05:07:46.310 --> 05:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor on this if this bill
 
05:07:49.490 --> 05:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
was largely if 266 was largely the same
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
as 232 except for the notable exceptions
 
05:07:54.890 --> 05:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
which I hope I brought out and and he
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
agreed with that and at the time that we
 
05:07:57.420 --> 05:07:58.208 align:start position:0%
agreed with that and at the time that we
heard

05:07:58.208 --> 05:07:58.218 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:08:01.850 --> 05:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
232 there were significant questions
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
about violations or conflicts that this
 
05:08:08.510 --> 05:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
would pose to the fourth Fourteenth and
 
05:08:11.570 --> 05:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
as we've heard 10th Amendment also if
 
05:08:13.610 --> 05:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
these bills are exactly the same can you
 
05:08:16.610 --> 05:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
please respond again I know you did I
 
05:08:18.110 --> 05:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
know you did say something about the
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment in Texas can you please
 
05:08:23.770 --> 05:08:23.780 align:start position:0%
respond to how there are no conflicts
 
05:08:27.410 --> 05:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
with the Fourth Amendment 14th Amendment
 
05:08:29.330 --> 05:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
and 10th Amendment to the United States
 
05:08:29.340 --> 05:08:31.610 align:start position:0%
and 10th Amendment to the United States
Constitution

05:08:31.610 --> 05:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
05:08:33.770 --> 05:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
um sure so with respect to the fourth
 
05:08:35.330 --> 05:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe that I have
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
addressed that with respect to the 10th
 
05:08:40.430 --> 05:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment the Tenth Amendment says that
 
05:08:40.440 --> 05:08:41.690 align:start position:0%
Amendment the Tenth Amendment says that
any

05:08:41.690 --> 05:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:08:43.850 --> 05:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
um laws not done by the federal
 
05:08:46.430 --> 05:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
government are reserved to the state
 
05:08:48.890 --> 05:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
um this bill does is not a federal law
 
05:08:51.050 --> 05:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
this is the state law that is um
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
deciding what what it wants its laws to
 
05:08:54.840 --> 05:08:55.610 align:start position:0%
deciding what what it wants its laws to
be

05:08:55.610 --> 05:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
so in that for that reason the tenth
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
amendment is not implicated with respect
 
05:09:03.110 --> 05:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
to the 14th Amendment this bill
 
05:09:03.120 --> 05:09:04.570 align:start position:0%
to the 14th Amendment this bill
um

05:09:04.570 --> 05:09:04.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:06.770 --> 05:09:06.780 align:start position:0%
specifically says it will not be
 
05:09:09.708 --> 05:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
anything based on civil rights or racial
 
05:09:09.718 --> 05:09:14.330 align:start position:0%
anything based on civil rights or racial
discrimination

05:09:14.330 --> 05:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:16.250 --> 05:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
and next we have a question from
 
05:09:16.260 --> 05:09:18.470 align:start position:0%
and next we have a question from
representative

05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:09:20.750 --> 05:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:09:22.670 --> 05:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
um you kept using the word welcoming
 
05:09:28.430 --> 05:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
communities and Sanctuary communities
 
05:09:30.410 --> 05:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
into changeability
 
05:09:34.570 --> 05:09:34.580 align:start position:0%
can you define where you got these two
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
definitions can you make
 
05:09:42.070 --> 05:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
there are two distinct uh
 
05:09:45.310 --> 05:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
definitions are two distinct communities
 
05:09:48.770 --> 05:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
and to commingle
 
05:09:52.070 --> 05:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
it is very harmful
 
05:09:55.490 --> 05:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
and could you please give me the source
 
05:09:57.770 --> 05:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
of where you're drawing the definition
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
of welcoming communities and Century
 
05:10:03.770 --> 05:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
communities and thank you
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:10:08.090 --> 05:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative we are saying that
 
05:10:10.368 --> 05:10:10.378 align:start position:0%
welcoming communities should be true of
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
every Community every Community should
 
05:10:12.958 --> 05:10:14.208 align:start position:0%
every Community every Community should
welcome

05:10:14.208 --> 05:10:14.218 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
people into their Community what we're
 
05:10:20.810 --> 05:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
saying is communities that will turn a
 
05:10:24.050 --> 05:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
blind eye to those who are coming into
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
their country illegally and
 
05:10:31.128 --> 05:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
effectively restrict or bar or prohibit
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
communication that is what we consider
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
to be a sanctuary policy
 
05:10:40.850 --> 05:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair yes go ahead please
 
05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.128 --> 05:10:46.138 align:start position:0%
I'm still not clear
 
05:10:47.990 --> 05:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
where you're drawing the definition
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
between the two and this
 
05:10:54.170 --> 05:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
is really
 
05:10:54.180 --> 05:10:55.070 align:start position:0%
is really
um

05:10:55.070 --> 05:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:55.080 --> 05:10:56.510 align:start position:0%
um
troublesome

05:10:56.510 --> 05:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
troublesome
 
05:11:00.350 --> 05:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
my other question to you is also the
 
05:11:02.930 --> 05:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
prime sponsors mentioned that you will
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
be addressing the different definitions
 
05:11:09.230 --> 05:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
of immigration immigrants different
 
05:11:12.890 --> 05:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
categories and you would have a better
 
05:11:16.550 --> 05:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
handle better able to address my
 
05:11:19.190 --> 05:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
question of different definitions would
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
you be kind enough to give me the
 
05:11:23.708 --> 05:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
definition how you define immigrants
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:30.650 --> 05:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
um sure sure thank you for the question
 
05:11:34.070 --> 05:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
the immigration nationality act uh
 
05:11:36.650 --> 05:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
actually is the one that defines what
 
05:11:38.570 --> 05:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
the terms are and they have the term
 
05:11:41.208 --> 05:11:41.218 align:start position:0%
alien meaning any person who is not a
 
05:11:43.250 --> 05:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
citizen or a national of the United
 
05:11:43.260 --> 05:11:44.270 align:start position:0%
citizen or a national of the United
States

05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
States
 
05:11:48.050 --> 05:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
they also just determine who may and who
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
may not enter the country
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:57.288 --> 05:11:57.298 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to provide you with a full
 
05:11:59.208 --> 05:11:59.218 align:start position:0%
site of all of those definitions if you
 
05:11:59.218 --> 05:12:00.590 align:start position:0%
site of all of those definitions if you
want

05:12:00.590 --> 05:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
want
 
05:12:02.448 --> 05:12:02.458 align:start position:0%
yeah could you could you please send
 
05:12:06.010 --> 05:12:06.020 align:start position:0%
them uh to the committee I appreciate it
 
05:12:08.510 --> 05:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative van has a question
 
05:12:08.520 --> 05:12:11.750 align:start position:0%
representative van has a question
okay

05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:14.090 --> 05:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent thank you
 
05:12:16.670 --> 05:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
chairman Dolan thank you uh Ms Lindell
 
05:12:21.070 --> 05:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
my question is I had always understood
 
05:12:24.970 --> 05:12:24.980 align:start position:0%
that immigration violations are not
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
criminal violations in the same way that
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know robbing somebody is can you
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
speak to that that violating uh so the
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
question is if I violate the immigration
 
05:12:39.770 --> 05:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
laws have I committed a crime or have I
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
done something less than a criminal act
 
05:12:47.050 --> 05:12:47.060 align:start position:0%
yeah representative most uh immigration
 
05:12:50.090 --> 05:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
violations are civil and nature there
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
are some that are criminals such as
 
05:12:55.670 --> 05:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
re-entry and so I hope that addresses
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
your question
 
05:13:00.410 --> 05:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
now representative the Salas has a
 
05:13:00.420 --> 05:13:01.190 align:start position:0%
now representative the Salas has a
question

05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:13:01.200 --> 05:13:02.448 align:start position:0%
question
yes

05:13:02.448 --> 05:13:02.458 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:13:05.628 --> 05:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question I'm
 
05:13:08.990 --> 05:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
a great believer in the rule of law
 
05:13:13.970 --> 05:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
in this country we have uh 50 states and
 
05:13:17.330 --> 05:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
literally thousands of cities and
 
05:13:17.340 --> 05:13:19.208 align:start position:0%
literally thousands of cities and
municipalities

05:13:19.208 --> 05:13:19.218 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
05:13:23.470 --> 05:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh that all have their own sets of
 
05:13:28.510 --> 05:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances and laws and so forth
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
what government entity is responsible
 
05:13:33.080 --> 05:13:34.990 align:start position:0%
what government entity is responsible
for

05:13:34.990 --> 05:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:13:39.250 --> 05:13:39.260 align:start position:0%
establishing the overall immigration
 
05:13:44.448 --> 05:13:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
right now Congress
 
05:13:49.070 --> 05:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
um is the one that establishes our
 
05:13:51.890 --> 05:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
immigration law most of it
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you a follow-up Mr chairman so
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
if Congress is responsible for
 
05:14:01.010 --> 05:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
establishing the law
 
05:14:05.330 --> 05:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
and we have established immigration law
 
05:14:07.610 --> 05:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
that is on the books
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
then I think it behooves every law
 
05:14:15.708 --> 05:14:15.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer No Matter What
 
05:14:22.128 --> 05:14:22.138 align:start position:0%
entity that he is uh is involved with to
 
05:14:25.390 --> 05:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
participate in in
 
05:14:29.570 --> 05:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.930 --> 05:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
05:14:36.650 --> 05:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:40.368 --> 05:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative uh status do
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
you have an additional question or do
 
05:14:43.490 --> 05:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
you want to wave off
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:49.368 --> 05:14:49.378 align:start position:0%
yes thank you again Mr chair and thank
 
05:14:51.170 --> 05:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I apologize
 
05:14:52.910 --> 05:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
the the bill that I printed off did not
 
05:14:54.650 --> 05:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
have the line number so I apologize for
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
not citing it by line number but in
 
05:15:01.850 --> 05:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
proposed section 103 Dash a colon 3
 
05:15:05.208 --> 05:15:05.218 align:start position:0%
Roman 1 sub a
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
fully comply with honor and fulfill any
 
05:15:09.948 --> 05:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
instruction or requests made in the
 
05:15:11.810 --> 05:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
detainer request and in any other legal
 
05:15:14.810 --> 05:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
document provided by a federal agency
 
05:15:17.090 --> 05:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
um there there and this question was
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
asked before I assume that there will be
 
05:15:21.230 --> 05:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
costs for this and those costs will be
 
05:15:23.330 --> 05:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
will be
 
05:15:26.448 --> 05:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
um uh will will be born by the local
 
05:15:29.990 --> 05:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
agency so it's a two-part question are
 
05:15:33.230 --> 05:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
those costs reimbursable by the federal
 
05:15:37.970 --> 05:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:40.730 --> 05:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
so representative I just want to clarify
 
05:15:42.530 --> 05:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
there uh there are always costs
 
05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
associated with with law enforcement
 
05:15:46.430 --> 05:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
complying with things and I can tell you
 
05:15:49.610 --> 05:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
that uh immigration officers are not the
 
05:15:52.128 --> 05:15:52.138 align:start position:0%
only ones to issue detainers and yet
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
detainers are not an issue when the US
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
Marshals or other or other law
 
05:15:58.788 --> 05:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers issue them the only
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
time they seem to be an issue is when it
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
is in the realm of immigration law with
 
05:16:07.550 --> 05:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
respect to reimbursement of costs um
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
some of them can be possibly reimbursed
 
05:16:12.050 --> 05:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
through the state Criminal Alien
 
05:16:14.208 --> 05:16:14.218 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
05:16:16.970 --> 05:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
um there are some other alternatives for
 
05:16:17.990 --> 05:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
05:16:19.970 --> 05:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair quick follow-up to
 
05:16:22.128 --> 05:16:22.138 align:start position:0%
that go ahead
 
05:16:26.208 --> 05:16:26.218 align:start position:0%
um so then I'm curious if you feel that
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
there may be any issue with uh with
 
05:16:33.410 --> 05:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates as we have uh which
 
05:16:36.708 --> 05:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
are which we have in RSA 28a if those
 
05:16:41.690 --> 05:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:44.510 --> 05:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I do not believe this was an unfunded
 
05:16:46.910 --> 05:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
mandate this would be the same directing
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
its localities to follow a state law
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
um it's not a mandate by the federal
 
05:16:52.680 --> 05:16:53.890 align:start position:0%
um it's not a mandate by the federal
government

05:16:53.890 --> 05:16:53.900 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:16:56.770 --> 05:16:56.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:16:58.910 --> 05:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair thank you
 
05:17:02.638 --> 05:17:03.770 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair thank you
um

05:17:03.770 --> 05:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:08.330 --> 05:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of putting it
 
05:17:12.770 --> 05:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
very as a matter of fact
 
05:17:15.250 --> 05:17:15.260 align:start position:0%
how would you
 
05:17:21.050 --> 05:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
describe how would the local authorities
 
05:17:24.288 --> 05:17:24.298 align:start position:0%
find and prosecute
 
05:17:27.288 --> 05:17:27.298 align:start position:0%
or bring people
 
05:17:30.650 --> 05:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:33.010 --> 05:17:33.020 align:start position:0%
based on
 
05:17:35.448 --> 05:17:35.458 align:start position:0%
immigration status
 
05:17:40.670 --> 05:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
so are you suggesting that I as a
 
05:17:43.850 --> 05:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
naturalized citizen should have to carry
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
a card so that I can protect myself from
 
05:17:54.890 --> 05:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
any stop or unnecessary rust because I
 
05:17:57.550 --> 05:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
look different
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative absolutely not we firmly
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe that in legal immigration what
 
05:18:09.110 --> 05:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
is uh not the officer's job to go out
 
05:18:11.810 --> 05:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
and round people up but if somebody is
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the jail system then if if the uh
 
05:18:19.570 --> 05:18:19.580 align:start position:0%
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
 
05:18:22.670 --> 05:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
finds that and individuals in jail they
 
05:18:25.208 --> 05:18:25.218 align:start position:0%
will issue a detainer and at that point
 
05:18:28.070 --> 05:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
we want the officers to be able to
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
comply with the detainer request
 
05:18:37.610 --> 05:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:40.368 --> 05:18:40.378 align:start position:0%
let me calm down
 
05:18:43.788 --> 05:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry let me calm down okay I'll
 
05:18:47.150 --> 05:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
come back to you all right um I'm ready
 
05:18:51.590 --> 05:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead how how would you
 
05:18:51.600 --> 05:18:54.410 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead how how would you
characterize

05:18:54.410 --> 05:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
characterize
 
05:18:57.050 --> 05:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
legal immigrants illegal immigrants
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
without racial profiling or who are
 
05:19:01.200 --> 05:19:03.050 align:start position:0%
without racial profiling or who are
detained

05:19:03.050 --> 05:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
detained
 
05:19:03.060 --> 05:19:04.490 align:start position:0%
detained
so

05:19:04.490 --> 05:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:19:08.030 --> 05:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
are you defining
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:12.240 --> 05:19:13.628 align:start position:0%
 
as

05:19:13.628 --> 05:19:13.638 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:19:18.170 --> 05:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants or criminals
 
05:19:21.948 --> 05:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
and isn't the law says unless proven
 
05:19:26.208 --> 05:19:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:28.128 --> 05:19:28.138 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure where you
 
05:19:31.070 --> 05:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
got that from what I am saying is ice
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
has to determine whether someone is
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
removable or not they have to have
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause when they issue a
 
05:19:41.690 --> 05:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
detainer there is a probable cause that
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
is attached to that detainer and once
 
05:19:47.170 --> 05:19:47.180 align:start position:0%
that is presented to law enforcement
 
05:19:49.610 --> 05:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
only at that point would the law
 
05:19:52.850 --> 05:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer hold the individual
 
05:19:56.448 --> 05:19:56.458 align:start position:0%
for up to 48 hours it's only up to 48
 
05:19:56.458 --> 05:19:57.650 align:start position:0%
for up to 48 hours it's only up to 48
Hours

05:19:57.650 --> 05:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
Hours
 
05:20:00.010 --> 05:20:00.020 align:start position:0%
um for ice
 
05:20:02.750 --> 05:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
the now I'm not quite sure what you are
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
asking with legal immigrant versus
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
someone here illegally I didn't quite
 
05:20:10.910 --> 05:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
follow that and if you can clarify you
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
know how you define
 
05:20:18.590 --> 05:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
how can visually our local officers
 
05:20:22.610 --> 05:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
figure out we need to let the uh
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
those testify and answer the question if
 
05:20:26.090 --> 05:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
you want to follow up you need to
 
05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
request a follow-up I don't want to have
 
05:20:31.250 --> 05:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
a uh I'm going to dialogue to chat I
 
05:20:33.050 --> 05:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
will shut up
 
05:20:37.610 --> 05:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:40.250 --> 05:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks Ms Rendell
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
for taking another question uh I'm a tad
 
05:20:42.958 --> 05:20:46.010 align:start position:0%
for taking another question uh I'm a tad
confused

05:20:46.010 --> 05:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.270 --> 05:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
ice is a federal government entity is
 
05:20:52.368 --> 05:20:52.378 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am thank you and the federal
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
government has control over the
 
05:21:00.650 --> 05:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
immigration laws of the entire United
 
05:21:04.850 --> 05:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:07.010 --> 05:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
that immigration is a federal issue yes
 
05:21:10.250 --> 05:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you and immigration is a civil
 
05:21:14.448 --> 05:21:14.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:17.208 --> 05:21:17.218 align:start position:0%
um that is correct under our immigration
 
05:21:21.890 --> 05:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
laws the ice enforcement has civil uh
 
05:21:26.270 --> 05:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
Authority and under the Ina they have
 
05:21:29.030 --> 05:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to arrest detain or remove
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who have
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
illegally entered this country and who
 
05:21:36.650 --> 05:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
are removable
 
05:21:39.890 --> 05:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
let me let me jump out I want I want to
 
05:21:42.410 --> 05:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to please limit
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
yourself to one question at a time and
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh and then because we have so many
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
so many people wanting to testify what
 
05:21:52.550 --> 05:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
if you need to follow-up to staff
 
05:21:54.590 --> 05:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry Mr chair may I have one
 
05:21:56.990 --> 05:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
more follow-up yes please
 
05:22:00.230 --> 05:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
I asked the questions in those ways to
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
clarify this is my last question and I
 
05:22:06.288 --> 05:22:06.298 align:start position:0%
think Ms Rendell has answered it but it
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
will help to clarify so what I want to
 
05:22:14.208 --> 05:22:14.218 align:start position:0%
understand is how ice involves our state
 
05:22:16.670 --> 05:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
county and local law enforcement
 
05:22:21.170 --> 05:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
officers in detaining quote unquote
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
potential illegal immigrants if they
 
05:22:27.368 --> 05:22:27.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative they have ice has the
 
05:22:33.288 --> 05:22:33.298 align:start position:0%
authority to issue a civil detainer
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
under the Ina that is a simple request
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
issued to law enforcement officers in
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
the same way that another law
 
05:22:45.110 --> 05:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency would issue a
 
05:22:47.208 --> 05:22:47.218 align:start position:0%
detainer to a local or state law
 
05:22:49.970 --> 05:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency this is not a matter
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
of a criminal or civil violation what
 
05:22:57.530 --> 05:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
we're saying is this is the issuance of
 
05:23:00.050 --> 05:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
a detainer request
 
05:23:02.208 --> 05:23:02.218 align:start position:0%
is that clarifying what you were asking
 
05:23:05.208 --> 05:23:05.218 align:start position:0%
me yes thank you
 
05:23:07.490 --> 05:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh question from
 
05:23:16.970 --> 05:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
we don't have police officers New
 
05:23:21.288 --> 05:23:21.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire going and kicking down doors
 
05:23:26.030 --> 05:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:30.360 --> 05:23:32.448 align:start position:0%
 
default

05:23:32.448 --> 05:23:32.458 align:start position:0%
default
 
05:23:34.970 --> 05:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that
 
05:23:37.310 --> 05:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
a large majority probably 90 plus
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
percent of people that
 
05:23:42.050 --> 05:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
are detained by law enforcement is due
 
05:23:45.770 --> 05:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
to them being stopped from committing a
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
previous crime and that's how their
 
05:23:50.330 --> 05:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
contact has been has happened
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
the majority is either they were because
 
05:23:56.448 --> 05:23:56.458 align:start position:0%
of a crime or in the jails where their
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
name or information was run through the
 
05:24:00.650 --> 05:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
system and Ice has been able to
 
05:24:02.810 --> 05:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
determine that they have an interest in
 
05:24:05.330 --> 05:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
05:24:07.250 --> 05:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to take one more question
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
for this witness from uh the minority
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
leader and then I'm going to move on to
 
05:24:14.330 --> 05:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
the next witness we have like I said
 
05:24:16.490 --> 05:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
about 15 people who still want to
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
testify so representative Porter
 
05:24:21.770 --> 05:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I guess I'm just a
 
05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
little confused and I'd like a
 
05:24:23.040 --> 05:24:24.288 align:start position:0%
little confused and I'd like a
clarification

05:24:24.288 --> 05:24:24.298 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
um Miss Rendell
 
05:24:28.550 --> 05:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
in in answering um representative to
 
05:24:30.890 --> 05:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
11's question you said that it was a it
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
was a civil detainer and it was a simple
 
05:24:37.490 --> 05:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
request to law enforcement
 
05:24:41.810 --> 05:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
so can they under the provisions of this
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill law enforcement would not be able
 
05:24:44.400 --> 05:24:45.650 align:start position:0%
bill law enforcement would not be able
to

05:24:45.650 --> 05:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:24:45.660 --> 05:24:46.868 align:start position:0%
to
um

05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:49.368 --> 05:24:49.378 align:start position:0%
not not comply with the request they
 
05:24:51.650 --> 05:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the option you know they
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
come and say we want you to he has a
 
05:24:55.970 --> 05:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
request for a detainer an irlr
 
05:24:58.670 --> 05:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers could not say no is
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
that what this bill would do under this
 
05:25:03.948 --> 05:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
bill the the state law would require
 
05:25:06.948 --> 05:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
them to comply with uh detailing they
 
05:25:09.890 --> 05:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
would be forced to comply to a request
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%

05:25:44.948 --> 05:25:44.958 align:start position:0%
30 questions already
 
05:25:48.530 --> 05:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
so at this point I'd like to move on and
 
05:25:50.810 --> 05:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
and invite
 
05:25:54.288 --> 05:25:54.298 align:start position:0%

05:25:59.690 --> 05:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:06.170 --> 05:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:06.180 --> 05:26:08.948 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:26:08.948 --> 05:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:26:12.948 --> 05:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
don't see her chair I do not see and
 
05:26:15.470 --> 05:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
since Vanessa Blaze is a member of the
 
05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
public I do not have any other way other
 
05:26:21.230 --> 05:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
than her first and last name to try to
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
find her if you wouldn't mind that I'll
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%

05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%

05:26:51.410 --> 05:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we can find someone that's
 
05:26:55.330 --> 05:26:55.340 align:start position:0%
there uh we have a lobbyists
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%

05:27:13.128 --> 05:27:13.138 align:start position:0%
um so I do see grace kandiki and should
 
05:27:15.410 --> 05:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
be all set to go all right thank you and
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:22.010 --> 05:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you hello and thank you to the
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee for taking my um giving me the
 
05:27:25.550 --> 05:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Grace
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
condecke and I am the program
 
05:27:28.670 --> 05:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
coordinator with the American friend
 
05:27:30.050 --> 05:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
service committee
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
um and I'm also from Manchester and have
 
05:27:33.170 --> 05:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
lived the majority of my life in the
 
05:27:35.150 --> 05:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
granite state after immigrating here as
 
05:27:38.330 --> 05:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
a toddler in 1989. I know firsthand what
 
05:27:39.470 --> 05:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's like to live is both an
 
05:27:41.868 --> 05:27:41.878 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrant and a documented
 
05:27:44.208 --> 05:27:44.218 align:start position:0%
one in the granite state I'm here in
 
05:27:47.208 --> 05:27:47.218 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 266 and urged the
 
05:27:48.770 --> 05:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
committee to Market in expedient to
 
05:27:51.170 --> 05:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
legislate the foremost and direct impact
 
05:27:52.970 --> 05:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
of this bill would be to undermine
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
relationships between residents and law
 
05:27:57.288 --> 05:27:57.298 align:start position:0%
enforcement it would it would make
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
exponentially less safe for people to
 
05:28:01.850 --> 05:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
rely on police because as an immigrant
 
05:28:04.310 --> 05:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
every encounter with police can turn
 
05:28:06.170 --> 05:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
into a very real possibility of being
 
05:28:08.990 --> 05:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
detained and later deported prohibiting
 
05:28:10.788 --> 05:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
local communities from taking actions to
 
05:28:12.470 --> 05:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
prevent cooperation with Federal
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
immigration enforcement means that
 
05:28:16.190 --> 05:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
formal and informal Cooperative
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
agreements will endanger the growing
 
05:28:20.090 --> 05:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
Community immigrant community of the
 
05:28:22.368 --> 05:28:22.378 align:start position:0%
granite state which totals over 83 000
 
05:28:24.170 --> 05:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
immigrants these are people are our
 
05:28:26.270 --> 05:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
loved ones our family members our
 
05:28:28.970 --> 05:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
neighbors they are taxpayers workers and
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
business owners
 
05:28:32.690 --> 05:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
when I was a very little girl I'll tell
 
05:28:34.430 --> 05:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
you a story about living in Manchester
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
when I was a very little girl in early
 
05:28:38.750 --> 05:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
Elementary School I got separated from
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
my aunts and found myself lost in a
 
05:28:43.310 --> 05:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
department store in my child mind I
 
05:28:44.990 --> 05:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
thought the best thing I could do was to
 
05:28:47.270 --> 05:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
leave the store and go find my mama who
 
05:28:49.430 --> 05:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
was working at the time I walked by
 
05:28:52.368 --> 05:28:52.378 align:start position:0%
myself at night down Hanover Street in
 
05:28:54.170 --> 05:28:54.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester until an older white couple
 
05:28:56.448 --> 05:28:56.458 align:start position:0%
who were out for a stroll heard me
 
05:28:58.970 --> 05:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
crying and stopped me they took me to a
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
nearby convenience store bought me a
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
snack and called the police who came and
 
05:29:05.330 --> 05:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
picked me up a very kind officer took me
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
to the local police station on Pine
 
05:29:09.230 --> 05:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
Street found my frantic aunt and helped
 
05:29:11.868 --> 05:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
to reunite us I was undocumented at the
 
05:29:13.490 --> 05:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
time although I didn't know it because I
 
05:29:15.650 --> 05:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
was so young and if at any point in time
 
05:29:17.330 --> 05:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
the officer had asked my family their
 
05:29:19.190 --> 05:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
immigration status as I likely would
 
05:29:20.270 --> 05:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
have because they would have taken
 
05:29:22.610 --> 05:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
identifying information to ensure that
 
05:29:24.170 --> 05:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
they're matching the right child in the
 
05:29:26.690 --> 05:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
family and hunting down the parents then
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
they would have reported it to Federal
 
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
immigration enforcement because that's
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
what these detainers are because of a
 
05:29:33.530 --> 05:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
Cooperative agreement that we would then
 
05:29:35.208 --> 05:29:35.218 align:start position:0%
we would have been in danger of being
 
05:29:36.530 --> 05:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
detained and deported because that
 
05:29:38.030 --> 05:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
information would have been used against
 
05:29:39.830 --> 05:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
us and Ice would have known where to
 
05:29:42.530 --> 05:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
find us this bill the bill sponsor
 
05:29:44.090 --> 05:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
claims that this bill would make New
 
05:29:45.530 --> 05:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire safer and that is not true
 
05:29:48.050 --> 05:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
immigrant community members know very
 
05:29:49.550 --> 05:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
clearly that even the most routine
 
05:29:51.770 --> 05:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
traffic stops even the most innocuous
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
instances where you do need police help
 
05:29:57.708 --> 05:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
puts you in that front line danger and
 
05:30:00.170 --> 05:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
like acid this bill would erode the
 
05:30:02.330 --> 05:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
trust between the community and local
 
05:30:04.610 --> 05:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
fishes local officials and service
 
05:30:07.010 --> 05:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
providers and if we want to retain a New
 
05:30:08.510 --> 05:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is truly not only
 
05:30:10.970 --> 05:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
welcoming and inclusive but is actually
 
05:30:13.730 --> 05:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
safe for all Granite Staters then I
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to say no to this bill
 
05:30:20.208 --> 05:30:20.218 align:start position:0%
thank you any any questions for
 
05:30:24.770 --> 05:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Kentucky in decade decade sorry
 
05:30:26.390 --> 05:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:30:28.970 --> 05:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative ninja putty
 
05:30:31.670 --> 05:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:30:34.128 --> 05:30:34.138 align:start position:0%
um Miss Kentucky
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
how would you describe
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
the safety in terms of the largest city
 
05:30:42.410 --> 05:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
and Manchester second largest is Nashua
 
05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of diversity how do you
 
05:30:53.270 --> 05:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
feel currently without this bill our
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
relationship or the minority
 
05:30:58.490 --> 05:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
relationships both communities are
 
05:31:01.250 --> 05:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
welcoming communities how is it with our
 
05:31:05.570 --> 05:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
police and City officials
 
05:31:07.310 --> 05:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
I would say that between the Immigrant
 
05:31:09.890 --> 05:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
and community and this and the police
 
05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
um as was illustrated by the bill that
 
05:31:15.288 --> 05:31:15.298 align:start position:0%
came up last week HB 328 in terms of
 
05:31:17.510 --> 05:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses for immigrants in the
 
05:31:19.490 --> 05:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
state that there is a lot of cooperation
 
05:31:21.650 --> 05:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
in Goodwill between immigrants in law
 
05:31:24.050 --> 05:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement for around issues that are
 
05:31:25.788 --> 05:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
about community community and Community
 
05:31:27.410 --> 05:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
safety because people want to work
 
05:31:29.628 --> 05:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
together Manchester is the largest city
 
05:31:31.250 --> 05:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but New Hampshire is
 
05:31:33.110 --> 05:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
still a very small state and after
 
05:31:35.208 --> 05:31:35.218 align:start position:0%
having lived in Boston
 
05:31:36.770 --> 05:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
um and having experienced the community
 
05:31:38.750 --> 05:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
there and experienced it here I know
 
05:31:41.448 --> 05:31:41.458 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of effort that
 
05:31:43.310 --> 05:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
Community leaders community members as
 
05:31:45.230 --> 05:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
well as law enforcement have done in
 
05:31:46.970 --> 05:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
order to build community relationships
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
together as have been very well seen
 
05:31:50.990 --> 05:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
between the relationship that um that is
 
05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
between the Nashua police and BLM Nashua
 
05:31:56.510 --> 05:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
that those those relationships have been
 
05:31:58.550 --> 05:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
ongoing and being built over a long
 
05:32:01.128 --> 05:32:01.138 align:start position:0%
period of time in a bill like this does
 
05:32:02.990 --> 05:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
nothing except really and I excuse my
 
05:32:05.390 --> 05:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
French it really takes a big dump on all
 
05:32:07.730 --> 05:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
that work in that effort and now those
 
05:32:09.230 --> 05:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
relationships that have been built up
 
05:32:11.150 --> 05:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
through Blood Sweat and a lot of
 
05:32:14.090 --> 05:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
conversation and a lot of love
 
05:32:16.490 --> 05:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:18.830 --> 05:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
but Mr chair sorry to interrupt you but

action but I actually am uh Maggie
 
05:32:45.948 --> 05:32:45.958 align:start position:0%
Fogerty from the American friend service
 
05:32:48.410 --> 05:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
committee we share a zoom account so I
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
can't sometimes control how I enter into
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
the meetings but Mr chairman and members
 
05:32:55.430 --> 05:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you so much for
 
05:32:57.650 --> 05:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I am a Dover resident I work for an
 
05:33:03.050 --> 05:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
immigrant rights organization and I am a
 
05:33:06.050 --> 05:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
member of uh Dover Friends meeting at
 
05:33:08.750 --> 05:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
Quaker Meeting which is a uh proud
 
05:33:11.690 --> 05:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary congregation and in all of
 
05:33:13.550 --> 05:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
those capacities I'm here in strong
 
05:33:17.930 --> 05:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 266 as has been said by
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
my colleague Grace kendeke this is a
 
05:33:22.970 --> 05:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
proposal that would erode the safety and
 
05:33:25.250 --> 05:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
the well-being of our communities and
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
rolls back all sorts of thoughtful work
 
05:33:29.690 --> 05:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
that's been done locally the current
 
05:33:32.090 --> 05:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
context of U.S immigration law is that
 
05:33:34.970 --> 05:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
it is convoluted it is chaotic it is
 
05:33:37.910 --> 05:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
cruel it is a collection of policy sees
 
05:33:40.550 --> 05:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
built over many many decades on the
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
exploitation of Labor and the profit
 
05:33:45.170 --> 05:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
motive of private prison companies and
 
05:33:47.570 --> 05:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
because of this millions of people in
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
the United States and many thousands in
 
05:33:51.708 --> 05:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are in limbo they have
 
05:33:54.410 --> 05:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
every desire to regularize their status
 
05:33:57.110 --> 05:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
to raise their families here and to
 
05:33:58.850 --> 05:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
remain together without fear of
 
05:34:01.550 --> 05:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
expulsion it is a desire that people
 
05:34:03.708 --> 05:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
have had as they came to New Hampshire
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
over hundreds of years it is the
 
05:34:10.310 --> 05:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
majority story here in New Hampshire and
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
Congress has failed for decades to
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
establish Humane Common Sense
 
05:34:17.150 --> 05:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
immigration policy and it is long past
 
05:34:19.788 --> 05:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
time that they do so but in the midst of
 
05:34:22.730 --> 05:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
this chaos New Hampshire communities are
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
suffering tremendously and it's
 
05:34:27.650 --> 05:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
Insidious it's the grinding stress of
 
05:34:30.288 --> 05:34:30.298 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of trying and failing to
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
sort things out of spending thousands of
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
dollars on attorneys who who can't even
 
05:34:37.070 --> 05:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
find opportunities for Relief because
 
05:34:39.890 --> 05:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
the laws are so inadequate and it's
 
05:34:42.288 --> 05:34:42.298 align:start position:0%
waiting in agony for an application to
 
05:34:44.750 --> 05:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
be approved and hoping that nothing
 
05:34:47.570 --> 05:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
disrupts the process in the meantime I
 
05:34:49.730 --> 05:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
have been visiting ice detainees at the
 
05:34:53.448 --> 05:34:53.458 align:start position:0%
Stratford County jail since 2014 and I
 
05:34:55.610 --> 05:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
have met mothers and fathers who were
 
05:34:57.890 --> 05:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
arrested for the most minor of incidents
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
or non-incidents and they've been taken
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
from their families for what for rolling
 
05:35:05.570 --> 05:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
through a stop sign for asking for
 
05:35:09.050 --> 05:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
directions for having a flat tire in the
 
05:35:11.690 --> 05:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
case of one Community for offering the
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
local police to help with interpretation
 
05:35:17.090 --> 05:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
when they arrived to a crime scene Mrs
 
05:35:18.350 --> 05:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
Fogerty I'm going to have to ask you to
 
05:35:20.930 --> 05:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
wrap as soon as you can I will thank you
 
05:35:23.510 --> 05:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm from Dover our community has figured
 
05:35:25.368 --> 05:35:25.378 align:start position:0%
out how to have a healthy balance of
 
05:35:27.850 --> 05:35:27.860 align:start position:0%
policies that allow local policing to be
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
on the side of of local realities and to
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
keep this separation so I urge you to to
 
05:35:38.570 --> 05:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
prevent this harm full proposal from
 
05:35:40.910 --> 05:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
from becoming law in New Hampshire thank
 
05:35:43.128 --> 05:35:43.138 align:start position:0%
you questions from this Fogerty
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:35:49.850 --> 05:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
you Miss Fargo your testimony and taking
 
05:35:52.730 --> 05:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
my question I would like you to just
 
05:35:55.570 --> 05:35:55.580 align:start position:0%
simply focus on the definition
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
of welcoming communities and Sanctuary
 
05:36:02.570 --> 05:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
communities are they interchangeable are
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
they too different or are they
 
05:36:09.470 --> 05:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
one and the same
 
05:36:12.050 --> 05:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh well that's an interesting question I
 
05:36:15.410 --> 05:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
mean I think that there is not really a
 
05:36:17.448 --> 05:36:17.458 align:start position:0%
precise definition of a sanctuary
 
05:36:19.150 --> 05:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
Community it is subject to
 
05:36:21.890 --> 05:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
interpretation although I know what I
 
05:36:25.310 --> 05:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
recognize as a sanctuary provision is a
 
05:36:27.770 --> 05:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
provision that says Federal immigration
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
is just that and it would erode local
 
05:36:34.190 --> 05:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
trust local safety local community
 
05:36:37.430 --> 05:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
strength if we were to conflate that
 
05:36:41.150 --> 05:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
with uh Municipal uh and local law
 
05:36:43.310 --> 05:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement and welcoming communities
 
05:36:45.770 --> 05:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
are just a matrix of ways that we say we
 
05:36:49.250 --> 05:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
celebrate diversity we want all kinds of
 
05:36:51.288 --> 05:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
folks to be able to make a home here and
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
Thrive and that we recognize our own
 
05:36:55.850 --> 05:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
history as people who
 
05:36:58.128 --> 05:36:58.138 align:start position:0%
almost always have come from somewhere
 
05:36:58.138 --> 05:37:02.628 align:start position:0%
almost always have come from somewhere
else

05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:05.810 --> 05:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh
 
05:37:09.220 --> 05:37:09.230 align:start position:0%

um
Mr

05:37:13.368 --> 05:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
Mr

oh I'm sorry to representative Tripp has
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:37:20.990 --> 05:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
05:37:24.050 --> 05:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh you said that uh
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
part of your uh duties with the friends
 
05:37:30.410 --> 05:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
is uh visiting people
 
05:37:33.470 --> 05:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh who are incarcerated in jail or
 
05:37:37.128 --> 05:37:37.138 align:start position:0%
whatever do you uh you know why they're
 
05:37:37.138 --> 05:37:39.350 align:start position:0%
whatever do you uh you know why they're
incarcerated

05:37:39.350 --> 05:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
yes so Stratford County Jail in Dover
 
05:37:45.530 --> 05:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
has a about a hundred bed contract with
 
05:37:49.368 --> 05:37:49.378 align:start position:0%
Federal immigration enforcement uh it is
 
05:37:51.410 --> 05:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
a significant stream of Revenue that
 
05:37:53.750 --> 05:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
funds County operations and the jail
 
05:37:56.030 --> 05:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
allows us to visit anyone there in ice
 
05:37:59.330 --> 05:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
custody and overwhelmingly these are
 
05:38:02.330 --> 05:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
folks with no criminal marks on their
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
records at all they are all uh they are
 
05:38:08.030 --> 05:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
primarily immigration status violations
 
05:38:10.670 --> 05:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
people whose request for Asylum have
 
05:38:13.250 --> 05:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
been denied uh people who have because
 
05:38:15.830 --> 05:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
of chance local encounters been found to
 
05:38:18.590 --> 05:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
be out of status but uh it is they are
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
people there in civil detention
 
05:38:24.590 --> 05:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
not criminal custody
 
05:38:27.470 --> 05:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for Levin thank
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks uh Ms Fogerty for
 
05:38:32.868 --> 05:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
testifying today
 
05:38:35.090 --> 05:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
um you just said it they're in civil
 
05:38:38.208 --> 05:38:38.218 align:start position:0%
detention not criminal detention and a
 
05:38:39.708 --> 05:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
few moments ago we were discussing
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
during a previous speaker's testimony
 
05:38:46.190 --> 05:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
that 48 Hours was the longest that
 
05:38:49.010 --> 05:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh person can be detained so I'm
 
05:38:51.650 --> 05:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
confused can you clarify for me
 
05:38:54.350 --> 05:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
yes people speaking after me can speak
 
05:38:56.628 --> 05:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
more precisely to what a detainer
 
05:38:58.310 --> 05:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
request is and what law enforcement can
 
05:39:00.230 --> 05:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
do but I will say there are immigrants
 
05:39:04.190 --> 05:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
in detention for years who are just
 
05:39:07.850 --> 05:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
stuck in a process that offers them no
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
way out even to deportation it is it's
 
05:39:13.550 --> 05:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
horrible and it's hidden so no detention
 
05:39:15.530 --> 05:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
immigration detention can be very very
 
05:39:15.540 --> 05:39:16.970 align:start position:0%
immigration detention can be very very
long

05:39:16.970 --> 05:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
long
 
05:39:19.490 --> 05:39:19.500 align:start position:0%

if anyone has questions I can take those
 
05:40:01.550 --> 05:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
but I would also add that I would defer
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the ACLU and others who are better
 
05:40:05.628 --> 05:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
versed in this particular area of law to
 
05:40:07.970 --> 05:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
answer technical questions I've heard a
 
05:40:09.470 --> 05:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
number of technical questions here that
 
05:40:11.930 --> 05:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
I just uh I'm not that familiar with the
 
05:40:14.530 --> 05:40:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
you had a question
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr Grace for taking my
 
05:40:22.550 --> 05:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
question the opposition is you will
 
05:40:24.530 --> 05:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
represent the municipal Association
 
05:40:28.070 --> 05:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct a position is is
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
it due to the cost it adds to the local
 
05:40:35.150 --> 05:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities or is it just uh
 
05:40:39.170 --> 05:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
communities and the workforce what is
 
05:40:41.930 --> 05:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
the point of what is the highlight of
 
05:40:43.610 --> 05:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
the opposition
 
05:40:46.550 --> 05:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
so we we identified a number of areas in
 
05:40:50.090 --> 05:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
the bill that we had concerns with
 
05:40:53.030 --> 05:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
one being that uh the bill
 
05:40:55.368 --> 05:40:55.378 align:start position:0%
prohibits municipality for enforcing a
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
policy or taking another action in
 
05:40:59.570 --> 05:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
violation of of federal law but of
 
05:41:01.190 --> 05:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
course municipalities already have to
 
05:41:03.288 --> 05:41:03.298 align:start position:0%
comply with federal law so there's no
 
05:41:08.330 --> 05:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:09.890 --> 05:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
it also
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
um further prohibits municipalities from
 
05:41:14.868 --> 05:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
adopting any policy that restricts or
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
discourages inquiring about the
 
05:41:18.650 --> 05:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
immigration status of any individual
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
when we spoke with police Chiefs across
 
05:41:24.050 --> 05:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
the state they emphasized that the
 
05:41:25.970 --> 05:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities are safer when residents
 
05:41:27.470 --> 05:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
are comfortable reporting crimes and
 
05:41:29.090 --> 05:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
otherwise cooperating
 
05:41:31.250 --> 05:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
and there was concern as as we've
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
already heard here today about how the
 
05:41:35.810 --> 05:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
police and citizen interaction will
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
occur and local authorities are better
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
positioned to determine what's best for
 
05:41:42.530 --> 05:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
their own cities and towns and that's
 
05:41:45.410 --> 05:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
really kind of the emphasis that we want
 
05:41:47.208 --> 05:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
to emphasize even though our letter
 
05:41:49.910 --> 05:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't outline every concern that we
 
05:41:53.628 --> 05:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
have it just seems that the decisions
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
the local level
 
05:41:58.190 --> 05:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
make more sense because local officials
 
05:42:00.708 --> 05:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
know who their citizens are and they're
 
05:42:04.430 --> 05:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
able to talk with them more effectively
 
05:42:04.440 --> 05:42:05.448 align:start position:0%
able to talk with them more effectively
um

05:42:05.448 --> 05:42:05.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:08.510 --> 05:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
then and does we don't need this uh
 
05:42:12.590 --> 05:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
a representative Gallagher you have
 
05:42:20.570 --> 05:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
yes um one of the principles that the
 
05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
municipal Association often
 
05:42:25.730 --> 05:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
um cites
 
05:42:25.740 --> 05:42:27.110 align:start position:0%
um cites
when

05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:42:29.030 --> 05:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
um choosing to support or oppose
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is that of local control
 
05:42:35.690 --> 05:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
um could you go a bit more into depth
 
05:42:38.868 --> 05:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
about how the principle of local control
 
05:42:41.930 --> 05:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
comes into play here
 
05:42:44.270 --> 05:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
05:42:44.280 --> 05:42:45.170 align:start position:0%
sure so
um

05:42:45.170 --> 05:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:49.368 --> 05:42:49.378 align:start position:0%
a ice detainer request is a request it's
 
05:42:52.128 --> 05:42:52.138 align:start position:0%
not a document with the force of law
 
05:42:53.810 --> 05:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
federal law doesn't require the local
 
05:42:56.030 --> 05:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
authorities hold anyone based on the
 
05:42:57.190 --> 05:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
request alone
 
05:42:59.868 --> 05:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
and I would certainly defer to the ACLU
 
05:43:02.470 --> 05:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
for for a further explanation of that
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that
 
05:43:06.120 --> 05:43:06.948 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that
um

05:43:06.948 --> 05:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:10.788 --> 05:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
when state law here would require local
 
05:43:12.410 --> 05:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
police departments to fully comply with
 
05:43:14.810 --> 05:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
ice detainer requests as well as any
 
05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
other legal document provided by a
 
05:43:18.050 --> 05:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
federal agency
 
05:43:20.090 --> 05:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be clear exactly what
 
05:43:22.430 --> 05:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
municipality should be doing and there's
 
05:43:25.788 --> 05:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
possibility as we've heard here that
 
05:43:27.530 --> 05:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
municipalities would inadvertently
 
05:43:29.150 --> 05:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
violate individuals constitutional
 
05:43:31.250 --> 05:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
rights by attempting to interpret this
 
05:43:32.810 --> 05:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
this phrase which
 
05:43:35.868 --> 05:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
we're not entirely sure what it means
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:43:41.150 --> 05:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense that at the local
 
05:43:41.160 --> 05:43:42.350 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense that at the local
level

05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
you know the the local police uh and the
 
05:43:48.048 --> 05:43:48.058 align:start position:0%
local officials working with their local
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
communities make determinations about
 
05:43:53.270 --> 05:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
what kind of local policies they have
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
and they want to have to determine what
 
05:43:59.930 --> 05:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
they should do in these difficult cases
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and next we'd like to go to uh
 
05:44:06.110 --> 05:44:06.120 align:start position:0%

searching again I just searched him
 
05:44:28.128 --> 05:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
earlier and I could not find out
 
05:44:30.470 --> 05:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
another one that signed up to speak is
 
05:44:32.628 --> 05:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
Bruno Soros
 
05:44:40.070 --> 05:44:40.080 align:start position:0%

05:45:39.708 --> 05:45:39.718 align:start position:0%

05:45:48.650 --> 05:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
asthma al-huny
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
who's a lobbyist from Lebanon she would
 
05:45:54.010 --> 05:45:54.020 align:start position:0%
like to speak

in opposition to the bill
 
05:45:59.090 --> 05:45:59.100 align:start position:0%

human rights and I'm really not
 
05:46:15.770 --> 05:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
understanding why a hate group gets all
 
05:46:17.330 --> 05:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
these minutes and then you want to limit
 
05:46:20.208 --> 05:46:20.218 align:start position:0%

proud Muslim woman who wears hijab and

I'm also an immigrant and I'm really
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
upset about this bill for several
 
05:47:25.070 --> 05:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
reasons I'm very familiar with the way
 
05:47:27.170 --> 05:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
immigrants are racially profiled and

as I said the immigrants in our
 
05:49:24.830 --> 05:49:24.840 align:start position:0%

05:49:28.010 --> 05:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
000 undocumented community members New
 
05:49:30.110 --> 05:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rights Granite Staters who
 
05:49:32.270 --> 05:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
live in our community deserve the
 
05:49:34.430 --> 05:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
benefit of the doubt they are our
 
05:49:36.288 --> 05:49:36.298 align:start position:0%
laborers they're our friends they are
 
05:49:38.390 --> 05:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
family members and we want to benefit
 
05:49:40.490 --> 05:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
from their labor but we don't want to
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
offer them the basic human rights of
 
05:49:44.930 --> 05:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
being treated like human beings and I
 
05:49:46.430 --> 05:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
want to also state that most people that
 
05:49:49.070 --> 05:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
are undocumented came here legally and
 
05:49:51.048 --> 05:49:51.058 align:start position:0%
the only reason why they don't have
 
05:49:52.910 --> 05:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
documentation is because of language
 
05:49:55.128 --> 05:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
barriers and it's difficult for them to
 
05:49:57.230 --> 05:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
renew their visas for most people right
 
05:49:59.208 --> 05:49:59.218 align:start position:0%
according to the American economy
 
05:50:02.230 --> 05:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants paid
 
05:50:06.250 --> 05:50:06.260 align:start position:0%
77.1 million dollars in taxes that's
 
05:50:09.830 --> 05:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
18.6 million dollars in state taxes and
 
05:50:12.890 --> 05:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
that's 58.4 million dollars in federal
 
05:50:15.770 --> 05:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
taxes I live in Lebanon and in Lebanon
 
05:50:17.570 --> 05:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
and in Hanover we have something called
 
05:50:19.430 --> 05:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
the welcoming ordinances that immigrants
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
are incredibly grateful for and they
 
05:50:24.230 --> 05:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
tell me thank you so much for passing
 
05:50:26.270 --> 05:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
this ordinance because we were worried
 
05:50:28.610 --> 05:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
that police officers may stop us and
 
05:50:29.930 --> 05:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
then call Immigration Customs
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
Enforcement and then have us deported so
 
05:50:34.610 --> 05:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
this is a way to tell immigrants that
 
05:50:37.490 --> 05:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
this is an inclusive in uh Community for
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
everyone and also I also want to stay
 
05:50:41.810 --> 05:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
according to the Poverty Law Center
 
05:50:44.270 --> 05:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
numerous quirks have found that cities
 
05:50:46.010 --> 05:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
and counties that comply with ice
 
05:50:48.590 --> 05:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
detainer requests in the absence of a
 
05:50:50.030 --> 05:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
Judicial warrant
 
05:50:52.250 --> 05:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
are violating a person's Fourth
 
05:50:54.048 --> 05:50:54.058 align:start position:0%
Amendment right against unreasonable
 
05:50:56.390 --> 05:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
search and seizures and have required
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
those governments to pay damages to
 
05:51:00.708 --> 05:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
those people they held in jail as a
 
05:51:02.510 --> 05:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
result of detainers I can also offer you
 
05:51:04.490 --> 05:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
that information law enforcement should
 
05:51:06.170 --> 05:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
not be in the business of enforcing
 
05:51:08.570 --> 05:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
civil immigration that's really a waste
 
05:51:10.910 --> 05:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
of tax dollars and for this sake we
 
05:51:12.770 --> 05:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
should and for the humanity of these
 
05:51:14.810 --> 05:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
people we should vote to itl this bill
 
05:51:14.820 --> 05:51:16.190 align:start position:0%
people we should vote to itl this bill
immediately

05:51:16.190 --> 05:51:16.200 align:start position:0%

taking my testimony my name is Eva
 
05:51:55.990 --> 05:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
Castillo I'm a resident of Manchester
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
and uh I am the director of the New
 
05:52:01.250 --> 05:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Alliance for immigrants and
 
05:52:03.770 --> 05:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
refugees I advocate for the rights of
 
05:52:06.770 --> 05:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
immigrants in New Hampshire for over 20
 
05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
years I have had countless meetings with
 
05:52:11.628 --> 05:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
different police departments all over
 
05:52:14.810 --> 05:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
the state in fact I am a police
 
05:52:17.930 --> 05:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner in Manchester uh I started
 
05:52:21.230 --> 05:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
in 2011 and and I served for six years
 
05:52:24.910 --> 05:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
and I just came back after my mandatory
 
05:52:28.368 --> 05:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
retirement uh because I do believe in
 
05:52:31.548 --> 05:52:31.558 align:start position:0%
building uh trust and in building good
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
relationships based on uh on respect
 
05:52:38.150 --> 05:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
mutual respect and understanding and I
 
05:52:41.150 --> 05:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I see that many immigrants mistrust
 
05:52:44.270 --> 05:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
the police and I also spend a lot of
 
05:52:46.070 --> 05:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
time talking to police departments all
 
05:52:47.868 --> 05:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
over the a place about cultural
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
diversity and immigrant attitudes and
 
05:52:54.770 --> 05:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
immigration inside so I am speaking
 
05:52:57.530 --> 05:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
both as an advocate for immigrants but
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
also as a person that has strong ties to
 
05:53:02.390 --> 05:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
different police departments this bill
 
05:53:06.350 --> 05:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
is totally wrong I know for a fact that
 
05:53:08.270 --> 05:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
so many police departments have spent
 
05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
countless times and a money and effort
 
05:53:13.850 --> 05:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
to build relationships because they
 
05:53:18.530 --> 05:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
recognized that uh when everybody feels
 
05:53:21.770 --> 05:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
safe and accepted our community as a
 
05:53:25.368 --> 05:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
whole is safer for everybody so this
 
05:53:27.170 --> 05:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
bill would undermine all those
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
relationships of trust that they have
 
05:53:31.850 --> 05:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
spent so much time uh so much time
 
05:53:34.490 --> 05:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
building and when when they become
 
05:53:36.470 --> 05:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
entangled in Immigration enforcement
 
05:53:39.048 --> 05:53:39.058 align:start position:0%
that's going to hamper all public safety
 
05:53:41.390 --> 05:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
for all of us ultimately is the
 
05:53:43.610 --> 05:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
responsibility of federal immigration
 
05:53:45.650 --> 05:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
authorities to enforce federal law
 
05:53:47.930 --> 05:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
police departments are here to enforce
 
05:53:50.470 --> 05:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
criminal law
 
05:53:54.170 --> 05:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh the lady that spoke from Fair did not
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
get the memo that DHS got forbidden the
 
05:54:01.548 --> 05:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
use of alien uh now they're supposed to
 
05:54:02.530 --> 05:54:02.540 align:start position:0%
be called
 
05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
non-citizens uh thanks to the Biden
 
05:54:08.690 --> 05:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
Administration so people are to be
 
05:54:11.510 --> 05:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
called from now on non-citizens
 
05:54:11.520 --> 05:54:13.548 align:start position:0%
called from now on non-citizens
um

05:54:13.548 --> 05:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:16.850 --> 05:54:16.860 align:start position:0%
so please you know I get a stomachache
 
05:54:20.930 --> 05:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
every time I I hear the I the I word
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know so this is this build really
 
05:54:27.530 --> 05:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
makes no sense whatsoever no Sanctuary

thank you for taking my question
 
05:56:24.110 --> 05:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
during the Obama Administration the
 
05:56:26.230 --> 05:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security
 
05:56:30.670 --> 05:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
said that anything over 1 000
 
05:56:33.890 --> 05:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
unaccompanied minors per day on the
 
05:56:36.530 --> 05:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
southern border would be a crisis
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
today there are over 4 000 unaccompanied
 
05:56:45.288 --> 05:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
minors per day crossing the border would
 
05:56:47.150 --> 05:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
you say that's a crisis
 
05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know what I heard before to
 
05:56:51.708 --> 05:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
instruct not to talk about immigration
 
05:56:54.650 --> 05:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
we're talking about police and immigrant
 
05:56:56.810 --> 05:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
relations we're talking about an issue
 
05:56:59.090 --> 05:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have anything to do with
 
05:57:02.330 --> 05:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
the border with people immigrating here
 
05:57:05.570 --> 05:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
so respectfully I really don't see the
 
05:57:07.970 --> 05:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
relevance of this question
 
05:57:10.368 --> 05:57:10.378 align:start position:0%

05:57:13.010 --> 05:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh
 
05:57:16.430 --> 05:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
I believe I heard you say that uh
 
05:57:19.250 --> 05:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
the federal uh
 
05:57:22.910 --> 05:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh enforces should enforce federal laws
 
05:57:25.670 --> 05:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
and uh the state should have nothing to
 
05:57:27.410 --> 05:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
do with enforcing federal laws is that
 
05:57:30.470 --> 05:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
correct that's right it's not their job
 
05:57:32.510 --> 05:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
so you have a follow-up I have a
 
05:57:37.310 --> 05:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up so uh uh you you would uh say
 
05:57:39.770 --> 05:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:57:42.310 --> 05:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
people that are and not necessarily
 
05:57:47.030 --> 05:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
non-citizens uh that are uh
 
05:57:50.208 --> 05:57:50.218 align:start position:0%
breaking Federal narcotic laws it's not
 
05:57:51.548 --> 05:57:51.558 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
05:57:55.070 --> 05:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
state's issue to enforce those laws no
 
05:57:56.570 --> 05:57:56.580 align:start position:0%

06:02:46.310 --> 06:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
we're here in opposition to HB 266. I
 
06:02:47.930 --> 06:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
know I have limited time and I know the
 
06:02:50.208 --> 06:02:50.218 align:start position:0%
committee's gone on for a while today so
 
06:02:52.970 --> 06:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
I just want to make uh three points and
 
06:02:56.690 --> 06:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
the first is uh out the outset just
 
06:02:59.208 --> 06:02:59.218 align:start position:0%
having heard earlier testimony today
 
06:03:01.430 --> 06:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
particularly from one advocacy group
 
06:03:04.250 --> 06:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill I fear that this
 
06:03:07.548 --> 06:03:07.558 align:start position:0%
bill really may be premised on the in
 
06:03:10.368 --> 06:03:10.378 align:start position:0%
generalization that undocumented
 
06:03:13.128 --> 06:03:13.138 align:start position:0%
individuals are criminals and it's not
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
true and I really would caution against
 
06:03:17.868 --> 06:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
this type of generalization having
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
represented many immigrants and their
 
06:03:21.948 --> 06:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
families in my work I can tell you that
 
06:03:25.368 --> 06:03:25.378 align:start position:0%
they're like us flaws and all like all
 
06:03:27.470 --> 06:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
of us a small number of committed crimes
 
06:03:30.110 --> 06:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
the vast majority have it like all of us
 
06:03:32.330 --> 06:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
they're doing you know the best they can
 
06:03:35.150 --> 06:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
do to to live and survive in these
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
uncertain times they're just as
 
06:03:39.470 --> 06:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
complicated and unique as we are and
 
06:03:40.850 --> 06:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
there's just more difference we have
 
06:03:43.250 --> 06:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
status they don't but they're part of
 
06:03:46.128 --> 06:03:46.138 align:start position:0%
our communities nonetheless I do want to
 
06:03:47.868 --> 06:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
make two additional points and the first
 
06:03:50.030 --> 06:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
is that uh and this has been mentioned a
 
06:03:52.190 --> 06:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
little bit before is that this bill
 
06:03:55.368 --> 06:03:55.378 align:start position:0%
would uh Force municipalities to violate
 
06:03:58.250 --> 06:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
the fourth and 14th amendments and would
 
06:04:00.830 --> 06:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
subject uh local law enforcement to
 
06:04:04.010 --> 06:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
liability for those violations uh what
 
06:04:06.590 --> 06:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
do I mean by that what I mean is that
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would create serious
 
06:04:11.090 --> 06:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
constitutional concerns in practice by
 
06:04:13.990 --> 06:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
requiring state and local police to
 
06:04:17.390 --> 06:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
honor immigration detainers and and so
 
06:04:21.048 --> 06:04:21.058 align:start position:0%
doing hold uh civil immigration
 
06:04:24.170 --> 06:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
detainees for ice and that's really
 
06:04:25.850 --> 06:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
problem dramatic because immigration
 
06:04:27.650 --> 06:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
detainers aren't arrest warrants and
 
06:04:29.810 --> 06:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
there's some testimony earlier about
 
06:04:31.850 --> 06:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
this unlike criminal warrants which are
 
06:04:34.490 --> 06:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
supported by a determination of probable
 
06:04:36.948 --> 06:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
cause ice detainers are just issued by
 
06:04:38.510 --> 06:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
Ice enforcement agents themselves
 
06:04:41.510 --> 06:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
without any type of judicial oversight
 
06:04:43.970 --> 06:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
and that's really critical and why this
 
06:04:45.410 --> 06:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
creates a Fourth Amendment violation
 
06:04:47.868 --> 06:04:47.878 align:start position:0%
because if a person is held pursuant to
 
06:04:49.368 --> 06:04:49.378 align:start position:0%
that detainer they haven't been held
 
06:04:51.650 --> 06:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
pursuant to a warrant where a judge has
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
found probable cause and premise within
 
06:04:55.850 --> 06:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
that of course is the fact that was
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned before that being undocumented
 
06:05:02.690 --> 06:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh by itself is not a crime and so
 
06:05:05.090 --> 06:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
because it's not a crime any type of
 
06:05:07.250 --> 06:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
civil detainer doesn't provide a
 
06:05:09.708 --> 06:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
predicate for local law enforcement to
 
06:05:11.330 --> 06:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
hold someone so if local police does
 
06:05:13.730 --> 06:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
hold someone pursuant to a detainer as
 
06:05:15.530 --> 06:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
they would essentially be required to do
 
06:05:18.170 --> 06:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
under this bill that municipality is
 
06:05:19.548 --> 06:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
really going to be subject to
 
06:05:22.490 --> 06:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
significant uh exposure potential
 
06:05:22.500 --> 06:05:23.690 align:start position:0%
significant uh exposure potential
litigations

06:05:23.690 --> 06:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
litigations
 
06:05:25.910 --> 06:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
the second point I want to make and also
 
06:05:27.470 --> 06:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
it was one that was made before but I
 
06:05:29.448 --> 06:05:29.458 align:start position:0%
think it's really important from my
 
06:05:32.030 --> 06:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
perspective is that I think this bill
 
06:05:34.788 --> 06:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
would undermine Community Trust in law
 
06:05:37.670 --> 06:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement if enacted when local police
 
06:05:39.948 --> 06:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
departments detain individuals simply
 
06:05:42.350 --> 06:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
due to their undocumented status I fear
 
06:05:43.368 --> 06:05:43.378 align:start position:0%
that they're going to create an
 
06:05:46.670 --> 06:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
environment where you know victims these
 
06:05:48.470 --> 06:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
individuals uh you know are going to be
 
06:05:50.810 --> 06:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
afraid to call the police for help and
 
06:05:52.368 --> 06:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
you know this isn't hypothetical it's
 
06:05:55.010 --> 06:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
real we had an example of this out of
 
06:05:56.930 --> 06:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
Exeter where undocumented person
 
06:05:59.990 --> 06:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
provided translation services
 
06:06:02.030 --> 06:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
um a department was uh police that
 
06:06:04.430 --> 06:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
Police Department was interviewing a
 
06:06:07.010 --> 06:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
potential suspect and following that
 
06:06:08.750 --> 06:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
interview the department turned their
 
06:06:10.310 --> 06:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
attention to that undocumented
 
06:06:12.288 --> 06:06:12.298 align:start position:0%
individual who was providing translation
 
06:06:15.048 --> 06:06:15.058 align:start position:0%
services and held him uh for ice and
 
06:06:16.970 --> 06:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
that is exactly the problem with this
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
type of Bill that if you are
 
06:06:20.628 --> 06:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
undocumented you are not going to go to
 
06:06:22.548 --> 06:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
your local police department
 
06:06:22.558 --> 06:06:23.628 align:start position:0%
your local police department
um

06:06:23.628 --> 06:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
to ask you to rap yep that was thank you
 
06:06:27.650 --> 06:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that was actually the last
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
point I was going to make I was just
 
06:06:31.730 --> 06:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
finishing up uh but that that's the fear
 
06:06:34.490 --> 06:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
of undermining uh Community Trust in law
 
06:06:35.570 --> 06:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement and with that I'd be happy
 
06:06:36.890 --> 06:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
to take questions I'm sorry for running
 
06:06:39.048 --> 06:06:39.058 align:start position:0%
over Mr chairman that's all right uh
 
06:06:40.690 --> 06:06:40.700 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman you had a question
 
06:06:43.368 --> 06:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
06:06:46.610 --> 06:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
Bissonnet for taking my question uh for
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I am a select woman uh
 
06:06:51.830 --> 06:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the town of Exeter and I once when
 
06:06:54.530 --> 06:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
this incident occurred uh so I'm pretty
 
06:06:56.448 --> 06:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
familiar with it but my question is
 
06:06:56.458 --> 06:06:57.830 align:start position:0%
familiar with it but my question is
actually

06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:07:02.390 --> 06:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
um on what's cited in this bill is eight
 
06:07:04.390 --> 06:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
USC section
 
06:07:06.530 --> 06:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
11357 g
 
06:07:08.510 --> 06:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
and under that
 
06:07:10.910 --> 06:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
it reads
 
06:07:13.010 --> 06:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
that in performing the function under
 
06:07:15.890 --> 06:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
this subsection an officer or employee
 
06:07:17.948 --> 06:07:17.958 align:start position:0%
of the state or political subdivision
 
06:07:21.610 --> 06:07:21.620 align:start position:0%
may use federal no wrong one
 
06:07:24.048 --> 06:07:24.058 align:start position:0%
is subject to the direction and
 
06:07:26.330 --> 06:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
supervision of the Attorney General
 
06:07:29.930 --> 06:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
so does that mean the patrol officers in
 
06:07:32.990 --> 06:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
my town or any town have two bosses but
 
06:07:35.208 --> 06:07:35.218 align:start position:0%
only one pays them
 
06:07:37.548 --> 06:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
well I think I'm pulling up that
 
06:07:39.288 --> 06:07:39.298 align:start position:0%
language now I think under this bill
 
06:07:41.948 --> 06:07:41.958 align:start position:0%
that's really the concern right is that
 
06:07:44.510 --> 06:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
essentially local police could be
 
06:07:47.570 --> 06:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
commandeered uh by ice now whenever I
 
06:07:49.548 --> 06:07:49.558 align:start position:0%
submits a detainer now that department
 
06:07:53.330 --> 06:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
has to use its Authority and resources
 
06:07:57.530 --> 06:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
to uh to ultimately detain that person
 
06:07:58.970 --> 06:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
um you know that provision that you're
 
06:08:00.890 --> 06:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
referencing of that Federal code I think
 
06:08:04.490 --> 06:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's called 287g if I'm not mistaken it
 
06:08:06.410 --> 06:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
has to do with formal agreements that
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
some municipalities will make with ice
 
06:08:10.788 --> 06:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
where those local municipalities can
 
06:08:13.610 --> 06:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
effectively act as ice agents the
 
06:08:15.590 --> 06:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
concern I have with this bill is that it
 
06:08:17.448 --> 06:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
almost requires that and how right if
 
06:08:19.610 --> 06:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
you're a local police uh if this bill's
 
06:08:19.620 --> 06:08:20.930 align:start position:0%
you're a local police uh if this bill's
enacted

06:08:20.930 --> 06:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:08:25.670 --> 06:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative Amanda Putin thank you Mr
 
06:08:29.770 --> 06:08:29.780 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr assessment for uh
 
06:08:33.048 --> 06:08:33.058 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
um did I hear you say that you in your
 
06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
legal work or you work with the
 
06:08:38.160 --> 06:08:39.310 align:start position:0%
legal work or you work with the
immigrants

06:08:39.310 --> 06:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
06:08:42.708 --> 06:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
would you be able to define or send some
 
06:08:47.770 --> 06:08:47.780 align:start position:0%
definitions of legal illegal status list
 
06:08:51.170 --> 06:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
undocumented what is the definition of
 
06:08:53.510 --> 06:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
all these categories that are mentioned
 
06:08:56.208 --> 06:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
so freely in this bill yeah I mean there
 
06:08:58.190 --> 06:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
there is uh
 
06:09:00.350 --> 06:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
legal definitions and then they're kind
 
06:09:02.930 --> 06:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
of colloquial terms that we're kind of
 
06:09:05.570 --> 06:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
using in this discussion today uh and
 
06:09:07.250 --> 06:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to be clear when I when
 
06:09:09.170 --> 06:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
I use the term undocumented or without
 
06:09:11.868 --> 06:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
status really what I'm just referring to
 
06:09:14.390 --> 06:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
is an individual who doesn't have lawful
 
06:09:16.430 --> 06:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
authority to be in the United States
 
06:09:17.990 --> 06:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean again that they've
 
06:09:19.610 --> 06:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
committed a crime that is a
 
06:09:22.250 --> 06:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different thing being in
 
06:09:23.868 --> 06:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
the United States without status is
 
06:09:28.190 --> 06:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
merely a civil violation by itself I'm
 
06:09:30.170 --> 06:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
happy to provide kind of a glossary of
 
06:09:32.208 --> 06:09:32.218 align:start position:0%
terms that would be more technical in
 
06:09:34.850 --> 06:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
nature but I'm trying to frankly avoid
 
06:09:37.070 --> 06:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
legalese as much as I possibly can at
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
risk of confusing and muddying things up
 
06:09:42.230 --> 06:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair just a quick follow-up
 
06:09:45.530 --> 06:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
please go ahead so uh what you're saying
 
06:09:49.128 --> 06:09:49.138 align:start position:0%
is is it undocumented or illegal is this
 
06:09:51.708 --> 06:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
a static situation or are these
 
06:09:55.850 --> 06:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
instances where uh some status could be
 
06:10:00.770 --> 06:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:03.170 --> 06:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
um a student and I'm transitioning I
 
06:10:05.530 --> 06:10:05.540 align:start position:0%
could be undocumented
 
06:10:08.810 --> 06:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
or a status list for a period of time
 
06:10:12.350 --> 06:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
does that make a criminal offense it
 
06:10:13.910 --> 06:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't and I I see your point now I'm
 
06:10:15.530 --> 06:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
sorry I understand the question you're
 
06:10:18.590 --> 06:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
right status can change for example
 
06:10:21.350 --> 06:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
um you know a Visa overstay right you
 
06:10:22.910 --> 06:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
know you have a set period of time in
 
06:10:25.128 --> 06:10:25.138 align:start position:0%
which an individual is allowed to be in
 
06:10:26.930 --> 06:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
the country lawfully and at a certain
 
06:10:29.930 --> 06:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
date if that person remains that person
 
06:10:32.390 --> 06:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
is now here unlawfully and that is a
 
06:10:35.930 --> 06:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
civil violation not a criminal violation
 
06:10:37.970 --> 06:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
um so so you're right obviously status
 
06:10:41.030 --> 06:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
is fluid and can change based on dates
 
06:10:43.490 --> 06:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
whether a predicate criminal offense has
 
06:10:47.750 --> 06:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:50.090 --> 06:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
06:10:52.558 --> 06:10:54.350 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr
question

06:10:54.350 --> 06:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:10:54.360 --> 06:10:55.190 align:start position:0%
question
um

06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:58.368 --> 06:10:58.378 align:start position:0%
I'd like to to ask your legal opinion
 
06:11:01.128 --> 06:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
about the perhaps unintended
 
06:11:03.948 --> 06:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
consequences of the talk about welcoming
 
06:11:07.270 --> 06:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
ordinances and confusing those with
 
06:11:11.570 --> 06:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary cities and alleging that they
 
06:11:14.030 --> 06:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
hide under the guise of welcoming
 
06:11:16.490 --> 06:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
ordinances etc etc
 
06:11:19.930 --> 06:11:19.940 align:start position:0%
do you see any First Amendment issues
 
06:11:24.590 --> 06:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
arising this bill become law where a
 
06:11:27.288 --> 06:11:27.298 align:start position:0%
city or a town let's say decides to pass
 
06:11:30.708 --> 06:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
an ordinance's welcoming
 
06:11:33.650 --> 06:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
people from Moldova to their
 
06:11:33.660 --> 06:11:35.990 align:start position:0%
people from Moldova to their
municipality

06:11:35.990 --> 06:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
06:11:37.368 --> 06:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know if it's a First
 
06:11:38.810 --> 06:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment issue but I can tell you that
 
06:11:40.490 --> 06:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
the government of course can engage in
 
06:11:42.770 --> 06:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
any type of speech it wants to just like
 
06:11:45.650 --> 06:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
individual citizens can so I don't think
 
06:11:48.250 --> 06:11:48.260 align:start position:0%
there's anything appropriate about
 
06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
proclamations that just as a value
 
06:11:54.410 --> 06:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
statement right a city or town is saying
 
06:11:55.730 --> 06:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
that they're welcoming a particular
 
06:11:57.770 --> 06:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
group of people I know that some cities
 
06:12:00.048 --> 06:12:00.058 align:start position:0%
and towns have been concerned about
 
06:12:02.690 --> 06:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
requirements concerning detainers or
 
06:12:05.510 --> 06:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
complying with detainers for the same
 
06:12:07.490 --> 06:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
reason that you for Testimony today is
 
06:12:09.590 --> 06:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
that they worry about liability given
 
06:12:13.910 --> 06:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that being undocumented uh is
 
06:12:17.150 --> 06:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
by itself not a crime so I mean I think
 
06:12:18.530 --> 06:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
there to some extent
 
06:12:20.930 --> 06:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
two different concepts Sanctuary versus
 
06:12:23.030 --> 06:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
welcoming I don't even really know what
 
06:12:25.010 --> 06:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
the term Sanctuary means to be honest
 
06:12:27.470 --> 06:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of this term that's thrown out
 
06:12:29.030 --> 06:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
there uh you know what I'm principally
 
06:12:31.910 --> 06:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
focused on in my advocacy is work around
 
06:12:35.090 --> 06:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
detainers and just trying to educate the
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
public that uh detainers are just not
 
06:12:39.288 --> 06:12:39.298 align:start position:0%
warrants they're not like arrest
 
06:12:41.208 --> 06:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
warrants they are fundamentally
 
06:12:43.610 --> 06:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
different and as a result really just
 
06:12:47.750 --> 06:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
can't form a basis for a detention
 
06:12:49.850 --> 06:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
by a local official
 
06:12:51.530 --> 06:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:12:53.448 --> 06:12:53.458 align:start position:0%
thank you and for those on the committee
 
06:12:55.730 --> 06:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
if you just uh
 
06:12:59.208 --> 06:12:59.218 align:start position:0%
indulge me for a minute we are
 
06:13:01.430 --> 06:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
quickly running out of time to get our
 
06:13:03.288 --> 06:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
business done today which needs to get
 
06:13:05.930 --> 06:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
done and we are approaching three
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
o'clock I like the target three o'clock
 
06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
to finish this here and so if you keep
 
06:13:12.350 --> 06:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
that in mind with your number of
 
06:13:14.150 --> 06:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions that you have and for those
 
06:13:15.830 --> 06:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
that still want to testify with the
 
06:13:18.288 --> 06:13:18.298 align:start position:0%
amount of time you need to keep that in
 
06:13:20.270 --> 06:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
mind uh
 
06:13:21.948 --> 06:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore you had another
 
06:13:24.350 --> 06:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair and
 
06:13:25.970 --> 06:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Beason for taking my
 
06:13:28.970 --> 06:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
question in your ex in your opinion if
 
06:13:31.850 --> 06:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
this bill becomes law
 
06:13:34.610 --> 06:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
are we going to have our local law
 
06:13:36.830 --> 06:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials going to have an
 
06:13:38.628 --> 06:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
issue with the power granted to them
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:46.788 --> 06:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
well I think my position is if this
 
06:13:48.948 --> 06:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
becomes law
 
06:13:51.048 --> 06:13:51.058 align:start position:0%
they're going they they potentially
 
06:13:54.470 --> 06:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
could be forced to hold people for ice
 
06:13:54.480 --> 06:13:56.030 align:start position:0%
could be forced to hold people for ice
without

06:13:56.030 --> 06:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
without
 
06:13:58.610 --> 06:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
inadequate finding a probable cause that
 
06:14:00.170 --> 06:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
a crime has been committed and I can
 
06:14:01.690 --> 06:14:01.700 align:start position:0%
tell you though you know though I'm
 
06:14:03.948 --> 06:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes on the opposite sides of
 
06:14:06.170 --> 06:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
municipalities here I'm very sympathetic
 
06:14:09.048 --> 06:14:09.058 align:start position:0%
to the concern they have because
 
06:14:11.690 --> 06:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
I think they're likely to get sued you
 
06:14:11.700 --> 06:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
I think they're likely to get sued you
know

06:14:12.470 --> 06:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:14:14.810 --> 06:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
um you know as a result
 
06:14:17.390 --> 06:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lasalles had a
 
06:14:20.510 --> 06:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
question yes uh Mr Bissonnet thank you
 
06:14:22.250 --> 06:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
for taking my question very simple
 
06:14:25.788 --> 06:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
question and I'm I am too am confused
 
06:14:29.448 --> 06:14:29.458 align:start position:0%
about the legalities of this
 
06:14:33.708 --> 06:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
a person who is undocumented
 
06:14:38.208 --> 06:14:38.218 align:start position:0%
who enters the United States illegally
 
06:14:40.910 --> 06:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
have they broken the law
 
06:14:43.670 --> 06:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
so uh it really depends on the situation
 
06:14:46.970 --> 06:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
so if an individual has crossed the
 
06:14:49.970 --> 06:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
border and say they're then detained at
 
06:14:52.128 --> 06:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
the border they may have committed a
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
crime but there are other categories of
 
06:14:56.090 --> 06:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
undocumented individuals for example
 
06:14:57.890 --> 06:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
like Visa overstays like I was
 
06:15:00.410 --> 06:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
referencing oh and I understand it yeah
 
06:15:03.288 --> 06:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
I understand the legal entry is uh a
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
legal entry or a legal re-entry is a
 
06:15:08.330 --> 06:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
federal criminal offense yes okay thank
 
06:15:10.010 --> 06:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
06:15:13.788 --> 06:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
uh and next I'd like to uh
 
06:15:17.570 --> 06:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
go to representative McDonald question
 
06:15:19.730 --> 06:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:15:22.070 --> 06:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you um enough for taking my uh
 
06:15:24.470 --> 06:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
my question thank you
 
06:15:26.690 --> 06:15:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm a police officer at a local
 
06:15:29.270 --> 06:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
town and I go to a domestic violence and
 
06:15:31.788 --> 06:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
I find that's going to solve it a
 
06:15:33.890 --> 06:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
serious part of the injury the person
 
06:15:36.110 --> 06:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
that I've assaulted I arrest him and as
 
06:15:38.330 --> 06:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
I'm taking the jail I run a motor
 
06:15:39.770 --> 06:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
vehicle record check or whatever record
 
06:15:42.110 --> 06:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
check that you uh want to call it and it
 
06:15:44.350 --> 06:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
comes up that there's a dictator for him
 
06:15:46.970 --> 06:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
under these under these circumstances
 
06:15:49.548 --> 06:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
there are some towns that if I work for
 
06:15:51.650 --> 06:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
them they're going to tell me you can't
 
06:15:54.410 --> 06:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
contact ice to let them know that you
 
06:15:55.850 --> 06:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
have the constant
 
06:15:57.770 --> 06:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
but eventually I take him to the court
 
06:15:59.868 --> 06:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
and I bring him before a judge and I
 
06:16:02.090 --> 06:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
tell the judge that yes there is a
 
06:16:04.730 --> 06:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
detainer the judge would tell me fine I
 
06:16:06.890 --> 06:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
just got three hours to whatever time he
 
06:16:09.470 --> 06:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
gets his bail done with criminal charge
 
06:16:12.350 --> 06:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
what problems do you see by
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of a crime or a several crime
 
06:16:16.368 --> 06:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
being committed and being told not to
 
06:16:18.350 --> 06:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
contact the authority you know they're
 
06:16:20.330 --> 06:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
helping the apprehension the other of
 
06:16:22.250 --> 06:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
this particular individual concerning
 
06:16:23.570 --> 06:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
the federal law
 
06:16:25.670 --> 06:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's a couple things embedded
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
with that so one of the concerns that we
 
06:16:32.448 --> 06:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
have with detainers is prolonging a
 
06:16:34.788 --> 06:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
person's detention as a result of a
 
06:16:36.770 --> 06:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
detainer that is one of the fundamental
 
06:16:38.930 --> 06:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
concerns I have now I don't think
 
06:16:41.208 --> 06:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
there's really anything prohibiting now
 
06:16:44.270 --> 06:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
frankly local law enforcement from
 
06:16:46.368 --> 06:16:46.378 align:start position:0%
contacting ice but when we talk about
 
06:16:49.070 --> 06:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
honoring a detainer which is what this
 
06:16:51.530 --> 06:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
bill talks about it invites a situation
 
06:16:54.350 --> 06:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
where a local police department is
 
06:16:56.930 --> 06:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
detaining a person because of the
 
06:16:59.448 --> 06:16:59.458 align:start position:0%
detainer when there's no other lawful
 
06:17:01.910 --> 06:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
reason at that point to detain an
 
06:17:03.948 --> 06:17:03.958 align:start position:0%
individual so you know in a situation
 
06:17:05.930 --> 06:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about where hey hold
 
06:17:08.990 --> 06:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
the person for three hours for ice
 
06:17:10.788 --> 06:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
um you know when the person otherwise
 
06:17:13.788 --> 06:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for release that in my
 
06:17:17.030 --> 06:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
view is a problem now if ice were to
 
06:17:19.788 --> 06:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
show up at the time where that person is
 
06:17:22.850 --> 06:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
released and that person wasn't detained
 
06:17:25.250 --> 06:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
for ice pursuant to the detainer then
 
06:17:26.448 --> 06:17:26.458 align:start position:0%
you don't have a fourth amendment
 
06:17:28.010 --> 06:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
problem there
 
06:17:29.750 --> 06:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:31.910 --> 06:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay next uh
 
06:17:37.390 --> 06:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:42.590 --> 06:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes uh Ms told uh
 
06:17:44.810 --> 06:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
could I ask you to limit your testimony
 
06:17:46.250 --> 06:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
to two minutes
 
06:17:48.350 --> 06:17:48.360 align:start position:0%

which encompasses the city of Keene at
 
06:18:04.930 --> 06:18:04.940 align:start position:0%
large I'm here today in opposition to HB
 
06:18:08.330 --> 06:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
266 by allowing New Hampshire law
 
06:18:10.430 --> 06:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement to initiate investigations
 
06:18:13.128 --> 06:18:13.138 align:start position:0%
of immigration status this bill will
 
06:18:14.690 --> 06:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
essentially turn New Hampshire Law
 
06:18:16.730 --> 06:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers into Federal
 
06:18:19.368 --> 06:18:19.378 align:start position:0%
immigration officers this will have
 
06:18:22.670 --> 06:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
xenophobic and racist implications as it
 
06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
will open the door to profiling
 
06:18:26.150 --> 06:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
immigrants and racial and ethnic
 
06:18:28.788 --> 06:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
minorities I feel confident that the
 
06:18:30.650 --> 06:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
vast majority of my constituents would
 
06:18:33.110 --> 06:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and I know that our

I want to make most people have made
 
06:20:03.288 --> 06:20:03.298 align:start position:0%
um all the points that I I would uh have
 
06:20:06.350 --> 06:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
gone on at length I'll be very brief
 
06:20:08.090 --> 06:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I do want to say we can't over
 
06:20:09.650 --> 06:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
emphasize the fact that the federal
 
06:20:13.128 --> 06:20:13.138 align:start position:0%
government has decided that Federal
 
06:20:17.330 --> 06:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
immigration law violations are in in
 
06:20:20.270 --> 06:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
most of the ways not criminal acts and
 
06:20:22.730 --> 06:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
even crossing of the Border without
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
going through immigration has only been
 
06:20:27.948 --> 06:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
deemed a federal misdemeanor not a
 
06:20:27.958 --> 06:20:29.390 align:start position:0%
deemed a federal misdemeanor not a
felony

06:20:29.390 --> 06:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
felony
 
06:20:29.400 --> 06:20:30.288 align:start position:0%
felony
um

06:20:30.288 --> 06:20:30.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:34.070 --> 06:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
there is also it's uh uh attorney V
 
06:20:36.708 --> 06:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
sinat pointed it out there is a federal
 
06:20:40.070 --> 06:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
program the 287 G program that does
 
06:20:42.288 --> 06:20:42.298 align:start position:0%
allow state and local law enforcement
 
06:20:44.930 --> 06:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
entities to work with immigration and be
 
06:20:47.090 --> 06:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
sort of deputized to do immigration law
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
work and that's really the only way that
 
06:20:52.368 --> 06:20:52.378 align:start position:0%
a local entity could enforce Federal
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
immigration law and according to the ice
 
06:20:56.990 --> 06:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
website there were no law enforcement
 
06:20:58.490 --> 06:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
entities in New Hampshire that have
 
06:21:01.670 --> 06:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
opted to do that a 2009 police
 
06:21:05.448 --> 06:21:05.458 align:start position:0%
foundation study about this very issue
 
06:21:09.650 --> 06:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
felt that having police focused in on
 
06:21:14.510 --> 06:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
um enforcement of federal civil law was
 
06:21:17.270 --> 06:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
not a good decision for most departments
 
06:21:19.548 --> 06:21:19.558 align:start position:0%
and that most police chief students feel
 
06:21:21.110 --> 06:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
that it would be good for their
 
06:21:21.120 --> 06:21:22.850 align:start position:0%
that it would be good for their
departments

06:21:22.850 --> 06:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
departments
 
06:21:25.250 --> 06:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I did want to answer a question that
 
06:21:27.410 --> 06:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
one one of the representatives asked
 
06:21:30.048 --> 06:21:30.058 align:start position:0%
earlier about the 48-hour issue with
 
06:21:32.750 --> 06:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
detention that specifically relates to
 
06:21:32.760 --> 06:21:33.770 align:start position:0%
detention that specifically relates to
the

06:21:33.770 --> 06:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:36.410 --> 06:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
um civil immigration detainer where um
 
06:21:36.420 --> 06:21:37.368 align:start position:0%
um civil immigration detainer where um
the

06:21:37.368 --> 06:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:40.250 --> 06:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
um enforcement agent is asking the local
 
06:21:43.010 --> 06:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
law enforcement folks to hold for 48
 
06:21:45.230 --> 06:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
hours up to 48 hours and I agree with
 
06:21:48.048 --> 06:21:48.058 align:start position:0%
Zeal that three hours or five minutes
 
06:21:50.330 --> 06:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
after that person should have been set
 
06:21:54.590 --> 06:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
free is triggers a violation of the our
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
state or federal Constitution there is a
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts case where a court officer
 
06:22:01.200 --> 06:22:02.448 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts case where a court officer
held

06:22:02.448 --> 06:22:02.458 align:start position:0%
held
 
06:22:06.708 --> 06:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
um a a defendant after he was would have
 
06:22:08.810 --> 06:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
been released from Court Lund versus
 
06:22:11.990 --> 06:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth and the Supreme Judicial
 
06:22:14.270 --> 06:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
Court of Massachusetts entertained that
 
06:22:17.750 --> 06:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
and found that that was a violation of
 
06:22:19.430 --> 06:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
federal law as constitutional law
 
06:22:21.650 --> 06:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
violation I will also say in working
 
06:22:24.288 --> 06:22:24.298 align:start position:0%
with police departments to make fair and
 
06:22:26.930 --> 06:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
impartial policing policies
 
06:22:28.070 --> 06:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
um that we worked with the New Hampshire
 
06:22:31.250 --> 06:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
State Police the ACLU did as well and
 
06:22:33.048 --> 06:22:33.058 align:start position:0%
the state police brought in our State
 
06:22:35.930 --> 06:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to look at our
 
06:22:38.750 --> 06:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
position that civil immigration
 
06:22:41.270 --> 06:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
detainers were legally problematic for
 
06:22:44.030 --> 06:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and I believe that they
 
06:22:46.250 --> 06:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
agreed because the state police issued
 
06:22:48.410 --> 06:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
what's been now considered a model
 
06:22:51.230 --> 06:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
policy it's at police standards training
 
06:22:53.208 --> 06:22:53.218 align:start position:0%
Council as an exhibit to a model
 
06:22:56.030 --> 06:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
policing policy and it explicitly does
 
06:22:58.250 --> 06:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
not permit detention on civil
 
06:23:00.770 --> 06:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
immigration detainers I think that's all
 
06:23:02.570 --> 06:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
I wanted to say thank you very much for
 
06:23:04.270 --> 06:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
06:23:08.090 --> 06:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you uh our next
 
06:23:11.570 --> 06:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
comments will come from Mr Bruno Soares
 
06:23:14.628 --> 06:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
and Catholic Charities who wants to
 
06:23:14.638 --> 06:23:15.470 align:start position:0%
and Catholic Charities who wants to
speak

sorry Wellington
 
06:23:38.810 --> 06:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
when you talk about
 
06:23:41.530 --> 06:23:41.540 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
06:23:46.010 --> 06:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
detainee and detaining
 
06:23:49.730 --> 06:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
people for more than
 
06:23:52.910 --> 06:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
or less than what they should
 
06:23:56.270 --> 06:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
if there is no crime committed
 
06:23:58.690 --> 06:23:58.700 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:24:01.128 --> 06:24:01.138 align:start position:0%
a crime by
 
06:24:04.490 --> 06:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
the authorities
 
06:24:04.500 --> 06:24:05.750 align:start position:0%
the authorities
uh

06:24:05.750 --> 06:24:05.760 align:start position:0%

06:24:08.208 --> 06:24:08.218 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Amanda pootie I
 
06:24:09.948 --> 06:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say and by the way I'm
 
06:24:13.030 --> 06:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
Christine Wellington you can't see me
 
06:24:17.690 --> 06:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:17.700 --> 06:24:18.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:24:18.730 --> 06:24:18.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:23.390 --> 06:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
yes if it it's there's so many
 
06:24:26.448 --> 06:24:26.458 align:start position:0%
um cases that it it's not a crime it's a
 
06:24:28.390 --> 06:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
civil rights violation it's a
 
06:24:31.368 --> 06:24:31.378 align:start position:0%
constitutional law violation
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
um when an office a law enforcement
 
06:24:36.170 --> 06:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
officer or a state actor violates
 
06:24:38.868 --> 06:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
somebody's rights it's not a crime to do
 
06:24:40.670 --> 06:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
that but it's a it's a civil rights
 
06:24:43.548 --> 06:24:43.558 align:start position:0%
violation and deal the an expert on
 
06:24:46.010 --> 06:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
civil rights violations could probably
 
06:24:48.350 --> 06:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
answer those questions
 
06:24:52.128 --> 06:24:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:53.868 --> 06:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:24:55.490 --> 06:24:55.500 align:start position:0%

afternoon uh Mr chair and members of the
 
06:25:15.350 --> 06:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I'm going to try to be
 
06:25:18.708 --> 06:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh very brief my name is Bruno Souris I
 
06:25:21.288 --> 06:25:21.298 align:start position:0%
am an advocate and I try to
 
06:25:23.570 --> 06:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative uh from with the
 
06:25:25.070 --> 06:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice secretary
 
06:25:27.288 --> 06:25:27.298 align:start position:0%
Charities New Hampshire and I have
 
06:25:29.390 --> 06:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
worked with immigration law for several
 
06:25:32.090 --> 06:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
years now uh instead of giving my
 
06:25:35.270 --> 06:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
testimony I would like uh to answer some
 
06:25:37.070 --> 06:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
of the the previous questions that that
 
06:25:39.530 --> 06:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
were asked previously so I'm going to
 
06:25:42.350 --> 06:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
try to be very brief although I mean not
 
06:25:46.310 --> 06:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
Eminem and can say 4.28 Awards per
 
06:25:49.788 --> 06:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
second I'm gonna try to do my best
 
06:25:52.190 --> 06:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
um so the the first point that I would
 
06:25:55.730 --> 06:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
like to clarify uh there was a comment
 
06:25:57.788 --> 06:25:57.798 align:start position:0%
about Alice Island
 
06:26:01.070 --> 06:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh that the uh that the parents and
 
06:26:03.110 --> 06:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
great uh grandparents great grandparents
 
06:26:06.948 --> 06:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
came through Ellis Island uh legally uh
 
06:26:09.830 --> 06:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
so technically if we compare to to that
 
06:26:13.368 --> 06:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
uh to to current immigration policy that
 
06:26:15.650 --> 06:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
would also be considered uh you know the
 
06:26:17.930 --> 06:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
terms that have uh that have been used
 
06:26:20.690 --> 06:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
illegally uh and the reason being is
 
06:26:22.788 --> 06:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
because uh those individuals you know
 
06:26:24.230 --> 06:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
like would come to the United States
 
06:26:27.650 --> 06:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
without a Visa uh the equivalent uh
 
06:26:31.430 --> 06:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
immigration uh benefit to today's loss
 
06:26:34.128 --> 06:26:34.138 align:start position:0%
is called Asylum so pretty much all
 
06:26:36.530 --> 06:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
those individuals would be considered a
 
06:26:40.250 --> 06:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
side lease upon coming in another point
 
06:26:42.350 --> 06:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
that I would like to to make is that
 
06:26:44.890 --> 06:26:44.900 align:start position:0%
we've been working tightly tirelessly
 
06:26:47.750 --> 06:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
with uh the chiefs of police across New
 
06:26:51.670 --> 06:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to implement a fair policy
 
06:26:54.350 --> 06:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
where actually the chiefs of police and
 
06:26:57.470 --> 06:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement they do in fact uh
 
06:26:57.480 --> 06:26:59.208 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement they do in fact uh
enforce

06:26:59.208 --> 06:26:59.218 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
06:27:02.150 --> 06:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
um either detainers when they encounter
 
06:27:04.910 --> 06:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
someone that has committed a crime other
 
06:27:07.010 --> 06:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
than that they encourage the community
 
06:27:09.230 --> 06:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
to actually report crimes because
 
06:27:12.470 --> 06:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
undocumented folks they are victims of
 
06:27:15.410 --> 06:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
crimes as well in the State uh in
 
06:27:19.430 --> 06:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
regards to the uh 86 million uh there
 
06:27:22.128 --> 06:27:22.138 align:start position:0%
was uh mentioned I think my colleague
 
06:27:25.190 --> 06:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
asthma huni has mentioned that you know
 
06:27:28.010 --> 06:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants uh you know have
 
06:27:30.110 --> 06:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
paid you know 77 million dollars
 
06:27:32.810 --> 06:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
producing New Hampshire Alone
 
06:27:36.170 --> 06:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
um so and actually if you count all of
 
06:27:38.510 --> 06:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
the the immigrants in the state the
 
06:27:42.410 --> 06:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
amount to 1.1 billion dollars uh that
 
06:27:45.410 --> 06:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
these folks have paid
 
06:27:48.590 --> 06:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
um so and I also heard that this bill is
 
06:27:50.570 --> 06:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
not about immigration and this bill is
 
06:27:52.850 --> 06:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
definitely about immigration uh because
 
06:27:55.670 --> 06:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
it does try to control
 
06:27:59.448 --> 06:27:59.458 align:start position:0%
um uh officers uh State agents uh to
 
06:28:01.970 --> 06:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
enforce immigration laws
 
06:28:05.510 --> 06:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so representative uh if Davis
 
06:28:08.090 --> 06:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
um mentioned that this is a 10th
 
06:28:10.910 --> 06:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh violation which that's what
 
06:28:14.208 --> 06:28:14.218 align:start position:0%
my testimonial is going to be about
 
06:28:18.410 --> 06:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and she she's 100 correct
 
06:28:22.070 --> 06:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
um so and the case on point on that is
 
06:28:24.430 --> 06:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
us the Arizona
 
06:28:29.810 --> 06:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
2012 where pretty much the Supreme Court
 
06:28:34.010 --> 06:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
ruled that local law enforcement must
 
06:28:37.368 --> 06:28:37.378 align:start position:0%
not enforce immigration laws which
 
06:28:39.770 --> 06:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is a 10 thing to
 
06:28:39.780 --> 06:28:41.208 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is a 10 thing to
do

06:28:41.208 --> 06:28:41.218 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:28:43.128 --> 06:28:43.138 align:start position:0%
um and it is also
 
06:28:47.390 --> 06:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
um a 10th Amendment violation because uh
 
06:28:49.850 --> 06:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
he he confronts the supremacy clause
 
06:28:52.670 --> 06:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
because immigration law is a field that
 
06:28:55.490 --> 06:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
the federal government intends to occupy
 
06:28:59.570 --> 06:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
does it constitutes a violation
 
06:29:02.570 --> 06:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
um and I want to answer a question uh to
 
06:29:05.750 --> 06:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Porter the cost of
 
06:29:08.868 --> 06:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
becoming U.S citizen uh so you can
 
06:29:11.090 --> 06:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
become a U.S citizen uh after three
 
06:29:14.090 --> 06:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
years if you're married to a U.S citizen
 
06:29:17.270 --> 06:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
for over two years uh so you can apply
 
06:29:20.090 --> 06:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
for his citizenship and other than that
 
06:29:23.030 --> 06:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
you have to wait five years uh and the
 
06:29:25.010 --> 06:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
cost of citizenship percent the filing
 
06:29:28.208 --> 06:29:28.218 align:start position:0%
fee to the government is 725
 
06:29:30.770 --> 06:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
and the Leo that's not counting the
 
06:29:32.810 --> 06:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
legal fees if you go to a private
 
06:29:35.510 --> 06:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
attorney it can vary from one thousand
 
06:29:37.070 --> 06:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
dollars to five thousand dollars
 
06:29:40.368 --> 06:29:40.378 align:start position:0%
depending on the attorney
 
06:29:40.378 --> 06:29:42.230 align:start position:0%
depending on the attorney
um

06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:45.830 --> 06:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and I would like to also ask the
 
06:29:47.930 --> 06:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
question to
 
06:29:50.208 --> 06:29:50.218 align:start position:0%
um if possible to they sponsor the bill
 
06:29:52.628 --> 06:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
and the person that I spoke right after
 
06:29:56.750 --> 06:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh about uh immigrants being criminals
 
06:30:00.530 --> 06:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so she cited a few
 
06:30:03.830 --> 06:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
um a few individuals but I wonder how
 
06:30:07.250 --> 06:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
many uh undocumented immigrants are
 
06:30:11.448 --> 06:30:11.458 align:start position:0%
actually uh charged with crimes all the
 
06:30:15.590 --> 06:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
time for driving related offenses in the
 
06:30:19.430 --> 06:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
state and are incarcerated Mr sores I'm
 
06:30:21.110 --> 06:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
sorry this is not an opportunity to
 
06:30:23.930 --> 06:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
debate with other uh folks here because
 
06:30:25.730 --> 06:30:25.740 align:start position:0%

um and that actually concludes my
 
06:30:34.610 --> 06:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so much all right
 
06:30:36.948 --> 06:30:36.958 align:start position:0%

mentioned about the economic uh impact
 
06:31:02.390 --> 06:31:02.400 align:start position:0%

undocumented workers pay income tax yes
 
06:31:10.190 --> 06:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct
 
06:31:12.708 --> 06:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman
 
06:31:15.530 --> 06:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
it's all up go right ahead yes thank you
 
06:31:19.368 --> 06:31:19.378 align:start position:0%
uh so they pay income tax but if I
 
06:31:21.830 --> 06:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
understand correctly they are not
 
06:31:27.430 --> 06:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for any uh federal or state
 
06:31:31.788 --> 06:31:31.798 align:start position:0%
subsidies like uh snap or housing
 
06:31:34.070 --> 06:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
assistance or anything like that is that
 
06:31:34.080 --> 06:31:34.788 align:start position:0%
assistance or anything like that is that
true

06:31:34.788 --> 06:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
true
 
06:31:37.128 --> 06:31:37.138 align:start position:0%
that is correct they're not eligible to
 
06:31:40.788 --> 06:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
any uh state or federal uh funded uh
 
06:31:40.798 --> 06:31:43.010 align:start position:0%
any uh state or federal uh funded uh
programs

06:31:43.010 --> 06:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
programs
 
06:31:45.530 --> 06:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
including the stimulus checks so none of
 
06:31:47.810 --> 06:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
them documented folks receive the other
 
06:31:49.368 --> 06:31:49.378 align:start position:0%
stimulus checks
 
06:31:53.510 --> 06:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:56.150 --> 06:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
all right um yeah I was wondering if
 
06:31:58.610 --> 06:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
since you were um with Catholic
 
06:32:00.890 --> 06:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
Charities of New Hampshire
 
06:32:00.900 --> 06:32:01.730 align:start position:0%
Charities of New Hampshire
um

06:32:01.730 --> 06:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:01.740 --> 06:32:03.410 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:32:03.410 --> 06:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:32:03.420 --> 06:32:04.610 align:start position:0%
so
uh

06:32:04.610 --> 06:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:32:06.530 --> 06:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
or well does that imply that you're
 
06:32:09.730 --> 06:32:09.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:12.170 --> 06:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
I think that that's an inappropriate
 
06:32:14.690 --> 06:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
question or well all right
 
06:32:16.970 --> 06:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
um let me rephrase what does your
 
06:32:19.430 --> 06:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
position with how how does your position
 
06:32:22.070 --> 06:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
as a worker with
 
06:32:26.208 --> 06:32:26.218 align:start position:0%
Catholic Charities of New Hampshire
 
06:32:30.048 --> 06:32:30.058 align:start position:0%
um informed how does your faith inform
 
06:32:31.670 --> 06:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
um your
 
06:32:35.030 --> 06:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh the points you've raised on this
 
06:32:37.270 --> 06:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
issue so far
 
06:32:39.890 --> 06:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Fuller for your question so
 
06:32:42.170 --> 06:32:42.180 align:start position:0%

06:32:45.110 --> 06:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
on uh values and
 
06:32:47.048 --> 06:32:47.058 align:start position:0%

06:32:56.690 --> 06:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
um you know something that I you know
 
06:32:59.810 --> 06:32:59.820 align:start position:0%

06:34:21.490 --> 06:34:21.500 align:start position:0%
um so it depends uh representative
 
06:34:24.288 --> 06:34:24.298 align:start position:0%
manjapuri uh there are various uh
 
06:34:27.170 --> 06:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
categories so we have uh immediate
 
06:34:29.150 --> 06:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
relative which you know like a pretty
 
06:34:32.090 --> 06:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
much uh you know the spouse uh minor
 
06:34:34.490 --> 06:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
children which under immigration is
 
06:34:37.190 --> 06:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
someone under the age of 21 uh that is

not married uh and parents of U.S
 
06:34:43.610 --> 06:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
citizens that they can uh you know like
 
06:34:46.548 --> 06:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
apply and you know the Visa becomes not
 
06:34:48.650 --> 06:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
available immediately they're not in a
 
06:34:51.230 --> 06:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
preference category uh but then there
 
06:34:52.970 --> 06:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
are you know like everybody else they
 
06:34:55.250 --> 06:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
are put in a list which is called a
 
06:34:58.430 --> 06:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
preference uh category which they'll
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
wait list can go from four years uh to
 
06:35:06.948 --> 06:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
30 years over 30 years uh wait uh you
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%

they fall under a bracket of you know
 
06:35:16.010 --> 06:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
like um you know the average of uh 15 20
 
06:35:18.708 --> 06:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
years so most of the clients that that I

deal with uh they are you know they have
 
06:35:22.720 --> 06:35:22.730 align:start position:0%

time frame be
 
06:35:49.190 --> 06:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
so pretty much at the end uh because in
 
06:35:51.230 --> 06:35:51.240 align:start position:0%

06:35:54.708 --> 06:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
know immigrant Visa so upon the end of
 
06:35:57.830 --> 06:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
your uh immigrant Visa you have
 
06:36:01.270 --> 06:36:01.280 align:start position:0%

06:36:08.510 --> 06:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
growing on lots of presence
 
06:36:10.430 --> 06:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
you have another question from the
 
06:36:10.440 --> 06:36:12.110 align:start position:0%
you have another question from the
president

06:36:12.110 --> 06:36:12.120 align:start position:0%

yes thank you Mr Soros for taking my
 
06:36:18.048 --> 06:36:18.058 align:start position:0%

06:36:21.948 --> 06:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
my head oh my gosh
 
06:36:21.958 --> 06:36:23.270 align:start position:0%
my head oh my gosh

oh
 
06:36:25.310 --> 06:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
um I think what uh representative
 
06:36:27.770 --> 06:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
Gauthier might be or Gallagher might
 
06:36:31.670 --> 06:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
have been looking for is a brief
 
06:36:34.670 --> 06:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
information about the mission of the
 
06:36:35.930 --> 06:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
Catholic Charities of New Hampshire
 
06:36:37.970 --> 06:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
could you give us a thumbnail of what
 
06:36:40.250 --> 06:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
your organization does
 
06:36:42.650 --> 06:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
I mean exactly
 
06:36:45.110 --> 06:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
um you know like uh mission statement I
 
06:36:48.048 --> 06:36:48.058 align:start position:0%
don't have in front of me but uh pretty
 
06:36:50.868 --> 06:36:50.878 align:start position:0%

06:36:53.150 --> 06:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
of order thank you Mr chairman no is
 
06:36:55.250 --> 06:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
your main question let's move it
 
06:36:58.548 --> 06:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
perspectively uh that that question is
 
06:37:00.048 --> 06:37:00.058 align:start position:0%
the point of order is it's a
 
06:37:02.330 --> 06:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
non-germaine question
 
06:37:02.340 --> 06:37:03.410 align:start position:0%
non-germaine question
um

06:37:03.410 --> 06:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:05.270 --> 06:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher did you have
 
06:37:08.030 --> 06:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
some clarity you want to add Mr chair
 
06:37:09.288 --> 06:37:09.298 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
06:37:12.650 --> 06:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh point of water go ahead
 
06:37:16.128 --> 06:37:16.138 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that this was a trial
 
06:37:18.708 --> 06:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's not a trial
 
06:37:20.390 --> 06:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
there to a non-germaine question
 
06:37:20.400 --> 06:37:22.970 align:start position:0%
there to a non-germaine question
objection

06:37:22.970 --> 06:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
objection
 
06:37:26.150 --> 06:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to keep the uh uh the
 
06:37:29.628 --> 06:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
questioning Jermaine to uh the uh the
 
06:37:34.190 --> 06:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
topic at at hand and uh and uh Eric uh
 
06:37:36.070 --> 06:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
rather representative Gallagher is
 
06:37:38.628 --> 06:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
perfectly capable of asking his own
 
06:37:38.638 --> 06:37:40.090 align:start position:0%
perfectly capable of asking his own
questions

06:37:40.090 --> 06:37:40.100 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:37:43.548 --> 06:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chair I'm sure do you have
 
06:37:45.350 --> 06:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
a point do you have a point of order I
 
06:37:46.970 --> 06:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
do I have a point of order
 
06:37:49.010 --> 06:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
I was not asking for representative
 
06:37:50.750 --> 06:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
Gallagher I simply referred to him
 
06:37:53.030 --> 06:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
because it made me think of this we know
 
06:37:55.610 --> 06:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
what the aclu's mission is we know what
 
06:37:57.350 --> 06:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
the American friend service committee
 
06:38:00.530 --> 06:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
mission is I don't know what Catholic
 
06:38:02.270 --> 06:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
Charities of New Hampshire's mission is

today to State my support for HB 266.
 
06:40:22.190 --> 06:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
my son is dead because of lacks
 
06:40:23.930 --> 06:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
immigration laws and the fact that
 
06:40:25.970 --> 06:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
legislators and judges have put illegal
 
06:40:28.788 --> 06:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
aliens ahead of Americans
 
06:40:31.128 --> 06:40:31.138 align:start position:0%

photos and his grave
 
06:40:50.448 --> 06:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
Advocates of sanctuary policies often
 
06:40:53.690 --> 06:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
use the term immigrant for illegal alien
 
06:40:55.970 --> 06:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
they will state that Sanctuary policies
 
06:40:58.070 --> 06:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
protect hard-working immigrants who just
 
06:41:00.048 --> 06:41:00.058 align:start position:0%
want to improve their lives that
 
06:41:03.350 --> 06:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
immigrants avoid calling 9-1-1 going to
 
06:41:05.570 --> 06:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
the hospital and seeking police in court
 
06:41:08.030 --> 06:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
protection out of fear that they will be
 
06:41:11.030 --> 06:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
reported to ice the reality is just the
 
06:41:13.788 --> 06:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
opposite Sanctuary policies protect
 
06:41:15.530 --> 06:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
illegal aliens who have committed
 
06:41:19.730 --> 06:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
additional crimes once coming here
 
06:41:22.310 --> 06:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
there is not one recorded incident of an
 
06:41:24.948 --> 06:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
illegal alien reporting a crime being
 
06:41:27.590 --> 06:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
deported there is no reason for them to
 
06:41:29.628 --> 06:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
fear making that call particularly since
 
06:41:31.850 --> 06:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
most of them are victims and would be
 
06:41:33.708 --> 06:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
eligible for a u Visa that would allow
 
06:41:36.470 --> 06:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
them to remain in the United States
 
06:41:39.230 --> 06:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policies protect criminal
 
06:41:39.240 --> 06:41:40.490 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policies protect criminal
aliens

06:41:40.490 --> 06:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
aliens
 
06:41:42.708 --> 06:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
each year thousands of people are killed
 
06:41:45.170 --> 06:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
by illegal aliens even more are raped
 
06:41:47.628 --> 06:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
forced into sex trafficking maimed
 
06:41:49.850 --> 06:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
assaulted and have their identity stolen
 
06:41:52.670 --> 06:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
yet these are the exact people
 
06:41:55.010 --> 06:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
that the sanctuary policies Protect by
 
06:41:57.110 --> 06:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
preventing local law enforcement from
 
06:41:59.690 --> 06:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
cooperating with ice if properly
 
06:42:02.030 --> 06:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
screened as our immigration system is
 
06:42:04.910 --> 06:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
required to do these criminal illegal
 
06:42:06.708 --> 06:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
aliens would never be allowed to enter
 
06:42:09.708 --> 06:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
the U.S and no one would object to that
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we hold those who have
 
06:42:14.390 --> 06:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
illegally entered the United States to
 
06:42:16.610 --> 06:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
the same standard as those who legally
 
06:42:19.368 --> 06:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
apply to come to the U.S
 
06:42:21.830 --> 06:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
it is vital for Public Safety that laws
 
06:42:23.270 --> 06:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
being forced and that includes
 
06:42:25.850 --> 06:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
immigration laws permitting the creation
 
06:42:28.010 --> 06:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
of loopholes like Sanctuary policies
 
06:42:31.368 --> 06:42:31.378 align:start position:0%
leads to local law enforcement agencies
 
06:42:33.590 --> 06:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
aiding and abetting criminal illegal
 
06:42:36.170 --> 06:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
aliens illegal aliens know this and
 
06:42:38.810 --> 06:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
that's why they flank they flock to
 
06:42:41.810 --> 06:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
sanctuary's jurisdictions
 
06:42:45.890 --> 06:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
not one citizen immigrant or another
 
06:42:48.170 --> 06:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
illegal alien should be a victim of
 
06:42:50.090 --> 06:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
another crime committed by an illegal
 
06:42:52.190 --> 06:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
alien and the odds are very strong that
 
06:42:53.990 --> 06:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
they will
 
06:42:56.330 --> 06:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
do you actually want to prevent law
 
06:42:58.310 --> 06:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement from cooperating with ice to
 
06:43:00.110 --> 06:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
enforce immigration laws and have these
 
06:43:02.208 --> 06:43:02.218 align:start position:0%
criminal illegal aliens
 
06:43:04.368 --> 06:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
who have no civil rights to be here and
 
06:43:06.170 --> 06:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
certainly no civil right to be protected
 
06:43:08.150 --> 06:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
by law enforcement agencies be the
 
06:43:10.610 --> 06:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
direct beneficiaries of reprehensible
 
06:43:13.610 --> 06:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary legislation do you want to put
 
06:43:15.230 --> 06:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
the safety and protection of New
 
06:43:16.970 --> 06:43:16.980 align:start position:0%

protect criminal illegal aliens
 
06:43:25.610 --> 06:43:25.620 align:start position:0%

emotional topic for a lot of people
 
06:45:50.410 --> 06:45:50.420 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
06:45:53.090 --> 06:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh folks from our committee who have
 
06:45:56.330 --> 06:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
tested who have asked questions as many
 
06:45:56.340 --> 06:45:58.128 align:start position:0%
tested who have asked questions as many
as

06:45:58.128 --> 06:45:58.138 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:45:58.138 --> 06:46:00.548 align:start position:0%
as
questions

06:46:00.548 --> 06:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:46:03.190 --> 06:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
for an individual
 
06:46:05.990 --> 06:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
and so I think we've had ample
 
06:46:08.390 --> 06:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's this is not a it's not
 
06:46:11.330 --> 06:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
an unlimited time period we have to uh
 
06:46:14.448 --> 06:46:14.458 align:start position:0%
do the best we can and try to hear from
 
06:46:16.730 --> 06:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
as many as we can and I think I think
 
06:46:18.770 --> 06:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
we've succeeded in that uh we'll never
 
06:46:20.810 --> 06:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
satisfy everybody but there are some
 
06:46:23.330 --> 06:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
people that probably haven't had a
 
06:46:26.090 --> 06:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
chance to testify I guess my word of
 
06:46:28.788 --> 06:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
advice would be in the future to to uh
 
06:46:30.968 --> 06:46:30.978 align:start position:0%
to sign in
 
06:46:34.128 --> 06:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
indicate hold on please the sign in
 
06:46:36.530 --> 06:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
indicate to the committee that they want
 
06:46:39.350 --> 06:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
to testify uh on the bill and how long
 
06:46:41.690 --> 06:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
they want to testify for which is part
 
06:46:43.670 --> 06:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
of the process and then we can queue
 
06:46:45.410 --> 06:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
them up and we can allocate time for
 
06:46:47.090 --> 06:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
them but if they if they don't do that
 
06:46:50.090 --> 06:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
then it's it's very difficult to try to
 
06:46:52.310 --> 06:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
just have an open-ended unlimited time
 
06:46:55.548 --> 06:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
period no no Mr chair this is with all
 
06:46:59.030 --> 06:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
due respect people who have calling are
 
06:47:03.708 --> 06:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
also signed and requested to testify and
 
06:47:06.948 --> 06:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
have been told to wait and I am just
 
06:47:10.190 --> 06:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
asking for a process and I understand
 
06:47:13.670 --> 06:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's been a long uh this is my fifth
 
06:47:16.250 --> 06:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
term I have sat through in criminal
 
06:47:19.368 --> 06:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
justice uh and Public Safety Committee
 
06:47:22.788 --> 06:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
where we heard testimonies for two days
 
06:47:26.330 --> 06:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
in a row for eight hours each I
 
06:47:29.690 --> 06:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
understand and I understand this is an
 
06:47:33.110 --> 06:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
important bill and it may not seem but
 
06:47:36.048 --> 06:47:36.058 align:start position:0%
it's important and we need to have the
 
06:47:39.410 --> 06:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
voices heard and I truly object for
 
06:47:43.610 --> 06:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
rushing through uh bill that is that
 
06:47:46.730 --> 06:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
makes an important point and changes the
 
06:47:49.010 --> 06:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
lives of many of my constituents
 
06:47:52.610 --> 06:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
including my family so I would like to
 
06:47:55.910 --> 06:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody has had or
 
06:47:59.390 --> 06:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
Affair I'm not asking for an unjust uh
 
06:48:03.230 --> 06:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
time it is a protocol I'm just asking
 
06:48:05.510 --> 06:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
for a courtesy did you have to I'm sorry
 
06:48:07.968 --> 06:48:07.978 align:start position:0%
do you have the name of anybody that uh
 
06:48:10.070 --> 06:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify that wasn't given
 
06:48:12.350 --> 06:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
that opportunity
 
06:48:15.170 --> 06:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair representative Perez says
 
06:48:17.990 --> 06:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
that she signed up to testify she has
 
06:48:20.530 --> 06:48:20.540 align:start position:0%
been waiting a long time
 
06:48:22.910 --> 06:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know why she's not on the list
 
06:48:26.448 --> 06:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
but she has signed up
 
06:48:31.190 --> 06:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I see these attendees that
 
06:48:33.288 --> 06:48:33.298 align:start position:0%
have their hands raised and they are not
 
06:48:38.330 --> 06:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
on the printed out list of the um house
 
06:48:40.610 --> 06:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
remote testimonies
 
06:48:43.490 --> 06:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
so these people that are being referred
 
06:48:46.190 --> 06:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
to at this point in time are in fact not
 
06:48:49.250 --> 06:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
on the list that we have but we're given
 
06:48:50.628 --> 06:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
a a list
 
06:48:52.730 --> 06:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh in fact it should be shared with all
 
06:48:56.510 --> 06:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
of you a list prior right before the the
 
06:48:59.510 --> 06:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
hearings begin as to who has signed up
 
06:49:02.090 --> 06:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh whether they oppose or support the
 
06:49:05.150 --> 06:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
bill uh where they're from and how much
 
06:49:07.490 --> 06:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
time they're requesting from the chair
 
06:49:10.010 --> 06:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
to speak and and actually when they
 
06:49:11.810 --> 06:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
signed up date time stamp when they
 
06:49:14.270 --> 06:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
signed up so I had that list in front of
 
06:49:19.010 --> 06:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
me and it totals a a 15 people who sign
 
06:49:21.530 --> 06:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
up to testify beyond that if they can't
 
06:49:24.350 --> 06:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
if they did not sign up to testify and
 
06:49:26.390 --> 06:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
we weren't we're not alerted then I
 
06:49:27.770 --> 06:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had that information I
 
06:49:30.110 --> 06:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've got a list that's
 
06:49:32.270 --> 06:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
longer than mine but mine came from the
 
06:49:35.150 --> 06:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr chair and that list cannot be
 
06:49:37.128 --> 06:49:37.138 align:start position:0%
updated after eight o'clock in the
 
06:49:38.930 --> 06:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
morning is what I've been told so
 
06:49:41.570 --> 06:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
anybody who signed in to testify today
 
06:49:43.190 --> 06:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
for a bill that's coming up at 11
 
06:49:45.350 --> 06:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock if they didn't get that test
 
06:49:48.110 --> 06:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
that signature in before eight it's not
 
06:49:50.390 --> 06:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
going to show up on our list and these
 
06:49:50.400 --> 06:49:51.170 align:start position:0%
going to show up on our list and these
people

06:49:51.170 --> 06:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:49:54.410 --> 06:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
have perhaps they missed the deadline
 
06:49:55.910 --> 06:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean they didn't do
 
06:49:59.150 --> 06:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
what they were supposed to do
 
06:50:00.770 --> 06:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:50:04.250 --> 06:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh representative you had a comment yes
 
06:50:06.708 --> 06:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
I I object very strongly to limiting
 
06:50:09.410 --> 06:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
debate in any way paper form and
 
06:50:12.590 --> 06:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
and especially limiting testimony from
 
06:50:15.890 --> 06:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
people who are here ready to testify
 
06:50:17.330 --> 06:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
some of whom are members of the public
 
06:50:20.090 --> 06:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
and some of whom are Representatives I
 
06:50:21.410 --> 06:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
think we should take the time to hear
 
06:50:23.990 --> 06:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
them that's what we're here for
 
06:50:25.910 --> 06:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that input any other
 
06:50:27.430 --> 06:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
comments on that
 
06:50:29.628 --> 06:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace thank you Mr
 
06:50:31.490 --> 06:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
chairman as elected representatives we
 
06:50:33.110 --> 06:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
are expected to be aware of the rules
 
06:50:34.910 --> 06:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
and proceedings and the procedure
 
06:50:36.830 --> 06:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
requirements are quite clear if you have
 
06:50:38.690 --> 06:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
not signed up to speak on the bill crime
 
06:50:43.868 --> 06:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:49.670 --> 06:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would uh in the old days hold
 
06:50:52.850 --> 06:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
on hold on uh one of the things that the
 
06:50:55.670 --> 06:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
folks can do who have who wish to offer
 
06:50:57.830 --> 06:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
commentary but didn't get an opportunity
 
06:51:00.590 --> 06:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
they can always and I always encouraged
 
06:51:03.708 --> 06:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
to submit their uh their testimony in
 
06:51:06.350 --> 06:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
writing in which we would include in the
 
06:51:08.390 --> 06:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
file in a copy to all all
 
06:51:13.390 --> 06:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:16.250 --> 06:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
well I do because in the good old days
 
06:51:18.350 --> 06:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
before we had to do this remotely
 
06:51:20.930 --> 06:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
someone could walk into our room and
 
06:51:23.390 --> 06:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
fill out a pink card and pass it on down
 
06:51:26.570 --> 06:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
to the chair regardless of the point in
 
06:51:28.968 --> 06:51:28.978 align:start position:0%
the hearing where we were
 
06:51:30.948 --> 06:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
um and I and
 
06:51:32.810 --> 06:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
that was their right and we always
 
06:51:36.170 --> 06:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
honored it and now we're saying I'm
 
06:51:38.330 --> 06:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
sorry but if you don't do it by eight
 
06:51:40.070 --> 06:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
o'clock on the day of the thing you
 
06:51:42.650 --> 06:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
can't speak and I I'm just concerned
 
06:51:48.048 --> 06:51:48.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:51.048 --> 06:51:51.058 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair uh I would just
 
06:51:52.750 --> 06:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
like to point out that this has been
 
06:51:55.788 --> 06:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
inconsistently applied that other bills
 
06:51:58.190 --> 06:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
have uh we have allowed people that
 
06:52:00.170 --> 06:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
weren't signed up by eight o'clock and I
 
06:52:03.170 --> 06:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
I just want to point that out
 
06:52:07.250 --> 06:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh stavis
 
06:52:09.110 --> 06:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would just like to
 
06:52:11.090 --> 06:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
be on record as strong as opposed to
 
06:52:14.510 --> 06:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
limiting any testimony on a bill that
 
06:52:16.548 --> 06:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
touches on the Civil Rights and the
 
06:52:19.430 --> 06:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
Constitutional obligations of our police
 
06:52:21.708 --> 06:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
and of our citizens I think it is
 
06:52:24.530 --> 06:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
unconscionable to limit debate or
 
06:52:27.048 --> 06:52:27.058 align:start position:0%
testimony on such an important bill in
 
06:52:31.208 --> 06:52:31.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:33.830 --> 06:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative magic booty
 
06:52:37.250 --> 06:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
so if I have the written testimony that
 
06:52:41.150 --> 06:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
was emailed but can I read that as a
 
06:52:44.810 --> 06:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative do I have uh right to
 
06:52:47.868 --> 06:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
read a testimony that were blocked
 
06:52:51.948 --> 06:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:55.490 --> 06:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
constraints put arbitrary constraint I
 
06:52:59.868 --> 06:52:59.878 align:start position:0%

uh representative Powell how many people
 
06:53:07.490 --> 06:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:10.310 --> 06:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
see six individuals with their hands
 
06:53:12.350 --> 06:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
raised since
 
06:53:14.030 --> 06:53:14.040 align:start position:0%

06:53:15.708 --> 06:53:15.718 align:start position:0%

06:53:17.448 --> 06:53:17.458 align:start position:0%

the matter is pressing before us on the
 
06:54:50.750 --> 06:54:50.760 align:start position:0%

those people who want to speak that they
 
06:55:06.048 --> 06:55:06.058 align:start position:0%
have very limited time to try to uh try
 
06:55:07.868 --> 06:55:07.878 align:start position:0%
to support both
 
06:55:10.968 --> 06:55:10.978 align:start position:0%
emotions on the uh committee now of
 
06:55:12.890 --> 06:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
wanting to hear additional testimony but
 
06:55:15.048 --> 06:55:15.058 align:start position:0%
also understanding that people will
 
06:55:19.070 --> 06:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
start peeling off uh and not be able to
 
06:55:20.930 --> 06:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
participate in our executive sessions
 
06:55:23.208 --> 06:55:23.218 align:start position:0%

06:55:27.110 --> 06:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
by tomorrow morning and uh or else the
 
06:55:31.368 --> 06:55:31.378 align:start position:0%
bills that that are pending uh I'm not
 
06:55:33.650 --> 06:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to finish by the end of
 
06:55:35.510 --> 06:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
the calendar well we'll have a bigger
 
06:55:37.010 --> 06:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
problem on our hands
 
06:55:39.650 --> 06:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
for all those bills we have nine nine
 
06:55:42.288 --> 06:55:42.298 align:start position:0%
bills to affect uh still before the end
 
06:55:45.048 --> 06:55:45.058 align:start position:0%
of uh end of today and we have some
 
06:55:45.058 --> 06:55:46.250 align:start position:0%
of uh end of today and we have some
additional

06:55:46.250 --> 06:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
additional
 
06:55:48.288 --> 06:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
committee reports that are still pending
 
06:55:49.788 --> 06:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
that need to be written by the end of
 
06:55:49.798 --> 06:55:50.750 align:start position:0%
that need to be written by the end of
today

06:55:50.750 --> 06:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:55:54.230 --> 06:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair yeah this chair would it be
 
06:55:56.208 --> 06:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
possible the executive bills and then
 
06:56:00.170 --> 06:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
return to the uh hearing
 
06:56:02.868 --> 06:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
um no we have to in order to exec this
 
06:56:05.990 --> 06:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill we have to complete the hearing um
 
06:56:08.810 --> 06:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
well I I think I think
 
06:56:10.910 --> 06:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
I think what I'm going to do is uh
 
06:56:13.910 --> 06:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
continue to continue to take testimony
 
06:56:17.208 --> 06:56:17.218 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to encourage those that
 
06:56:19.490 --> 06:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
are in queue to move quickly through it
 
06:56:21.770 --> 06:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
and uh they're just going to have to
 
06:56:23.390 --> 06:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
live with live with those time
 
06:56:25.190 --> 06:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
constraints and I'm going to ask the
 
06:56:30.650 --> 06:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
committee to be very uh careful uh
 
06:56:33.110 --> 06:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
given the schedule and the in the clock
 
06:56:35.510 --> 06:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
that we're working with not to prolong
 
06:56:38.510 --> 06:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
the meeting unnecessarily if if uh if
 
06:56:41.030 --> 06:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
someone else is already given the type
 
06:56:44.448 --> 06:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
of information you have some of you are
 
06:56:47.868 --> 06:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
I keep track of questions some of you
 
06:56:47.878 --> 06:56:49.208 align:start position:0%
I keep track of questions some of you
today

06:56:49.208 --> 06:56:49.218 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:56:52.310 --> 06:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
on this bill alone are up over 12
 
06:56:55.368 --> 06:56:55.378 align:start position:0%
questions uh and some of you haven't
 
06:56:57.708 --> 06:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
asked any so I'd ask you to be fair to
 
06:56:59.750 --> 06:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
your fellow committee members in terms
 
06:57:02.750 --> 06:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
of not only asking questions but also
 
06:57:05.208 --> 06:57:05.218 align:start position:0%
given the calendar I mean many of us
 
06:57:07.910 --> 06:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
will be attending
 
06:57:10.250 --> 06:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections tomorrow from early
 
06:57:12.948 --> 06:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
morning to late night so that's the that
 
06:57:16.190 --> 06:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
also plays into uh the schedule that
 
06:57:23.270 --> 06:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:25.610 --> 06:57:25.620 align:start position:0%

06:57:45.170 --> 06:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:57:47.570 --> 06:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
uh it can sense I'm I'm sensing a
 
06:57:50.270 --> 06:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
consensus among the committee instead we
 
06:57:55.010 --> 06:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:55.020 --> 06:57:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
and uh

06:57:57.410 --> 06:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:57:59.030 --> 06:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Powell could you tell us
 
06:58:04.548 --> 06:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:07.128 --> 06:58:07.138 align:start position:0%
uh why don't we uh go back and forth so
 
06:58:11.410 --> 06:58:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:15.948 --> 06:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
first we have representative Perez
 
06:58:18.128 --> 06:58:18.138 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
06:58:20.810 --> 06:58:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative Perez are you with us yes
 
06:58:23.090 --> 06:58:23.100 align:start position:0%
can you hear me I am I'm going to ask
 
06:58:25.850 --> 06:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
you to try to be brief as you can yes I
 
06:58:27.770 --> 06:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
will thank you for the opportunity to
 
06:58:31.190 --> 06:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
speak up first of all I wanted I want to
 
06:58:33.468 --> 06:58:33.478 align:start position:0%
educate a little bit like the public
 
06:58:37.010 --> 06:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
that the terminology illegal illegal
 
06:58:39.410 --> 06:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
aliens that's not the correct way to
 
06:58:42.490 --> 06:58:42.500 align:start position:0%
talk about uh people who is in document
 
06:58:45.708 --> 06:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
uh we have to talk to the people is the
 
06:58:48.170 --> 06:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
human beings they hear they pay taxes
 
06:58:50.990 --> 06:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
they are part of our communities and
 
06:58:54.170 --> 06:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
that terminology is like the human fight
 
06:58:56.510 --> 06:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
like we're not talking about humans
 
06:58:58.190 --> 06:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
06:59:00.468 --> 06:59:00.478 align:start position:0%
animals and that's not a way which we
 
06:59:02.990 --> 06:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
should be treating our community members
 
06:59:05.810 --> 06:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
and um the other thing that I want to
 
06:59:08.330 --> 06:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
say is I was born in El Salvador I
 
06:59:10.730 --> 06:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
immigrated to the United States to
 
06:59:13.548 --> 06:59:13.558 align:start position:0%
protect my family for terrorists
 
06:59:15.468 --> 06:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
um I started doing my volunteer work
 
06:59:17.810 --> 06:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire family service I
 
06:59:20.270 --> 06:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
help women from the a woman's prison who
 
06:59:22.850 --> 06:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
didn't speak Spanish like they didn't
 
06:59:24.830 --> 06:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
know how to read or write in English or
 
06:59:27.288 --> 06:59:27.298 align:start position:0%
Spanish and I teach them how to do that
 
06:59:29.690 --> 06:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
as an immigrant that was my first
 
06:59:31.850 --> 06:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
community service
 
06:59:33.650 --> 06:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
um hear people saying that immigrants
 
06:59:36.530 --> 06:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
here they're like uh criminals we're not
 
06:59:39.230 --> 06:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
criminals we hear we heal to help our
 
06:59:41.628 --> 06:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
communities we pay taxes
 
06:59:44.570 --> 06:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
we we we do a lot of them I've been
 
06:59:46.490 --> 06:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
working with them you know with within
 
06:59:48.530 --> 06:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
family service without breadcrumbs I've
 
06:59:50.150 --> 06:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
been working with the hospitals local
 
06:59:52.610 --> 06:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
hospitals when at the beginning of the
 
06:59:55.010 --> 06:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
pandemic I started doing face masks for
 
06:59:57.288 --> 06:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
hospitals and all a lot of different
 
07:00:00.288 --> 07:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
communities uh identities that they need
 
07:00:03.590 --> 07:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
face masks so I will ask you please
 
07:00:06.288 --> 07:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
please vote no to this bill we don't
 
07:00:08.690 --> 07:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
need any any more discrimination within
 
07:00:12.110 --> 07:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
our communities since 2016 people have
 
07:00:13.968 --> 07:00:13.978 align:start position:0%
enough impression they treat us like
 
07:00:17.390 --> 07:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
we're not humans even myself I was
 
07:00:19.368 --> 07:00:19.378 align:start position:0%
discriminated last year I was told that
 
07:00:20.570 --> 07:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
I didn't belong in this community
 
07:00:23.208 --> 07:00:23.218 align:start position:0%
because I was an immigrant that's
 
07:00:24.968 --> 07:00:24.978 align:start position:0%
something that that didn't happen before
 
07:00:29.448 --> 07:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
2016 we have to recognize that because a
 
07:00:31.010 --> 07:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
lot of filtrations are not there anymore
 
07:00:33.110 --> 07:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
people feel like they can treat us like
 
07:00:35.270 --> 07:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're not human beings we are human
 
07:00:37.310 --> 07:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
beings and we need to be treating
 
07:00:40.128 --> 07:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
immigrants with respect thank you so
 
07:00:42.350 --> 07:00:42.360 align:start position:0%

07:00:44.930 --> 07:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
07:00:52.810 --> 07:00:52.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:56.030 --> 07:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes and it's representative Lynn thank
 
07:00:59.448 --> 07:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
you just I just I wanna I wanna I wanna
 
07:01:01.548 --> 07:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
thank the uh the members of the
 
07:01:03.110 --> 07:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
community that uh the members of the
 
07:01:05.990 --> 07:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee that that uh that advocated
 
07:01:07.788 --> 07:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
for continuing the hearing I because I
 
07:01:11.208 --> 07:01:11.218 align:start position:0%
have to say uh Mr chair I I believe that
 
07:01:13.990 --> 07:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
I signed up to testify in this hearing
 
07:01:17.510 --> 07:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh last Friday or maybe last maybe last
 
07:01:20.208 --> 07:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
Saturday but I um I think I signed up
 
07:01:21.948 --> 07:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
pretty early
 
07:01:24.170 --> 07:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
um to testify so I don't I don't know
 
07:01:25.548 --> 07:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
what what happened I'm not blaming
 
07:01:26.868 --> 07:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
anybody but I just think there may be
 
07:01:30.350 --> 07:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
may have been some uh some uh mistake
 
07:01:32.270 --> 07:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
and anyway I'm going to keep my remarks
 
07:01:34.788 --> 07:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
very very uh very quickly because I know
 
07:01:36.048 --> 07:01:36.058 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of other work to do
 
07:01:39.230 --> 07:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say is this I don't I
 
07:01:42.230 --> 07:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
am a strong supporter of this bill I
 
07:01:44.330 --> 07:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
don't and I don't think despite what
 
07:01:45.890 --> 07:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
you've heard from other people I don't
 
07:01:48.110 --> 07:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
think that there it can be any serious
 
07:01:50.948 --> 07:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
question about the the constant
 
07:01:53.690 --> 07:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
institutionality of this bill
 
07:01:57.288 --> 07:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
um and and I would direct any if anyone
 
07:02:00.110 --> 07:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
has any wants to do any further uh
 
07:02:02.150 --> 07:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
Research into that I would suggest that
 
07:02:04.490 --> 07:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
you read a case of relatively recent
 
07:02:07.010 --> 07:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
case from the fifth Circuit Court of
 
07:02:07.020 --> 07:02:08.090 align:start position:0%
case from the fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals

07:02:08.090 --> 07:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
Appeals
 
07:02:13.010 --> 07:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's called Uh city of El cenizo versus
 
07:02:16.670 --> 07:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
Texas eight nine it's reported at 890
 
07:02:19.390 --> 07:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
Federal uh reporter Third Edition
 
07:02:23.090 --> 07:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
164 it's a fifth circuit case from 2018.
 
07:02:25.670 --> 07:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
it was written by judge Edith Jones
 
07:02:27.468 --> 07:02:27.478 align:start position:0%
she's one of the most respected federal
 
07:02:30.350 --> 07:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
judges in the country I was mentioned as
 
07:02:32.810 --> 07:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
a possible Supreme Court nominee on more
 
07:02:34.490 --> 07:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
more than one occasion
 
07:02:38.330 --> 07:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
and basically it dealt with a Texas
 
07:02:41.390 --> 07:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
State Statute that was very similar to
 
07:02:43.310 --> 07:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
the statute that the legislation that's
 
07:02:45.468 --> 07:02:45.478 align:start position:0%
proposed here and there were a lot of
 
07:02:47.868 --> 07:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities that opposed it and the
 
07:02:49.910 --> 07:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
fifth circuit uh for many of the reasons
 
07:02:52.250 --> 07:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
that are sort of advocated here by the
 
07:02:54.350 --> 07:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
opponents of this bill and the fifth
 
07:02:57.350 --> 07:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
circuit rejected all of those challenges
 
07:03:00.230 --> 07:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
um uh with the exception of one minor
 
07:03:02.090 --> 07:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
thing that's really not not at issue and
 
07:03:03.830 --> 07:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
because the language of our bill is
 
07:03:03.840 --> 07:03:05.150 align:start position:0%
because the language of our bill is
different

07:03:05.150 --> 07:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
different
 
07:03:06.830 --> 07:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
um but basically
 
07:03:08.390 --> 07:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the things that about
 
07:03:10.910 --> 07:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
which there's been some confusion
 
07:03:13.610 --> 07:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
is yes it is true
 
07:03:16.250 --> 07:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
that uh um
 
07:03:19.070 --> 07:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
entering the country illegal being in
 
07:03:20.930 --> 07:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
the country illegally is not a crime
 
07:03:24.048 --> 07:03:24.058 align:start position:0%
it's a civil violation but the
 
07:03:26.030 --> 07:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
immigration and naturalization service
 
07:03:29.810 --> 07:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
has the authority to issue a detainer
 
07:03:32.390 --> 07:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
which is an administrative arrest
 
07:03:34.788 --> 07:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
warrant it's it's it's issued
 
07:03:36.530 --> 07:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
administratively it's not issued by a
 
07:03:38.390 --> 07:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
judge but it's an administrative arrest
 
07:03:42.110 --> 07:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
warrant which empowers the ins to take a
 
07:03:44.390 --> 07:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
person into custody and what that fifth
 
07:03:48.048 --> 07:03:48.058 align:start position:0%
circuit case explains very very you know
 
07:03:51.770 --> 07:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh carefully is that that
 
07:03:54.410 --> 07:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
um although that's a although that is a
 
07:03:56.990 --> 07:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
a civil as opposed to a criminal
 
07:03:59.628 --> 07:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
violation the warrant is issued based
 
07:04:02.330 --> 07:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
upon probable cause the probable cause
 
07:04:04.548 --> 07:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
being probable cause to believe the
 
07:04:06.410 --> 07:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
person in question is in the country
 
07:04:09.830 --> 07:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
illegally and that that is sufficient
 
07:04:12.230 --> 07:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
probable cause the fact that it's not a
 
07:04:14.810 --> 07:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
crime doesn't matter and in fact if you
 
07:04:16.310 --> 07:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
07:04:18.410 --> 07:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
um under New Hampshire law the police
 
07:04:20.628 --> 07:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
are not only entitled to take a person
 
07:04:23.510 --> 07:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
into custody for crimes although that is
 
07:04:25.788 --> 07:04:25.798 align:start position:0%
obviously most of the most of the the
 
07:04:27.890 --> 07:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
occasions when they do so but they can
 
07:04:30.288 --> 07:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
take people into custody for example if
 
07:04:33.110 --> 07:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
someone is if someone is inebriated or
 
07:04:34.610 --> 07:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
if someone appears to be con you know
 
07:04:36.468 --> 07:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
appears to be
 
07:04:38.390 --> 07:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
um engaging it appears to be mentally
 
07:04:40.368 --> 07:04:40.378 align:start position:0%
unstable or is likely to hurt themselves
 
07:04:42.230 --> 07:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
or hurt someone else even though they
 
07:04:44.270 --> 07:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
haven't committed a crime the police can
 
07:04:47.030 --> 07:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
take that person into custody and detain
 
07:04:49.128 --> 07:04:49.138 align:start position:0%
them in effect and so what this fifth
 
07:04:52.070 --> 07:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
circuit case says is that
 
07:04:54.288 --> 07:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
um the same thing applies here the
 
07:04:56.510 --> 07:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
immigration and natural uh the
 
07:04:58.610 --> 07:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
immigration detainer is something that
 
07:05:01.128 --> 07:05:01.138 align:start position:0%
the police can enforce it doesn't
 
07:05:03.948 --> 07:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
violate any constitutional provision and
 
07:05:05.570 --> 07:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'll say is as far as
 
07:05:07.128 --> 07:05:07.138 align:start position:0%
this 10th Amendment issue which I
 
07:05:09.530 --> 07:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
believe represents my jury had had
 
07:05:12.890 --> 07:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
raised there's no 10th Amendment issue
 
07:05:15.830 --> 07:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
in question here because the Tenth
 
07:05:18.708 --> 07:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment would come into play only if
 
07:05:20.868 --> 07:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
it was the Federal Government
 
07:05:23.990 --> 07:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
trying to enact a statute requiring the
 
07:05:24.000 --> 07:05:25.010 align:start position:0%
trying to enact a statute requiring the
states

07:05:25.010 --> 07:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
states
 
07:05:27.968 --> 07:05:27.978 align:start position:0%
to do something this is a state statute
 
07:05:30.890 --> 07:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no 10th Amendment
 
07:05:33.708 --> 07:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
issue whatsoever because this is a state
 
07:05:37.310 --> 07:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
statute saying we the state have a DOT
 
07:05:41.448 --> 07:05:41.458 align:start position:0%
will adopt as our policy that we will uh
 
07:05:44.030 --> 07:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
cooperate with uh the federal government
 
07:05:46.010 --> 07:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
that doesn't raise a 10th Amendment
 
07:05:47.750 --> 07:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
issue at all
 
07:05:50.090 --> 07:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
um so for for those reasons I think
 
07:05:52.368 --> 07:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
there isn't any serious constitutional
 
07:05:54.250 --> 07:05:54.260 align:start position:0%
issue here this statute is
 
07:05:58.250 --> 07:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
constitutional I think it's important uh
 
07:06:01.270 --> 07:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
um that that we not uh that we allow
 
07:06:04.850 --> 07:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
State authorities to cooperate with the
 
07:06:07.368 --> 07:06:07.378 align:start position:0%
with the ins in enforcing the federal
 
07:06:10.610 --> 07:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
immigration laws because there is a real
 
07:06:12.410 --> 07:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
problem with immigration I don't think
 
07:06:14.448 --> 07:06:14.458 align:start position:0%
anybody can deny that there simply is
 
07:06:17.990 --> 07:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't be turning our no uh
 
07:06:20.330 --> 07:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
thumbing our nose at it so with that I'm
 
07:06:21.948 --> 07:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but thank
 
07:06:23.570 --> 07:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
you for giving me the time
 
07:06:27.590 --> 07:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
any questions for a representative Lynn
 
07:06:32.570 --> 07:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chair in love I'm sorry in lieu of
 
07:06:34.850 --> 07:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
time respect I will not ask any
 
07:06:34.860 --> 07:06:38.390 align:start position:0%
time respect I will not ask any
questions

07:06:38.390 --> 07:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:38.400 --> 07:06:39.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:06:39.230 --> 07:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:41.330 --> 07:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
next we have to speak it's uh
 
07:06:44.628 --> 07:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:46.430 --> 07:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
all right are you able to hear me yeah
 
07:06:48.590 --> 07:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
you sound fine go right ahead all right
 
07:06:50.390 --> 07:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to talk really fast and
 
07:06:52.310 --> 07:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
not take questions because I was on this
 
07:06:54.830 --> 07:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee last year and I uh organized
 
07:06:56.448 --> 07:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
the floor debate in favor of House Bill
 
07:06:56.458 --> 07:06:58.310 align:start position:0%
the floor debate in favor of House Bill
232

07:06:58.310 --> 07:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
232
 
07:06:58.320 --> 07:06:59.030 align:start position:0%
232
um

07:06:59.030 --> 07:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:07:01.190 --> 07:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh which every Republican on the floor
 
07:07:03.350 --> 07:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
voted for except for one and I think we
 
07:07:05.868 --> 07:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
also picked up about a dozen Democrats
 
07:07:08.030 --> 07:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I I can't remember exactly
 
07:07:11.930 --> 07:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
um this does create RSA 103-a which
 
07:07:14.868 --> 07:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
would not be part of RSA 103.
 
07:07:16.968 --> 07:07:16.978 align:start position:0%
um politicians should not be allowed to
 
07:07:19.548 --> 07:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
micromanage um
 
07:07:22.968 --> 07:07:22.978 align:start position:0%
emergency responders many peace officers
 
07:07:24.948 --> 07:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
contacted us last session in support of
 
07:07:26.270 --> 07:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
this bill because of their growing
 
07:07:28.670 --> 07:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
concerns for Public Safety most of them
 
07:07:30.530 --> 07:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
were in New Hampshire but we did get uh
 
07:07:34.190 --> 07:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
one Sheriff from Massachusetts who was
 
07:07:36.170 --> 07:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
talking about uh the effects of
 
07:07:39.530 --> 07:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
sanctuary City policies in Southern New
 
07:07:39.540 --> 07:07:40.310 align:start position:0%

estimated last session at 1200 per year
 
07:07:52.548 --> 07:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
in additional federal state and local
 
07:07:55.430 --> 07:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
taxes that's mostly state and local
 
07:07:57.230 --> 07:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
um illegal immigrants do have anchor

rates in other countries El Salvador has
 
07:08:12.468 --> 07:08:12.478 align:start position:0%
a 16 times higher homicide rate which is
 
07:08:14.810 --> 07:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
why we need why criminal background
 
07:08:17.330 --> 07:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
checks are so important uh Tucson
 
07:08:20.090 --> 07:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
reported 3 000 kidnappings in one year
 
07:08:22.730 --> 07:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
became the kidnapping capital of North
 
07:08:24.770 --> 07:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
America many of those Americans have
 
07:08:26.750 --> 07:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
never been seen or heard from again
 
07:08:28.610 --> 07:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
many Latin American gangs get
 
07:08:28.620 --> 07:08:30.190 align:start position:0%
many Latin American gangs get
established

07:08:30.190 --> 07:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
established
 
07:08:32.570 --> 07:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
down there by murdering dozens of people
 
07:08:34.250 --> 07:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
and leave their bodies on the ground in
 
07:08:37.250 --> 07:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
town centers to or to terrorize the
 
07:08:39.410 --> 07:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
locals and get their reputation Mr chair
 
07:08:42.468 --> 07:08:42.478 align:start position:0%
I object there are
 
07:08:47.590 --> 07:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:51.128 --> 07:08:51.138 align:start position:0%
I find these comments
 
07:08:56.890 --> 07:08:56.900 align:start position:0%
this is not excellent please please uh
 
07:08:59.208 --> 07:08:59.218 align:start position:0%
representative Porter
 
07:09:02.230 --> 07:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
I find that these comments
 
07:09:06.110 --> 07:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated with fact
 
07:09:10.310 --> 07:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
are disparaging and and not
 
07:09:13.670 --> 07:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
insulting to the people
 
07:09:15.650 --> 07:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
representative and I just asked you to
 
07:09:18.350 --> 07:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh to consider the comments and uh
 
07:09:18.360 --> 07:09:20.030 align:start position:0%
uh to consider the comments and uh
continue

07:09:20.030 --> 07:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
continue
 
07:09:22.128 --> 07:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
all right we'll do uh I'm just trying to
 
07:09:24.770 --> 07:09:24.780 align:start position:0%
go through the statistics as quickly as
 
07:09:26.650 --> 07:09:26.660 align:start position:0%
I can what we're trying to do
 
07:09:29.270 --> 07:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
hold on hold on hold on representative
 
07:09:31.490 --> 07:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
Raymond so what is your point of order
 
07:09:34.788 --> 07:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
earlier when a young woman was
 
07:09:38.270 --> 07:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
testifying she was near dead and she was
 
07:09:43.730 --> 07:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
told to not talk bad and not be
 
07:09:48.048 --> 07:09:48.058 align:start position:0%
disparaging and this is okay I am seeing
 
07:09:51.708 --> 07:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
such double standard Mr chair it is very
 
07:09:54.048 --> 07:09:54.058 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to serve
 
07:09:58.910 --> 07:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
it is making me so emotional and very
 
07:10:02.690 --> 07:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
stressful to see this double standard
 
07:10:06.350 --> 07:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
I understand representative to 11. well
 
07:10:09.170 --> 07:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I believe that um
 
07:10:12.070 --> 07:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson should limit his
 
07:10:15.288 --> 07:10:15.298 align:start position:0%
comments to what happens here in the
 
07:10:17.208 --> 07:10:17.218 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire not what happens
 
07:10:21.650 --> 07:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
in El Salvador or anywhere else in the
 
07:10:24.708 --> 07:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
world thank you
 
07:10:29.090 --> 07:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:31.310 --> 07:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
um I I will take questions by email but
 
07:10:33.650 --> 07:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not I just want to for interest of
 
07:10:34.910 --> 07:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
time I just want to go through these
 
07:10:36.048 --> 07:10:36.058 align:start position:0%
statistics what we're trying to do is
 
07:10:37.670 --> 07:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
prevent dangerous criminals from coming
 
07:10:39.650 --> 07:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
into the country and I'm saying that we
 
07:10:41.448 --> 07:10:41.458 align:start position:0%
have to have secure borders in order to
 
07:10:42.890 --> 07:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone coming into the
 
07:10:45.170 --> 07:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
country has been through proper criminal
 
07:10:46.788 --> 07:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
background check
 
07:10:49.070 --> 07:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
um there are 450 000 homicides around
 
07:10:52.070 --> 07:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
the world including 150 000 in Latin
 
07:10:54.350 --> 07:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
America alone it would has been
 
07:10:57.350 --> 07:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
estimated that between 630 and 650
 
07:10:59.270 --> 07:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
million people would come to America if
 
07:11:01.310 --> 07:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
they could according to Gallup and
 
07:11:03.170 --> 07:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
various immigration policy studies
 
07:11:05.208 --> 07:11:05.218 align:start position:0%
bringing their families with them so the
 
07:11:07.368 --> 07:11:07.378 align:start position:0%
total number theoretically eventually
 
07:11:08.750 --> 07:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
could be a three to five times increase
 
07:11:10.850 --> 07:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
in population if we don't enforce
 
07:11:13.368 --> 07:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
immigration laws uh multinational
 
07:11:14.990 --> 07:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
corporations of course would send
 
07:11:17.690 --> 07:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
Millions more career criminals use our
 
07:11:20.510 --> 07:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
poorest poor Canadian border and the
 
07:11:22.070 --> 07:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
only enforcement for that for the most
 
07:11:25.010 --> 07:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
part is by our own police five towns and
 
07:11:27.468 --> 07:11:27.478 align:start position:0%
cities including Manchester uh and
 
07:11:28.670 --> 07:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county were turned into
 
07:11:30.468 --> 07:11:30.478 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary cities without voters being
 
07:11:33.468 --> 07:11:33.478 align:start position:0%
consulted and people were very angry to
 
07:11:34.788 --> 07:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
find out that this has been had been
 
07:11:35.948 --> 07:11:35.958 align:start position:0%
done to their towns and cities
 
07:11:38.390 --> 07:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut
 
07:11:40.610 --> 07:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
have been made Sanctuary cities by their
 
07:11:43.128 --> 07:11:43.138 align:start position:0%
legislatures the California legislature
 
07:11:45.110 --> 07:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
actually prevents police from responding
 
07:11:48.708 --> 07:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
to emails from Ice Mr chair
 
07:11:51.288 --> 07:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
uh representative Center if you could
 
07:11:52.548 --> 07:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
just stop for a minute what's your point
 
07:11:55.430 --> 07:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever representative Davis
 
07:11:57.048 --> 07:11:57.058 align:start position:0%

07:12:00.350 --> 07:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
s talking about
 
07:12:03.948 --> 07:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing to do with this bill
 
07:12:08.090 --> 07:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
and I object to his line of testimony
 
07:12:10.730 --> 07:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay I I think uh I hear what you're
 
07:12:14.390 --> 07:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
saying uh point of order would be uh
 
07:12:16.810 --> 07:12:16.820 align:start position:0%
when we're not following our process
 
07:12:20.208 --> 07:12:20.218 align:start position:0%
We are following our process
 
07:12:22.070 --> 07:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester you have a
 
07:12:25.190 --> 07:12:25.200 align:start position:0%

07:12:32.448 --> 07:12:32.458 align:start position:0%
beginning it would be uh representative

Abramson for whom I have a great deal of
 
07:12:36.170 --> 07:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
respect and as a neighbor would you
 
07:12:38.628 --> 07:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
believe that the vote on the floor was
 
07:12:42.048 --> 07:12:42.058 align:start position:0%
211 to 132 in favor of the Ito with
 
07:12:45.048 --> 07:12:45.058 align:start position:0%
eight members of the Republican party uh
 
07:12:47.510 --> 07:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't one and uh I just had that in
 
07:12:48.708 --> 07:12:48.718 align:start position:0%

workers they are here illegally
 
07:13:06.830 --> 07:13:06.840 align:start position:0%

removing someone who's illegally
 
07:13:10.490 --> 07:13:10.500 align:start position:0%

16th and 19th century none of them asked
 
07:14:54.048 --> 07:14:54.058 align:start position:0%
for permission I don't think anything
 
07:14:56.628 --> 07:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
even went through Ellis Island we just
 
07:14:58.070 --> 07:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
showed up
 
07:14:59.990 --> 07:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's how it's been for
 
07:15:01.548 --> 07:15:01.558 align:start position:0%
most of American History so the whole
 
07:15:04.190 --> 07:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
idea of standing in line is uh
 
07:15:06.410 --> 07:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
something's not really the concept that
 
07:15:07.850 --> 07:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
we'd fire into like
 
07:15:11.270 --> 07:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
my just about all of my ancestors um
 
07:15:13.190 --> 07:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's very broadly written seems to me
 
07:15:14.390 --> 07:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
even I
 
07:15:17.390 --> 07:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
recovered by because I I have uh in one
 
07:15:19.490 --> 07:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
of uh State reps and other officials
 
07:15:20.570 --> 07:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
just been keeping an eye on the
 
07:15:22.310 --> 07:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
immigration Detention Center to
 
07:15:24.048 --> 07:15:24.058 align:start position:0%
Stratford County jail so it seems like
 
07:15:26.150 --> 07:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
even I could have my funding taken away
 
07:15:27.530 --> 07:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how that worked for you
 
07:15:29.690 --> 07:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
don't pay me my hundred bucks it's
 
07:15:33.170 --> 07:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
written very it's written very very
 
07:15:35.150 --> 07:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
broadly uh
 
07:15:38.230 --> 07:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
two concerns I'll just mention uh one is
 
07:15:40.850 --> 07:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes immigration Homeland
 
07:15:42.650 --> 07:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
Security deal with people who are
 
07:15:44.330 --> 07:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
Crossing Borders to our citizens I know
 
07:15:46.490 --> 07:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's a domestic terrorism case that's
 
07:15:50.030 --> 07:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
going on right now on federal court it's
 
07:15:52.190 --> 07:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
a person maybe related to the U.S
 
07:15:54.830 --> 07:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
Capitol terrorist attack and um he he
 
07:15:56.690 --> 07:15:56.700 align:start position:0%
was caught by immigration coming back
 
07:15:58.968 --> 07:15:58.978 align:start position:0%
from Brazil from Boston and he was he
 
07:16:00.230 --> 07:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
was a U.S citizen of New Hampshire
 
07:16:02.990 --> 07:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
resident in fact not even as far as I
 
07:16:04.730 --> 07:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
know what Brazilian ancestry I think he
 
07:16:06.948 --> 07:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
was just of a white answer I say like me
 
07:16:10.490 --> 07:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
so this does uh limit another this just
 
07:16:14.448 --> 07:16:14.458 align:start position:0%
limit a large uh large number so the ice
 
07:16:16.670 --> 07:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
and the uh and the other Homeland
 
07:16:18.350 --> 07:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
Security do do a lot of immigration
 
07:16:20.030 --> 07:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
works it's not just uh you know
 
07:16:24.288 --> 07:16:24.298 align:start position:0%
undocumented aliens and also I know
 
07:16:25.788 --> 07:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not supposed to say speculating
 
07:16:27.110 --> 07:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
people's motives but I noticed a number
 
07:16:28.850 --> 07:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
of what we call pro-gun activists
 
07:16:30.048 --> 07:16:30.058 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people from the worst
 
07:16:31.490 --> 07:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
thing possible would be
 
07:16:33.288 --> 07:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
having their guns taken away I'm just
 
07:16:34.788 --> 07:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
summarizing what they've said and
 
07:16:35.868 --> 07:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
response to other bills and there's
 
07:16:37.968 --> 07:16:37.978 align:start position:0%
nothing there's no special protection in
 
07:16:40.850 --> 07:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
here for uh guns that may be seized
 
07:16:42.948 --> 07:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
because even um
 
07:16:45.048 --> 07:16:45.058 align:start position:0%
there's even immigrants or foreign
 
07:16:46.730 --> 07:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
citizens are allowed to own guns there's
 
07:16:48.708 --> 07:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
nothing there to protect a Firearms of
 
07:16:51.350 --> 07:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
ABC's in there that's uh not really my
 
07:16:53.208 --> 07:16:53.218 align:start position:0%
issue I'm more of a gun safety guy but I
 
07:16:55.310 --> 07:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
just thought I'd mentioned it in case uh
 
07:16:58.128 --> 07:16:58.138 align:start position:0%
if the Republicans if any Republicans um
 
07:16:59.690 --> 07:16:59.700 align:start position:0%
have doubts about this and looking for
 
07:17:01.190 --> 07:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
some reasons and they could cite to a
 
07:17:03.048 --> 07:17:03.058 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill which is I think
 
07:17:06.048 --> 07:17:06.058 align:start position:0%
a very bad Bill would have Myriad of
 
07:17:08.510 --> 07:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
undocumented uh well undocumented but
 
07:17:10.368 --> 07:17:10.378 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences one of the
 
07:17:12.890 --> 07:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
phrases we like to use here and it's uh
 
07:17:15.250 --> 07:17:15.260 align:start position:0%
just funneling running fundamentally
 
07:17:17.448 --> 07:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
unfair and also takes away funding from
 
07:17:18.948 --> 07:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
local agencies so that's uh
 
07:17:21.770 --> 07:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan I didn't get uh
 
07:17:23.930 --> 07:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
your early comments whether you're in
 
07:17:27.170 --> 07:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
support or against opposition because
 
07:17:29.810 --> 07:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
I'm against it and also as I said this
 
07:17:31.490 --> 07:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
is a bad bill so I guess sometimes we
 
07:17:33.170 --> 07:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
vote for bad bills but I'm against it
 
07:17:35.330 --> 07:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
and I don't know
 
07:17:37.490 --> 07:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
also just a side comment I made the
 
07:17:39.110 --> 07:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
issue of the executive session you're
 
07:17:42.830 --> 07:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
hoping to hold after this uh came up um
 
07:17:45.468 --> 07:17:45.478 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly what deadlines
 
07:17:47.270 --> 07:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
self-imposed or imposed by the
 
07:17:49.310 --> 07:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
legislature came in but you all you have
 
07:17:51.468 --> 07:17:51.478 align:start position:0%
here is the boilerplate about executive
 
07:17:53.090 --> 07:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
session on pending legislation maybe
 
07:17:54.410 --> 07:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
held throughout the day so I think
 
07:17:56.868 --> 07:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
probably some members of community infer
 
07:17:58.968 --> 07:17:58.978 align:start position:0%
that if this ran over you would not be
 
07:18:00.948 --> 07:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
executing any bills so like the idea
 
07:18:00.958 --> 07:18:02.330 align:start position:0%
executing any bills so like the idea
that

07:18:02.330 --> 07:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:18:03.590 --> 07:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
if some of them have expression
 
07:18:05.150 --> 07:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
willingness to skip other meetings to
 
07:18:07.670 --> 07:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
accept bills but that was probably uh
 
07:18:09.590 --> 07:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's something they'll probably still
 
07:18:11.390 --> 07:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
enjoy not anticipating having to make
 
07:18:14.030 --> 07:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
when they're like the Challenger so uh
 
07:18:16.250 --> 07:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
07:18:16.260 --> 07:18:18.548 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
uh

07:18:18.548 --> 07:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:18:21.830 --> 07:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you we have uh comments uh coming
 
07:18:24.410 --> 07:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
from Marshall jesperson
 
07:18:28.070 --> 07:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
um good unmute Marshall and uh and
 
07:18:31.670 --> 07:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:33.590 --> 07:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
07:18:36.948 --> 07:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
Dolan my name is Marshall jesperson uh
 
07:18:38.930 --> 07:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'm a business owner in New Hampshire
 
07:18:41.208 --> 07:18:41.218 align:start position:0%
from Conway
 
07:18:44.270 --> 07:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh I opposed this bill for two
 
07:18:48.468 --> 07:18:48.478 align:start position:0%
reasons first uh and most selfish is we
 
07:18:50.810 --> 07:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are the second oldest
 
07:18:53.690 --> 07:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
population in the United States and we
 
07:18:55.730 --> 07:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
need young people to balance our state
 
07:18:57.410 --> 07:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
and be members of our Workforce here
 
07:19:00.170 --> 07:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
immigrants tend to be on the younger
 
07:19:03.468 --> 07:19:03.478 align:start position:0%
side and uh and throughout our history
 
07:19:07.670 --> 07:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
have tended to be and we have seen this
 
07:19:11.030 --> 07:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of the brightest most energetic and
 
07:19:14.628 --> 07:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
most uh productive of our citizens in
 
07:19:16.968 --> 07:19:16.978 align:start position:0%
fact the contributions made by our our
 
07:19:20.150 --> 07:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
first generation immigrants some of whom
 
07:19:22.430 --> 07:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
are are four bearers are just two
 
07:19:24.890 --> 07:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
numerous to list now I'm a business
 
07:19:28.310 --> 07:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
owner we employ about 200 people many of
 
07:19:30.288 --> 07:19:30.298 align:start position:0%
those are first general generation
 
07:19:32.810 --> 07:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
immigrants and I can tell you from my
 
07:19:34.910 --> 07:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
own experience some of them are the best
 
07:19:38.090 --> 07:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
brightest hardest working people we have
 
07:19:40.128 --> 07:19:40.138 align:start position:0%
in our company
 
07:19:42.110 --> 07:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
anything to make New Hampshire less
 
07:19:44.810 --> 07:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
welcoming to immigrants is definitely
 
07:19:47.090 --> 07:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
bad for business and bad for the issue
 
07:19:50.208 --> 07:19:50.218 align:start position:0%
we have of his of an aging state
 
07:19:52.430 --> 07:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
in my estimation this bill falls into
 
07:19:54.530 --> 07:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
the category of cutting off one's nose
 
07:19:58.310 --> 07:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
to spite one's face there are many more
 
07:19:59.990 --> 07:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
pressing issues I think for the
 
07:20:02.208 --> 07:20:02.218 align:start position:0%
legislature to tackle it's hard enough
 
07:20:04.010 --> 07:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
getting quality workers in our state
 
07:20:06.288 --> 07:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
without making our immigrant environment
 
07:20:08.810 --> 07:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
hostile and pushing potentially good
 
07:20:11.750 --> 07:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
workers and solid citizens to other
 
07:20:13.368 --> 07:20:13.378 align:start position:0%
competing states
 
07:20:15.890 --> 07:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
as a case in point within the last month
 
07:20:18.708 --> 07:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
one of our employees proudly became a
 
07:20:20.750 --> 07:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
new U.S citizen
 
07:20:23.208 --> 07:20:23.218 align:start position:0%
we need as a state to be more welcoming
 
07:20:24.650 --> 07:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
not less
 
07:20:27.650 --> 07:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
now secondly and equally important
 
07:20:29.690 --> 07:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
immigration policy
 
07:20:32.570 --> 07:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
I believe is properly the purview of the
 
07:20:33.890 --> 07:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
07:20:36.170 --> 07:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
the passage of laws at the state level
 
07:20:38.930 --> 07:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
is encroaching on that prerogative while
 
07:20:42.230 --> 07:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
giving them a pass on enacting universal
 
07:20:42.240 --> 07:20:43.690 align:start position:0%
giving them a pass on enacting universal
sensible

07:20:43.690 --> 07:20:43.700 align:start position:0%
sensible
 
07:20:47.270 --> 07:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
enforceable Federal legislation to deal
 
07:20:50.030 --> 07:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
with the issues that immigration
 
07:20:52.730 --> 07:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
I urge our legislature to enjoin our
 
07:20:56.150 --> 07:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives at the federal level to
 
07:20:58.430 --> 07:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
enact comprehensive legislation to deal
 
07:21:01.310 --> 07:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
with the subject of immigration at an
 
07:21:02.690 --> 07:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
appropriate level
 
07:21:05.570 --> 07:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
so I hope you'll take a look at this
 
07:21:09.770 --> 07:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
bill and find as I believe it is that
 
07:21:11.690 --> 07:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's not in the best interest of New
 
07:21:14.510 --> 07:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the nation and please vote
 
07:21:17.030 --> 07:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
no for its Passage
 
07:21:20.810 --> 07:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:25.250 --> 07:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:29.448 --> 07:21:29.458 align:start position:0%
Mr jesperson I have my hand up yes
 
07:21:31.670 --> 07:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative mangafuti

mentioned about the workforce
 
07:21:44.090 --> 07:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
can you kind of give us uh approximate
 
07:21:47.208 --> 07:21:47.218 align:start position:0%
dollar amount in terms of human
 
07:21:50.390 --> 07:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
potential that will not be harnessed if
 
07:21:53.208 --> 07:21:53.218 align:start position:0%
we become very punitive and unwelcoming
 
07:21:56.690 --> 07:21:56.700 align:start position:0%

07:22:40.250 --> 07:22:40.260 align:start position:0%

calculations on that
 
07:22:53.510 --> 07:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony we have
 
07:22:55.788 --> 07:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
about I believe one more individual
 
07:23:10.730 --> 07:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:10.740 --> 07:23:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
please

07:23:19.190 --> 07:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:21.890 --> 07:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
absolutely thanks for the click so my
 
07:23:23.868 --> 07:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
name is Tristan McLean I'm currently
 
07:23:25.850 --> 07:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
reciting in Plymouth New Hampshire and
 
07:23:28.368 --> 07:23:28.378 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the public I speak in
 
07:23:30.350 --> 07:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
the strong opposition of this bill
 
07:23:32.390 --> 07:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
strictly on ethical balance
 
07:23:34.548 --> 07:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
um despite whatever legal founding could
 
07:23:36.650 --> 07:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
be fine to be able to retain this bill
 
07:23:39.410 --> 07:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
if it happens to pass I think that is
 
07:23:42.048 --> 07:23:42.058 align:start position:0%
evidenced by earlier testimonies filled
 
07:23:43.670 --> 07:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
with racially charged language and
 
07:23:45.890 --> 07:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
Prejudice that this bill is definitely
 
07:23:49.070 --> 07:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
founded in a discriminatory fashion I
 
07:23:51.288 --> 07:23:51.298 align:start position:0%
really urge the committee and strongly
 
07:23:53.628 --> 07:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
can tell you
 
07:23:54.680 --> 07:23:54.690 align:start position:0%
as well
 
07:23:54.690 --> 07:23:55.850 align:start position:0%
as well

07:23:57.610 --> 07:23:57.620 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
07:23:59.510 --> 07:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
You're just showing your constituents
 
07:24:00.948 --> 07:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
your behavior honestly it's been
 
07:24:03.048 --> 07:24:03.058 align:start position:0%
kangaroo crew for the last couple
 
07:24:05.150 --> 07:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
hearings bye
 
07:24:05.160 --> 07:24:06.708 align:start position:0%
hearings bye
um

07:24:06.708 --> 07:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:24:08.448 --> 07:24:08.458 align:start position:0%
and I just really can't understand how
 
07:24:10.070 --> 07:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
you can support these biased testimonies
 
07:24:11.868 --> 07:24:11.878 align:start position:0%
around a woman to go on for over an hour
 
07:24:13.850 --> 07:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
then say two minutes and then finally
 
07:24:15.770 --> 07:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
recant your statements and finally go
 
07:24:17.448 --> 07:24:17.458 align:start position:0%
back to ethical Behavior
 
07:24:20.270 --> 07:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
I just think it's a real sham I will not
 
07:24:22.548 --> 07:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
07:24:25.730 --> 07:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you for your testimony
 
07:24:25.740 --> 07:24:27.830 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you for your testimony
uh

07:24:27.830 --> 07:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:24:30.110 --> 07:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's the balance of those
 
07:24:32.830 --> 07:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
people who uh request testified
 
07:24:37.128 --> 07:24:37.138 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I do not see anybody else okay
 
07:24:39.650 --> 07:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
does anybody on the committee have any
 
07:24:41.208 --> 07:24:41.218 align:start position:0%
knowledge of someone who wants to
 
07:24:46.070 --> 07:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:48.410 --> 07:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
07:24:48.420 --> 07:24:50.690 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
hearing

07:24:50.690 --> 07:24:50.700 align:start position:0%

not to say they weren't submitted

07:25:47.628 --> 07:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
be somewhere in route to her or uh or

who's gave you that message Christina
 
07:39:06.350 --> 07:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:08.150 --> 07:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
forget a message from Christina it's the
 
07:39:10.368 --> 07:39:10.378 align:start position:0%
computer audio
 
07:39:12.230 --> 07:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
can you reboot
 
07:39:14.628 --> 07:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
she said she's asking if you can reboot
 
07:39:19.310 --> 07:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:20.990 --> 07:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's a solution to everything right
 
07:39:24.230 --> 07:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah well it feels plug it in I can hear
 
07:39:29.750 --> 07:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:33.110 --> 07:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
if we reboot the computer do we lose the
 
07:39:34.968 --> 07:39:34.978 align:start position:0%
connection to the meeting
 
07:39:37.490 --> 07:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
yes no not the connection to the meeting
 
07:39:39.590 --> 07:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
you starting to hear me now
 
07:39:41.390 --> 07:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
well we can hear you representative
 
07:39:44.270 --> 07:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
Dolan but um I worry that when as we're
 
07:39:45.948 --> 07:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
going into executive session the other
 
07:39:47.390 --> 07:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
folks in the room will not be heard

07:53:26.330 --> 07:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Dolan the committee report
 
07:53:30.350 --> 07:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
on 284 which was 19-0 and it merely says
 
07:53:33.288 --> 07:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
that we eliminated the sunset Clause
 
07:53:34.670 --> 07:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
because we didn't see any reason why
 
07:53:37.548 --> 07:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
these Lots shouldn't be unmerged in
 
07:53:37.558 --> 07:53:41.448 align:start position:0%
these Lots shouldn't be unmerged in
perpetuity

07:53:41.448 --> 07:53:41.458 align:start position:0%

07:55:13.788 --> 07:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
back in the day when I was an elite
 
07:55:15.468 --> 07:55:15.478 align:start position:0%
Runner I was about an hour and 22
 
07:55:17.690 --> 07:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
minutes last year was an hour and 52
 
07:55:19.968 --> 07:55:19.978 align:start position:0%
minutes wow
 
07:55:21.830 --> 07:55:21.840 align:start position:0%

you then run back down
 
07:55:34.250 --> 07:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
well one year we had to because it was
 
07:55:36.170 --> 07:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh it was icy and they wouldn't let the
 
07:55:37.788 --> 07:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
cars back up but normally no I get a
 
07:55:40.850 --> 07:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
ride down oh okay the elite run is run
 
07:55:42.770 --> 07:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
down though but that's too crazy it
 
07:55:44.448 --> 07:55:44.458 align:start position:0%
would be pretty tough to run down that
 
07:55:46.190 --> 07:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
mountain it's been more difficult coming
 
07:55:48.288 --> 07:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
down yeah it is
 
07:55:50.330 --> 07:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
so you worked at Raytheon
 
07:55:50.340 --> 07:55:53.150 align:start position:0%
so you worked at Raytheon
no

07:55:53.150 --> 07:55:53.160 align:start position:0%

07:57:16.730 --> 07:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:16.740 --> 07:57:18.288 align:start position:0%
 
again

07:57:18.288 --> 07:57:18.298 align:start position:0%

representative power through the ambient
 
07:57:33.590 --> 07:57:33.600 align:start position:0%

that's a kind of uh sleep aid I think
representative

07:57:40.730 --> 07:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:57:40.740 --> 07:57:45.288 align:start position:0%
representative
ambiently

07:57:45.288 --> 07:57:45.298 align:start position:0%

07:58:03.230 --> 07:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
we don't want that but I think that we
 
07:58:29.388 --> 07:58:29.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:29.398 --> 07:58:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:58:40.070 --> 07:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:42.350 --> 07:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
I was able to promote the computer I
 
07:58:42.360 --> 07:58:43.610 align:start position:0%
I was able to promote the computer I
think

07:58:43.610 --> 07:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:58:45.770 --> 07:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
um if someone wants to try and unmute
 
07:59:39.350 --> 07:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:43.250 --> 07:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:50.448 --> 07:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:50.458 --> 07:59:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

yes
 
07:59:56.090 --> 07:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:56.100 --> 07:59:57.170 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:59:57.170 --> 07:59:57.180 align:start position:0%

07:59:58.968 --> 07:59:58.978 align:start position:0%
we could hear you say can you hear us
 
08:00:01.610 --> 08:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
right well I'm online with you but I was
 
08:00:03.590 --> 08:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
hoping that the chair would be able to
 
08:00:05.208 --> 08:00:05.218 align:start position:0%
hear us
 
08:00:16.548 --> 08:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:18.888 --> 08:00:18.898 align:start position:0%
I have an idea go ahead Christina can
 
08:00:21.590 --> 08:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:24.468 --> 08:00:24.478 align:start position:0%
we can hear you yes uh
 
08:00:26.868 --> 08:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
my concern is are we broadcasting out to
 
08:00:30.830 --> 08:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
the public yes we are okay so can we can
 
08:00:33.830 --> 08:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
we continue the uh the briefing rather
 
08:00:35.750 --> 08:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the meeting and this
 
08:00:38.690 --> 08:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
at this stage without having the screen
 
08:00:40.310 --> 08:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the room on we don't
 
08:00:43.368 --> 08:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:45.708 --> 08:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
so long as the other Representatives can
 
08:00:48.530 --> 08:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
be seen and heard
 
08:00:51.650 --> 08:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's that's they can't do that and we
 
08:00:54.670 --> 08:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:57.410 --> 08:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
the other people in the room everybody I
 
08:01:01.670 --> 08:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:04.128 --> 08:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
I think we can
 
08:01:08.388 --> 08:01:08.398 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear all of us
 
08:01:11.150 --> 08:01:11.160 align:start position:0%

08:01:12.590 --> 08:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:01:16.910 --> 08:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:21.530 --> 08:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:27.770 --> 08:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:27.780 --> 08:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

08:01:28.910 --> 08:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:01:33.048 --> 08:01:33.058 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:11.030 --> 08:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:11.040 --> 08:02:25.548 align:start position:0%
 
uh

08:02:25.548 --> 08:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:30.288 --> 08:02:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:32.570 --> 08:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
I imagine he's rebooting at the moment
 
08:02:32.580 --> 08:02:35.208 align:start position:0%
I imagine he's rebooting at the moment
okay

08:02:35.208 --> 08:02:35.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:02:37.010 --> 08:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure if it was me because every
 
08:02:39.350 --> 08:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
now and then I lose everybody and I have
 
08:02:41.690 --> 08:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
to come back in I was thinking I might
 
08:02:43.250 --> 08:02:43.260 align:start position:0%

no idea what's going on I'm I'm kind of
 
08:03:46.490 --> 08:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
in the middle green is usually a go oh

Christina can the uh the public here so
 
08:04:02.510 --> 08:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
they just can't hear the room is that
 
08:04:04.430 --> 08:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
08:04:06.530 --> 08:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh they can hear
 
08:04:08.448 --> 08:04:08.458 align:start position:0%
um but they can't hear what's going on
 
08:04:11.270 --> 08:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the room because because
 
08:04:13.310 --> 08:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
um I was on YouTube and I was seeing
 
08:04:15.410 --> 08:04:15.420 align:start position:0%

08:04:29.570 --> 08:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:32.510 --> 08:04:32.520 align:start position:0%

from representative McBride Kevin and I
 
08:11:32.208 --> 08:11:32.218 align:start position:0%
would move that on to pass
 
08:11:34.788 --> 08:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
is there a second from representative
 
08:11:34.798 --> 08:11:35.750 align:start position:0%

08:11:48.770 --> 08:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
you can ask the clerk to take the role
 
08:11:51.650 --> 08:11:51.660 align:start position:0%

you
 
08:11:56.700 --> 08:11:57.468 align:start position:0%
you
um

08:11:57.468 --> 08:11:57.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:12:00.770 --> 08:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
I I really don't have a huge problem
 
08:12:03.110 --> 08:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
with this bill except for the word only
 
08:12:05.690 --> 08:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
and and that word gives me grief enough
 
08:12:08.930 --> 08:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
that I unfortunately can't support the
 
08:12:10.128 --> 08:12:10.138 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
08:12:11.810 --> 08:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I I think that the budget committee
 
08:12:14.330 --> 08:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
should have the opportunity it should be
 
08:12:16.968 --> 08:12:16.978 align:start position:0%
somehow in there that you know you you
 
08:12:19.610 --> 08:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
you you should be doing this only on
 
08:12:21.468 --> 08:12:21.478 align:start position:0%
Appropriations but you know where
 
08:12:21.478 --> 08:12:23.208 align:start position:0%
Appropriations but you know where
appropriate

08:12:23.208 --> 08:12:23.218 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
08:12:24.888 --> 08:12:24.898 align:start position:0%
um have that flexibility and without
 
08:12:27.650 --> 08:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
that flexibility it gives me cause for
 
08:12:30.468 --> 08:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
concern so I might I'd even like if
 
08:12:31.850 --> 08:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment or if we could
 
08:12:34.548 --> 08:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
retain it but unfortunately I apologize
 
08:12:39.430 --> 08:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:42.888 --> 08:12:42.898 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Maggiore I
 
08:12:45.468 --> 08:12:45.478 align:start position:0%
feel that the budget committee needs to
 
08:12:48.048 --> 08:12:48.058 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to weigh in on a
 
08:12:49.788 --> 08:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
bill that might not exactly have money
 
08:12:51.468 --> 08:12:51.478 align:start position:0%
in it that day
 
08:12:53.750 --> 08:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
but we'll have some sort of fiscal
 
08:12:56.930 --> 08:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
repercussions uh in the future so I'm
 
08:12:59.090 --> 08:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't support the OTP
 
08:12:59.100 --> 08:13:00.468 align:start position:0%

08:20:48.650 --> 08:20:48.660 align:start position:0%

08:21:18.590 --> 08:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair yes I hate to be
 
08:21:20.510 --> 08:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
doing this but I don't believe a
 
08:21:23.448 --> 08:21:23.458 align:start position:0%
substitute can make a emotion and write
 
08:21:26.270 --> 08:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
the majority committee report when they
 
08:21:28.310 --> 08:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
are serving as a substitute on a
 
08:21:31.788 --> 08:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
committee at least that's the rule that
 
08:21:34.070 --> 08:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
I was told last year when I wrote a
 
08:21:36.170 --> 08:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
committee report as a substitute on a
 
08:21:38.330 --> 08:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
committee and they wouldn't allow me to
 
08:21:41.330 --> 08:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
do it the clerk kicked it back I don't
 
08:21:43.490 --> 08:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
know that to be true but I'll take your
 
08:21:46.670 --> 08:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
word for it so uh can we have somebody
 
08:21:49.730 --> 08:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
else make the motion to
 
08:21:49.740 --> 08:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
else make the motion to
OTP

08:21:51.110 --> 08:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
08:21:54.468 --> 08:21:54.478 align:start position:0%
animal votp on 266. it's a
 
08:21:57.110 --> 08:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative trip and representative
 
08:22:00.350 --> 08:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
Wallace is a second okay
 
08:22:02.510 --> 08:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's Janet is there is there any further
 
08:22:05.930 --> 08:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
discussion uh yes representative uh Mr
 
08:22:07.968 --> 08:22:07.978 align:start position:0%
Wallace can't be the second I think it
 
08:22:11.270 --> 08:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
would be Mr air yeah really my comment
 
08:22:13.030 --> 08:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
08:22:16.250 --> 08:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
my comment was I'm not used to having
 
08:22:20.150 --> 08:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee say a
 
08:22:22.430 --> 08:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
specific person's name in regards to is
 
08:22:24.770 --> 08:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
there emotion is there a second so and
 
08:22:27.350 --> 08:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
so and so and so marjorie's waving her
 
08:22:29.090 --> 08:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
head so I I don't know if I'm right or
 
08:22:32.990 --> 08:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
wrong my thought is the process is is
 
08:22:35.150 --> 08:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
there emotion and then whoever is going
 
08:22:37.368 --> 08:22:37.378 align:start position:0%
to make the motion types up and says
 
08:22:40.430 --> 08:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
here's the Motion versus you calling out
 
08:22:43.670 --> 08:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
a name of someone already chosen
 
08:22:45.708 --> 08:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
it's been done both ways representative
 
08:22:47.990 --> 08:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
211 depending on the committee that you
 
08:22:50.750 --> 08:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
serve on so okay I know that we did it
 
08:22:52.968 --> 08:22:52.978 align:start position:0%
sometimes last year but uh your Point's
 
08:22:56.868 --> 08:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
taken so clear point of order can I ask
 
08:22:59.350 --> 08:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
is there a way that I could make a
 
08:23:02.510 --> 08:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
motion or that's not going to be
 
08:23:02.520 --> 08:23:04.430 align:start position:0%
motion or that's not going to be
recognized

08:23:04.430 --> 08:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
08:23:07.548 --> 08:23:07.558 align:start position:0%
uh we're in voting mode now so uh I
 
08:23:09.650 --> 08:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
understand but you know I've been trying
 
08:23:13.128 --> 08:23:13.138 align:start position:0%
to wait or say but you know it doesn't
 
08:23:15.770 --> 08:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
look like I
 
08:23:18.048 --> 08:23:18.058 align:start position:0%
I can be there you know I can make a
 
08:23:20.690 --> 08:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
motion is that process
 
08:23:20.700 --> 08:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
motion is that process
yes

08:23:22.200 --> 08:23:22.210 align:start position:0%

[Music]

08:23:26.570 --> 08:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:27.830 --> 08:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
can I ask
 
08:23:30.230 --> 08:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
Ed was representative manager putty
 
08:23:31.850 --> 08:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
trying to be recognized before the
 
08:23:34.310 --> 08:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
motion was made or she's trying to be
 
08:23:37.430 --> 08:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
recognized now I'm not sure I didn't see
 
08:23:39.548 --> 08:23:39.558 align:start position:0%
any hands up
 
08:23:42.770 --> 08:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
I was trying to find out if I can make a
 
08:23:45.350 --> 08:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
motion at all because we have done three
 
08:23:49.730 --> 08:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
votes and I you know even before I could
 
08:23:52.548 --> 08:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
raise my hand you were asked already to
 
08:23:54.170 --> 08:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
somebody to make a motion and somebody
 
08:23:56.930 --> 08:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
to love unless my name is called I
 
08:23:59.150 --> 08:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
cannot make a motion is that correct no
 
08:24:01.610 --> 08:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
you can make a motion anytime
 
08:24:06.730 --> 08:24:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:12.048 --> 08:24:12.058 align:start position:0%
right so we have a motion from uh
 
08:24:14.270 --> 08:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp and a second by
 
08:24:16.788 --> 08:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative air on 266 is there any
 
08:24:19.250 --> 08:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
additional commentary before we uh go
 
08:24:21.048 --> 08:24:21.058 align:start position:0%
into voting mode
 
08:24:24.170 --> 08:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
I would strongly oppose it I would have
 
08:24:27.230 --> 08:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
liked to make the itl motion but I was
 
08:24:29.090 --> 08:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
not recognized or I didn't have the
 
08:24:33.468 --> 08:24:33.478 align:start position:0%
opportunity so I am just going to
 
08:24:36.708 --> 08:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
well if the uh okay to proceed is uh
 
08:24:38.150 --> 08:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
voted down and there'll be an
 
08:24:39.410 --> 08:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make an alternative
 
08:24:39.420 --> 08:24:40.670 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make an alternative
motion

08:24:40.670 --> 08:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
motion
 
08:24:44.448 --> 08:24:44.458 align:start position:0%

with all due respect I have been very
 
08:26:46.310 --> 08:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
restrained and the kind of Jabs that
 
08:26:49.730 --> 08:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
have been thrown is not easy to take I
 
08:26:51.830 --> 08:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
would like all of you to be in my skin
 
08:26:55.128 --> 08:26:55.138 align:start position:0%

08:27:16.430 --> 08:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative man's bill that she uh
 
08:27:20.330 --> 08:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
08:27:22.810 --> 08:27:22.820 align:start position:0%
hi Mozart
 
08:27:27.128 --> 08:27:27.138 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I have an amendment
 
08:27:30.468 --> 08:27:30.478 align:start position:0%
so if we've got a lot to pass with
 
08:27:33.288 --> 08:27:33.298 align:start position:0%
Amendment just to see how our prior to
 
08:27:35.270 --> 08:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned I just received a motion
 
08:27:37.910 --> 08:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
to itl from representative Richard this
 
08:27:40.128 --> 08:27:40.138 align:start position:0%
is what I was talking about it was we
 
08:27:42.110 --> 08:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
were trying to get your attention but
 
08:27:44.448 --> 08:27:44.458 align:start position:0%
you make them up you don't look at it
 
08:27:48.288 --> 08:27:48.298 align:start position:0%
and this is not right Mr chair I protest
 
08:27:50.810 --> 08:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
this we were trying to make get your
 
08:27:50.820 --> 08:27:52.930 align:start position:0%
this we were trying to make get your
attention

08:27:52.930 --> 08:27:52.940 align:start position:0%
attention
 
08:27:55.010 --> 08:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
I guess you were trying to make a point
 
08:27:58.448 --> 08:27:58.458 align:start position:0%
of order uh it is it is
 
08:28:01.670 --> 08:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh within the process of the committee
 
08:28:04.070 --> 08:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the chair to recognize uh someone
 
08:28:05.990 --> 08:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
that made that makes a motion and it's
 
08:28:08.330 --> 08:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
up to the chair to recognize who the
 
08:28:12.830 --> 08:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:28:16.388 --> 08:28:16.398 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh yes
 
08:28:19.430 --> 08:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
a point of order I know maybe this
 
08:28:21.230 --> 08:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter to you or to the other
 
08:28:22.670 --> 08:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee but it
 
08:28:24.048 --> 08:28:24.058 align:start position:0%
certainly matters to me I know that
 
08:28:26.448 --> 08:28:26.458 align:start position:0%
representative van has spent
 
08:28:28.610 --> 08:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
months working on this piece of
 
08:28:32.150 --> 08:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and she has an amendment to
 
08:28:35.868 --> 08:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
fix issues that were brought forward
 
08:28:39.048 --> 08:28:39.058 align:start position:0%
I think it would be fair to allow her to
 
08:28:41.810 --> 08:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
make a motion to at least
 
08:28:44.208 --> 08:28:44.218 align:start position:0%
deal with the amendment and then take a
 
08:28:46.490 --> 08:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
vote of ought to pass as amended and if
 
08:28:50.448 --> 08:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
it fails then you can do your itl but as
 
08:28:53.030 --> 08:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
courtesy to someone who has spent months
 
08:28:56.570 --> 08:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
writing this bill it I just think it
 
08:28:58.030 --> 08:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
would be a courtesy that would be
 
08:29:00.048 --> 08:29:00.058 align:start position:0%
appreciated by the members of the
 
08:29:00.058 --> 08:29:01.510 align:start position:0%
appreciated by the members of the
minority

08:29:01.510 --> 08:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
minority
 
08:29:04.930 --> 08:29:04.940 align:start position:0%
yeah representative yeah
 
08:29:08.030 --> 08:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
last year I mean I tried to do the same
 
08:29:11.990 --> 08:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
thing and uh representative I mean the
 
08:29:14.270 --> 08:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
chair Crossing
 
08:29:19.128 --> 08:29:19.138 align:start position:0%
took uh the way he wanted to make these
 
08:29:23.030 --> 08:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
decisions to uh correct the or do the
 
08:29:23.040 --> 08:29:24.350 align:start position:0%
decisions to uh correct the or do the
vote

08:29:24.350 --> 08:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
vote
 
08:29:27.410 --> 08:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
um and I lost out I mean you know I felt
 
08:29:28.990 --> 08:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
badly last year
 
08:29:31.610 --> 08:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
that's the way that cheer decides to do
 
08:29:33.468 --> 08:29:33.478 align:start position:0%
things you have to put up with that you
 
08:29:33.478 --> 08:29:34.788 align:start position:0%
things you have to put up with that you
know

08:29:34.788 --> 08:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
know
 
08:29:37.610 --> 08:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
point of order Mr chair yes what's your
 
08:29:39.770 --> 08:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
point of water
 
08:29:41.810 --> 08:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
I unders I understand about last year
 
08:29:44.448 --> 08:29:44.458 align:start position:0%
but here we are now in this year with a
 
08:29:47.030 --> 08:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
very different environment going on I'm
 
08:29:49.490 --> 08:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
a little square box rectangular box in
 
08:29:52.190 --> 08:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
front of you right now and however many
 
08:29:54.650 --> 08:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
of you are in the lob you're all people
 
08:29:56.750 --> 08:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
who can see one another and chat with
 
08:29:59.810 --> 08:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
one another and be off the camera we
 
08:30:03.048 --> 08:30:03.058 align:start position:0%
 
08:30:05.868 --> 08:30:05.878 align:start position:0%
hand you know the one that we can raise
 
08:30:08.628 --> 08:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
or we could shout out which I understand
 
08:30:10.850 --> 08:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate to get the chair's
 
08:30:13.070 --> 08:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
attention so I think there needs to be
 
08:30:16.610 --> 08:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
some awareness and latitude in this and
 
08:30:18.530 --> 08:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
I think that especially the chair since
 
08:30:22.128 --> 08:30:22.138 align:start position:0%
he's the person with the power to
 
08:30:24.708 --> 08:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
supervise all of us that he made sure
 
08:30:26.570 --> 08:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
we're all included
 
08:30:28.250 --> 08:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:30:28.260 --> 08:30:29.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

08:30:29.510 --> 08:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:30:30.850 --> 08:30:30.860 align:start position:0%
uh in in
 
08:30:36.230 --> 08:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
deference to the ranking member who who
 
08:30:41.230 --> 08:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
I have worked with now for two sessions
 
08:30:43.250 --> 08:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
08:30:45.048 --> 08:30:45.058 align:start position:0%
out of sensitivity to what

rest of the committee does
 
08:33:42.410 --> 08:33:42.420 align:start position:0%

received a copy of it through
 
08:33:45.910 --> 08:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
distribution okay perfect that's fine
 
08:33:50.150 --> 08:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
you don't have a copy no I do not no I
 
08:33:52.730 --> 08:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
think the amendment had to do with water
 
08:33:55.968 --> 08:33:55.978 align:start position:0%
and sewer uh issues is that correct
 
08:33:58.368 --> 08:33:58.378 align:start position:0%
uh it has to do with water and sewer
 
08:34:01.610 --> 08:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
issues we struck the words or which can
 
08:34:03.830 --> 08:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
be connected to Water and Sewer by any
 
08:34:08.750 --> 08:34:08.760 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair

planning board to make these changes not
 
08:40:55.788 --> 08:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
the state and I believe we heard

testimony that said if if this is a
 
08:41:00.110 --> 08:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
slippery slope kind of bill
 
08:41:01.850 --> 08:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
um once we start changing on the state
 
08:41:03.948 --> 08:41:03.958 align:start position:0%

08:45:48.170 --> 08:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair yes
 
08:45:48.180 --> 08:45:49.150 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair yes
um

08:45:49.150 --> 08:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:45:52.430 --> 08:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
well I guess just not fast enough I I
 
08:45:53.690 --> 08:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have gone in there
 
08:45:55.490 --> 08:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
and had a discussion about the amendment
 
08:45:56.990 --> 08:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the merits of the bill which we've
 
08:45:59.868 --> 08:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about for a a tool in the
 
08:46:01.730 --> 08:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
toolbox to help the affordable housing
 
08:46:04.490 --> 08:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but unfortunately I
 
08:46:06.830 --> 08:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't quick enough and uh you know
 
08:46:09.048 --> 08:46:09.058 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt me I have a house I guess
 
08:46:10.430 --> 08:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
this hurts the people of New Hampshire
 
08:46:13.670 --> 08:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll be voting against the itl maybe
 
08:46:15.110 --> 08:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
you need to get some coaching from
 
08:46:16.610 --> 08:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester booty she's
 
08:46:19.430 --> 08:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
developed a quick draw off the off the
 
08:46:22.010 --> 08:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
market she's getting pretty quick
 
08:46:24.830 --> 08:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
that was that was a bad attempt do I
 
08:46:28.448 --> 08:46:28.458 align:start position:0%
take that as a compliment or a uh
 
08:46:30.650 --> 08:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
that is a problem
 
08:46:33.410 --> 08:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative you have a question
 
08:46:35.570 --> 08:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
I have a comment I don't have a question
 
08:46:35.580 --> 08:46:38.750 align:start position:0%
I have a comment I don't have a question
yes

08:46:38.750 --> 08:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:46:41.090 --> 08:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
Paul that we would yell this bill
 
08:46:44.150 --> 08:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
so many people spoke in favor of it and
 
08:46:46.670 --> 08:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
it allows City student towns to know
 
08:46:49.010 --> 08:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
exactly what they're doing and to again
 
08:46:50.990 --> 08:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the citizens in the
 
08:46:53.628 --> 08:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh I don't know
 
08:46:55.310 --> 08:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
what the problem is with it I don't know
 
08:46:58.010 --> 08:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
why we would itl it and if someone wants
 
08:47:00.830 --> 08:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
to explain that to me I might listen for
 
08:47:02.510 --> 08:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
30 seconds
 
08:47:06.110 --> 08:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
but I I won't I won't vote to itl just
 
08:47:06.120 --> 08:47:07.250 align:start position:0%
but I I won't I won't vote to itl just
sorry

08:47:07.250 --> 08:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
08:47:09.410 --> 08:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
I understand is there any is there any
 
08:47:11.868 --> 08:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
other discussion or comment yeah yes
 
08:47:14.270 --> 08:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
08:47:17.388 --> 08:47:17.398 align:start position:0%
um I I agree with um uh first
 
08:47:19.368 --> 08:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
representative majority who introduced
 
08:47:21.170 --> 08:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
the bill but also it's enabling
 
08:47:24.350 --> 08:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
legislation so a town doesn't have to uh
 
08:47:26.388 --> 08:47:26.398 align:start position:0%
take this on it's not mandated by the
 
08:47:27.948 --> 08:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
state so if you don't want tiny houses
 
08:47:33.250 --> 08:47:33.260 align:start position:0%
 
08:47:35.448 --> 08:47:35.458 align:start position:0%
had a comment
 
08:47:38.570 --> 08:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
yes I do I guess my question is what's
 
08:47:40.330 --> 08:47:40.340 align:start position:0%
our plan for housing in New Hampshire
 
08:47:42.650 --> 08:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
because I don't see that we're making
 
08:47:45.708 --> 08:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
any project any process progress at all
 
08:47:48.590 --> 08:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
on any of these housing bills
 
08:47:50.868 --> 08:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
I I just don't understand what we're
 
08:47:52.610 --> 08:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
going to do I mean I'm beginning to
 
08:47:54.590 --> 08:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
believe that the answer is we're going
 
08:47:56.388 --> 08:47:56.398 align:start position:0%
to build a giant parking lot and let
 
08:47:58.730 --> 08:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
people Park their cars there and live in
 
08:48:00.350 --> 08:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
their cars
 
08:48:02.030 --> 08:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
I understand how you feel I was a little
 
08:48:03.830 --> 08:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
very disappointed in how things turned
 
08:48:06.170 --> 08:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
out with the affordable housing bill as
 
08:48:07.730 --> 08:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
well but uh
 
08:48:09.968 --> 08:48:09.978 align:start position:0%
that's what happens uh representative
 
08:48:14.150 --> 08:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes my uh sentiment I
 
08:48:17.628 --> 08:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
Echo the sentiment every effort that we
 
08:48:20.628 --> 08:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
have tried to improve housing situation
 
08:48:24.190 --> 08:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
it's a crisis and for most vulnerable
 
08:48:27.830 --> 08:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
and not so vulnerable we are in the
 
08:48:30.350 --> 08:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
middle of pandemic and this just tells
 
08:48:34.128 --> 08:48:34.138 align:start position:0%
me that we are not listening to our
 
08:48:36.948 --> 08:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
constituency I got a lot of calls for
 
08:48:36.958 --> 08:48:38.930 align:start position:0%
constituency I got a lot of calls for
this

08:48:38.930 --> 08:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
08:48:41.150 --> 08:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative air
 
08:48:43.330 --> 08:48:43.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I get a lot of calls from it too
 
08:48:46.128 --> 08:48:46.138 align:start position:0%
and what my town wants to do is be left
 
08:48:48.468 --> 08:48:48.478 align:start position:0%
alone the zoning board the planning
 
08:48:50.628 --> 08:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
board want to make the decisions on what
 
08:48:52.548 --> 08:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to do for housing where
 
08:48:54.410 --> 08:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to put it what size it's
 
08:48:56.270 --> 08:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to be they don't feel that the
 
08:48:59.888 --> 08:48:59.898 align:start position:0%
state belongs in our local government
 
08:49:02.448 --> 08:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
that's all I can tell you and uh
 
08:49:04.010 --> 08:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore did you have a
 
08:49:04.020 --> 08:49:04.968 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore did you have a
comment

08:49:04.968 --> 08:49:04.978 align:start position:0%
comment
 
08:49:06.230 --> 08:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
good yeah
 
08:49:08.388 --> 08:49:08.398 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll be prophesizing but I'll
 
08:49:09.770 --> 08:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
do it a little bit quickly I serve on
 
08:49:11.208 --> 08:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
the governor's Council for inclusion and
 
08:49:12.830 --> 08:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
diversity and one of the days we were a
 
08:49:15.590 --> 08:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
bit frustrated and so uh a few of us had
 
08:49:17.570 --> 08:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
a conversation and somebody said Jim it
 
08:49:19.610 --> 08:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if you fail
 
08:49:22.128 --> 08:49:22.138 align:start position:0%
and I didn't know what that meant
 
08:49:24.410 --> 08:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and it suddenly it after a long
 
08:49:27.230 --> 08:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
conversation I'm a middle class guy with
 
08:49:29.448 --> 08:49:29.458 align:start position:0%
a house and three kids and and plenty of
 
08:49:32.150 --> 08:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
money and all that good stuff if I fail
 
08:49:34.490 --> 08:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter one bit I go on with my
 
08:49:36.650 --> 08:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
day my refrigerator is full my heat is
 
08:49:36.660 --> 08:49:37.490 align:start position:0%
day my refrigerator is full my heat is
on

08:49:37.490 --> 08:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
on
 
08:49:40.968 --> 08:49:40.978 align:start position:0%
but when I fail here in in when we're
 
08:49:43.128 --> 08:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
trying to pass legislation when I fail
 
08:49:45.770 --> 08:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
at the select board I'm failing all of
 
08:49:47.868 --> 08:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
those people who are looking to us for
 
08:49:50.150 --> 08:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
leadership I don't know how to go back
 
08:49:51.830 --> 08:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
to them with with the points that we
 
08:49:53.510 --> 08:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
have heard from representative Manju
 
08:49:56.270 --> 08:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
Puti and and and and Van and everybody
 
08:49:59.930 --> 08:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
else to say we're doing our darndest but
 
08:50:02.990 --> 08:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
I just don't have the the the reason why
 
08:50:05.330 --> 08:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
I have failed you and and that's that's
 
08:50:07.368 --> 08:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
frustrating to me so thank you for
 
08:50:08.990 --> 08:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
indulging me
 
08:50:10.430 --> 08:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments so
 
08:50:11.868 --> 08:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
representative Phil Evan you have
 
08:50:14.270 --> 08:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
additional comment thank you Mr chair I
 
08:50:14.280 --> 08:50:14.990 align:start position:0%
additional comment thank you Mr chair I
do

08:50:14.990 --> 08:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
08:50:17.090 --> 08:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
um in this air I understand exactly
 
08:50:19.490 --> 08:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from and your town
 
08:50:23.150 --> 08:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
can say no we don't want any tiny houses
 
08:50:26.208 --> 08:50:26.218 align:start position:0%
yet this is the tool that other towns
 
08:50:29.690 --> 08:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
who might want tiny houses can use to
 
08:50:32.388 --> 08:50:32.398 align:start position:0%
have a framework of what a tiny house is
 
08:50:34.850 --> 08:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
what kind of codes and regulations it
 
08:50:37.310 --> 08:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
needs to meet and that town can adopt it
 
08:50:39.410 --> 08:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
but if your town doesn't want it they
 
08:50:41.270 --> 08:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to have it this is not a
 
08:50:43.610 --> 08:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
mandate this is an enabling Bill and it
 
08:50:45.888 --> 08:50:45.898 align:start position:0%
gives people a framework where they
 
08:50:48.048 --> 08:50:48.058 align:start position:0%
don't have to reinvent the wheel they
 
08:50:50.448 --> 08:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
can look at this and say oh we can have
 
08:50:53.150 --> 08:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
a tiny house Park let's do it
 
08:50:55.430 --> 08:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative reporter can I answer
 
08:50:58.010 --> 08:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
that oh I
 
08:51:00.170 --> 08:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
representative 800 I'd rather not have a
 
08:51:01.850 --> 08:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
dialogue back and forth between
 
08:51:05.570 --> 08:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
committee members but you can make
 
08:51:07.548 --> 08:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
additional comment if you'd like
 
08:51:10.010 --> 08:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh representative Porter
 
08:51:12.888 --> 08:51:12.898 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
08:51:31.670 --> 08:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
it is a crisis the business and industry

Association has recognized it as a
 
08:51:36.650 --> 08:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
crisis the governor has recognized it as
 
08:51:38.030 --> 08:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
a crisis
 
08:51:40.368 --> 08:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
people who want young people to come and
 
08:51:42.590 --> 08:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
stay here within New Hampshire recognize
 
08:51:45.708 --> 08:51:45.718 align:start position:0%

recognize it as a crisis and over and
 
08:51:51.888 --> 08:51:51.898 align:start position:0%
over again we hear how dire the
 
08:51:53.388 --> 08:51:53.398 align:start position:0%
circumstances are
 
08:51:56.990 --> 08:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
and we are people in our state in our
 
08:51:59.628 --> 08:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
towns and cities are crying out for ways
 
08:52:02.690 --> 08:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
to help bring in affordable housing or
 
08:52:04.910 --> 08:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
housing of any kind so that people have
 
08:52:07.968 --> 08:52:07.978 align:start position:0%
an affordable place to live and every
 
08:52:10.190 --> 08:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
time this year that we've brought forth
 
08:52:14.288 --> 08:52:14.298 align:start position:0%
a viable bill that is not that is not
 
08:52:18.590 --> 08:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
mandating it's enabling it offers an
 
08:52:20.628 --> 08:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
option for towns and cities to do what
 
08:52:22.968 --> 08:52:22.978 align:start position:0%
they need to do for their folks that the
 
08:52:24.830 --> 08:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
governor is crying for that the business
 
08:52:26.750 --> 08:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
and industry and Association is crying
 
08:52:28.670 --> 08:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
for we get to this point in the
 
08:52:30.530 --> 08:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
committee and the bill is killed and I
 
08:52:34.368 --> 08:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
don't understand how we can be partisan
 
08:52:36.770 --> 08:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
about an issue like this I'm not
 
08:52:38.690 --> 08:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
understanding why it's a democratic
 
08:52:41.510 --> 08:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
issue or and not a republican issue and
 
08:52:44.208 --> 08:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
that's how these votes are coming down I
 
08:52:45.830 --> 08:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
really need someone to explain it to me
 
08:52:48.350 --> 08:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
because it is a state issue and our job
 
08:52:50.448 --> 08:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
is to take care of the people of the
 
08:52:53.330 --> 08:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
state regardless of their party and and
 
08:52:56.510 --> 08:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
this just doesn't make sense to me and I
 
08:52:58.610 --> 08:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
really would like someone to explain
 
08:53:01.070 --> 08:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to get upset but this is so
 
08:53:03.468 --> 08:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
important this is so important people
 
08:53:07.430 --> 08:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
need places to live I I our occupancy
 
08:53:10.610 --> 08:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
rate we don't don't have any openings we
 
08:53:13.030 --> 08:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
have not even one percent
 
08:53:15.770 --> 08:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in our state that's
 
08:53:15.780 --> 08:53:17.330 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in our state that's
ridiculous

08:53:17.330 --> 08:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
08:53:20.708 --> 08:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cleve
 
08:53:22.968 --> 08:53:22.978 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
08:53:22.978 --> 08:53:23.550 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

08:53:23.550 --> 08:53:23.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:53:23.560 --> 08:53:24.830 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

08:53:24.830 --> 08:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
08:53:27.110 --> 08:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
I I have to agree with everything that
 
08:53:31.448 --> 08:53:31.458 align:start position:0%
my colleagues have said about the the
 
08:53:34.670 --> 08:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
necessary housing I live here in Nashua
 
08:53:39.650 --> 08:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
and our um our availability is no it it
 
08:53:41.448 --> 08:53:41.458 align:start position:0%
it's a crime and we keep talking over
 
08:53:42.948 --> 08:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
and over again all the things we want to
 
08:53:45.230 --> 08:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
do to get young people to come into the
 
08:53:47.270 --> 08:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
state we talk about all the things that
 
08:53:48.770 --> 08:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
we want to do
 
08:53:52.308 --> 08:53:52.318 align:start position:0%
um to keep those who are older you know
 
08:53:53.868 --> 08:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
staying within the state and not having
 
08:53:56.990 --> 08:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
to go into another type of home we have
 
08:53:59.388 --> 08:53:59.398 align:start position:0%
systematically killed every Bill and
 
08:54:01.610 --> 08:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
like you um Mr chair
 
08:54:01.620 --> 08:54:02.570 align:start position:0%
like you um Mr chair
um

08:54:02.570 --> 08:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:54:04.670 --> 08:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
my heart was broken when we lost the
 
08:54:09.468 --> 08:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
affordable housing bill it it truly it
 
08:54:11.510 --> 08:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
killed me because it I thought for sure
 
08:54:13.250 --> 08:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
that there were enough people on both
 
08:54:14.930 --> 08:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle that would want
 
08:54:16.670 --> 08:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
08:54:19.128 --> 08:54:19.138 align:start position:0%
um I I feel like right now I'm almost
 
08:54:21.530 --> 08:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
wasting my breath because the the
 
08:54:23.570 --> 08:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
everybody has made their mind and I mean
 
08:54:25.788 --> 08:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
no disrespect for anybody no matter how
 
08:54:28.010 --> 08:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
they vote but it's a very very
 
08:54:30.230 --> 08:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
frustrating thing when I hear people
 
08:54:32.388 --> 08:54:32.398 align:start position:0%
from both sides of the aisle say we need
 
08:54:34.730 --> 08:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
to increase our housing I I am an
 
08:54:36.650 --> 08:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
alderman here in Nashua and we are
 
08:54:39.530 --> 08:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
working desperately hard to to get
 
08:54:42.048 --> 08:54:42.058 align:start position:0%
affordable housing to get housing mixed
 
08:54:44.030 --> 08:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
within all communities
 
08:54:47.330 --> 08:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
um small large Adu style type of things
 
08:54:48.770 --> 08:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
08:54:50.448 --> 08:54:50.458 align:start position:0%
um I have seen this literally
 
08:54:52.548 --> 08:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
systematically in this committee alone
 
08:54:54.830 --> 08:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
just kill every one of those with the
 
08:54:56.510 --> 08:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
exception of the affordable housing we
 
08:54:58.788 --> 08:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
did that one on the floor so
 
08:55:00.468 --> 08:55:00.478 align:start position:0%
um I've said my piece and thank you for
 
08:55:07.548 --> 08:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:55:10.610 --> 08:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
08:55:13.368 --> 08:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative air
 
08:55:16.250 --> 08:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
now I just have a cona I keep hearing
 
08:55:19.010 --> 08:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again that well
 
08:55:20.750 --> 08:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
if your town wants it they can have it
 
08:55:22.968 --> 08:55:22.978 align:start position:0%
your town wants it they can have it why
 
08:55:25.190 --> 08:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
don't you guys have it you can have it
 
08:55:26.868 --> 08:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
just go to your commanderboard tell them
 
08:55:31.868 --> 08:55:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:55:33.730 --> 08:55:33.740 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
08:55:36.288 --> 08:55:36.298 align:start position:0%
please uh indicate that you want to read
 
08:55:37.730 --> 08:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
if you want to raise your hand and make
 
08:55:42.070 --> 08:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:55:45.230 --> 08:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
I see your hand up on the screen thank
 
08:55:45.240 --> 08:55:46.430 align:start position:0%
I see your hand up on the screen thank
you

08:55:46.430 --> 08:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
08:55:47.808 --> 08:55:47.818 align:start position:0%
thank you for those of us who have
 
08:55:51.170 --> 08:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
08:55:54.410 --> 08:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
more we understand that that is not the
 
08:55:56.628 --> 08:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
case that the state must Grant
 
08:55:59.510 --> 08:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
permission to the towns to do what they
 
08:56:01.788 --> 08:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
want to do and that's the purpose of
 
08:56:04.250 --> 08:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation in a Dylan's rule
 
08:56:07.070 --> 08:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
state so it's not the case that a town
 
08:56:09.170 --> 08:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
can just go out and do what it wants to
 
08:56:12.650 --> 08:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
do the town requires permission from us
 
08:56:16.610 --> 08:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
the legislators to allow it to adopt
 
08:56:19.368 --> 08:56:19.378 align:start position:0%
these measures it's not forcing them to
 
08:56:22.010 --> 08:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
do that it's simply allowing them to do
 
08:56:25.010 --> 08:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
it or leaving them alone as as your
 
08:56:27.170 --> 08:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
constituents would like to have happen
 
08:56:31.368 --> 08:56:31.378 align:start position:0%
either way it can go either way but if
 
08:56:34.070 --> 08:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
you vote to kill this bill they can only
 
08:56:37.670 --> 08:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
go one way and that's the no way
 
08:56:37.680 --> 08:56:45.288 align:start position:0%
go one way and that's the no way
foreign

08:56:45.288 --> 08:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
 
08:56:49.010 --> 08:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
08:56:51.530 --> 08:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
like to allow local jurisdictions to
 
08:56:54.288 --> 08:56:54.298 align:start position:0%
decide what to do about toxic waste we
 
08:56:56.690 --> 08:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
don't let local jurisdictions decide
 
08:57:01.368 --> 08:57:01.378 align:start position:0%
what to do about safety issues we need
 
08:57:05.570 --> 08:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
to treat housing the same way there is
 
08:57:09.830 --> 08:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
no incentive on Earth for any single
 
08:57:13.368 --> 08:57:13.378 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to ask for even a modest
 
08:57:17.150 --> 08:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
Improvement in density because the
 
08:57:20.690 --> 08:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
nimbies will kill you every time
 
08:57:24.230 --> 08:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
we have to do these kinds of things at a
 
08:57:27.350 --> 08:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
larger level because otherwise they
 
08:57:30.110 --> 08:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
won't get done and we've seen this over
 
08:57:33.230 --> 08:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
and over and over again in New Hampshire
 
08:57:36.288 --> 08:57:36.298 align:start position:0%
and across the United States
 
08:57:41.570 --> 08:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
08:57:49.128 --> 08:57:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
08:57:49.138 --> 08:57:51.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

08:57:51.770 --> 08:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:57:51.780 --> 08:57:55.448 align:start position:0%
okay

08:57:55.448 --> 08:57:55.458 align:start position:0%
 
08:57:58.670 --> 08:57:58.680 align:start position:0%

colleagues to rethink and make a

09:08:01.928 --> 09:08:01.938 align:start position:0%
 
09:08:06.350 --> 09:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
to ask a member of her caucus to write
 
09:08:10.928 --> 09:08:10.938 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report when many of them
 
09:08:14.810 --> 09:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
had not voted with the Democrats on this
 
09:08:17.510 --> 09:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill and I would just like to point out
 
09:08:21.170 --> 09:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
that we do not all vote as a Bloc and
 
09:08:24.170 --> 09:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
the assumption that we do is offensive
 
09:08:26.810 --> 09:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
my apology I was looking just to spread
 
09:08:29.088 --> 09:08:29.098 align:start position:0%
the workload a little bit so
 
09:08:29.098 --> 09:08:29.868 align:start position:0%
the workload a little bit so
um

09:08:29.868 --> 09:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:08:33.290 --> 09:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
she's our minority leader so I uh I
 
09:08:35.510 --> 09:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
turned to her for those types of things
 
09:08:37.368 --> 09:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
I will I will be more cautious going
 
09:08:41.568 --> 09:08:41.578 align:start position:0%
forward just my comment I just want to
 
09:08:44.690 --> 09:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
make sure you're a chair of the
 
09:08:46.190 --> 09:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee we are all part of this
 
09:08:49.130 --> 09:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
committee members correct so you are
 
09:08:53.868 --> 09:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
here to Chiller and I would look to the
 
09:08:58.068 --> 09:08:58.078 align:start position:0%
chair to say you know who's making the
 
09:09:02.030 --> 09:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
of who's making that uh motion who's
 
09:09:07.368 --> 09:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
seconding it and not a sign ahead it's
 
09:09:09.772 --> 09:09:09.782 align:start position:0%
very it's been appalling or it's very
 
09:09:12.112 --> 09:09:12.122 align:start position:0%
frustrating watching it and that's why I
 
09:09:15.170 --> 09:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
had to jump like that and that's
 
09:09:18.670 --> 09:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
it I'm I'm just like I'm just fifth term
 
09:09:22.068 --> 09:09:22.078 align:start position:0%
and this is my first time on this
 
09:09:25.510 --> 09:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm just shaking my head
 
09:09:28.130 --> 09:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
is there a 40 year to comment
 
09:09:31.490 --> 09:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair I'm wondering wondering if
 
09:09:35.330 --> 09:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
members are being muted um
 
09:09:38.208 --> 09:09:38.218 align:start position:0%
a couple of my members have reported to
 
09:09:40.310 --> 09:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
me that they TR we're trying to speak
 
09:09:42.470 --> 09:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
they hadn't muted themselves
 
09:09:45.228 --> 09:09:45.238 align:start position:0%
and they were not they were muted and
 
09:09:46.612 --> 09:09:46.622 align:start position:0%
they hadn't done it themselves and I'm
 
09:09:50.208 --> 09:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
wondering is muting being done
 
09:09:55.790 --> 09:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
by people in the room there with you
 
09:10:00.228 --> 09:10:00.238 align:start position:0%
uh any uh any co-host or uh
 
09:10:03.228 --> 09:10:03.238 align:start position:0%
yeah our Tech advisors also have the
 
09:10:07.248 --> 09:10:07.258 align:start position:0%
ability to mute uh and if someone is
 
09:10:10.310 --> 09:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
speaking out of turn uh then that's when
 
09:10:12.708 --> 09:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh they might be muted when they're not
 
09:10:15.228 --> 09:10:15.238 align:start position:0%
properly recognized by the chair Mr
 
09:10:16.908 --> 09:10:16.918 align:start position:0%
chair um and again I brought this
 
09:10:19.310 --> 09:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
forward to the clerk and I'm waiting his
 
09:10:19.320 --> 09:10:20.868 align:start position:0%
forward to the clerk and I'm waiting his
answer

09:10:20.868 --> 09:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
answer
 
09:10:24.290 --> 09:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that someone who's running
 
09:10:27.588 --> 09:10:27.598 align:start position:0%
the computer has the authority to mute
 
09:10:29.868 --> 09:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
someone because they think that person
 
09:10:32.748 --> 09:10:32.758 align:start position:0%
is speaking out of turn I believe that
 
09:10:35.568 --> 09:10:35.578 align:start position:0%
that is the responsibility of the chair
 
09:10:38.208 --> 09:10:38.218 align:start position:0%
and unless the clerk has gotten back to
 
09:10:40.548 --> 09:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
you with an answer to my question he has
 
09:10:42.950 --> 09:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
not gotten back to me with the answer to
 
09:10:47.088 --> 09:10:47.098 align:start position:0%
my question so I I'm real I'm I'm just
 
09:10:50.810 --> 09:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
asking that we not be muted by anybody
 
09:10:52.728 --> 09:10:52.738 align:start position:0%
unless you
 
09:10:56.030 --> 09:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
please say please mute representative
 
09:10:58.310 --> 09:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
treeleven please mute representative
 
09:11:00.588 --> 09:11:00.598 align:start position:0%
Porter because
 
09:11:02.272 --> 09:11:02.282 align:start position:0%
I don't think another member of the
 
09:11:04.190 --> 09:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee has the right to decide that
 
09:11:05.810 --> 09:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking out of turn
 
09:11:08.748 --> 09:11:08.758 align:start position:0%
that's right uh is there
 
09:11:12.548 --> 09:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
09:11:16.130 --> 09:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
nice chair and
 
09:11:18.290 --> 09:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
I I was not going to bring this up I
 
09:11:20.810 --> 09:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about it really but
 
09:11:23.950 --> 09:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
um people just blur it out
 
09:11:27.112 --> 09:11:27.122 align:start position:0%
and debate with the people in the
 
09:11:31.310 --> 09:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
hearing so I I have mentioned that you
 
09:11:36.310 --> 09:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
09:11:40.190 --> 09:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's it you want to follow up
 
09:11:42.228 --> 09:11:42.238 align:start position:0%
as you raise your hand whatever we have
 
09:11:44.150 --> 09:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
a system here that works
 
09:11:46.310 --> 09:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
and and you raise your hand you'll be
 
09:11:48.708 --> 09:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
recognized uh but there'll be no more
 
09:11:51.112 --> 09:11:51.122 align:start position:0%
blurting out answers or anything like
 
09:11:53.272 --> 09:11:53.282 align:start position:0%
that I was appalled at some of the
 
09:11:55.850 --> 09:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
things that I had seen so far in this
 
09:11:55.860 --> 09:11:57.350 align:start position:0%
things that I had seen so far in this
committee

09:11:57.350 --> 09:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
09:12:00.112 --> 09:12:00.122 align:start position:0%
um and I will tell you this it would
 
09:12:03.228 --> 09:12:03.238 align:start position:0%
never have happened last year when uh
 
09:12:06.048 --> 09:12:06.058 align:start position:0%
chair constant was here
 
09:12:08.928 --> 09:12:08.938 align:start position:0%
he would not tolerate that you had to
 
09:12:11.330 --> 09:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and it and if he decided
 
09:12:14.088 --> 09:12:14.098 align:start position:0%
to recognize you then you spoke if he
 
09:12:16.190 --> 09:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
didn't decide to not recognize you you
 
09:12:18.530 --> 09:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
didn't speak that's exactly it
 
09:12:20.510 --> 09:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Piemonte and that is the
 
09:12:23.690 --> 09:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
chair's prerogative it is not another
 
09:12:26.272 --> 09:12:26.282 align:start position:0%
member of the committee's prerogative to
 
09:12:28.068 --> 09:12:28.078 align:start position:0%
say that that is the chair's
 
09:12:30.350 --> 09:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility so if the chair does not
 
09:12:32.330 --> 09:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
want us to speak out then the chair
 
09:12:34.548 --> 09:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
needs to say that but I don't think it's
 
09:12:37.068 --> 09:12:37.078 align:start position:0%
right for another member of the
 
09:12:39.888 --> 09:12:39.898 align:start position:0%
committee to mute me or you or anybody
 
09:12:42.170 --> 09:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
else because they are making the
 
09:12:44.868 --> 09:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
Judgment that is up to the chair to make
 
09:12:46.908 --> 09:12:46.918 align:start position:0%
okay I don't want to get into an
 
09:12:49.310 --> 09:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
argument here about this uh I I will say
 
09:12:54.170 --> 09:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
that uh I will ask people to uh please
 
09:12:56.150 --> 09:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
wait to be recognized if you have a
 
09:12:59.030 --> 09:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
point of order or if you have or more
 
09:13:00.470 --> 09:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
importantly if you have a follow-up
 
09:13:00.480 --> 09:13:01.510 align:start position:0%
importantly if you have a follow-up
question

09:13:01.510 --> 09:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
09:13:05.388 --> 09:13:05.398 align:start position:0%
I really need to direct that indication
 
09:13:08.990 --> 09:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
to the chair throughout this so far here
 
09:13:11.748 --> 09:13:11.758 align:start position:0%
we are getting to the middle of March I
 
09:13:15.408 --> 09:13:15.418 align:start position:0%
have never denied anybody a follow-up if
 
09:13:16.790 --> 09:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
you've asked for a follow-up you've got
 
09:13:19.310 --> 09:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
one even in some cases
 
09:13:21.650 --> 09:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
and today for example we had a long
 
09:13:24.190 --> 09:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
discussion one of our bills I I have one
 
09:13:28.670 --> 09:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh one individual that I believe asked
 
09:13:32.450 --> 09:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
like 16 or 17 questions and uh but
 
09:13:33.490 --> 09:13:33.500 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
09:13:36.112 --> 09:13:36.122 align:start position:0%
and as long as it's done appropriately
 
09:13:40.010 --> 09:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
and respectfully I I will uh will allow
 
09:13:42.048 --> 09:13:42.058 align:start position:0%
it so
 
09:13:44.568 --> 09:13:44.578 align:start position:0%
please don't take advantage I'll ask you
 
09:13:46.310 --> 09:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
not to take advantage of I could
 
09:13:49.670 --> 09:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
normally good nature but let's just try
 
09:13:52.850 --> 09:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
to please be respectful and and uh and I
 
09:13:54.228 --> 09:13:54.238 align:start position:0%
think everything should go fine
 
09:13:54.238 --> 09:13:57.048 align:start position:0%
think everything should go fine
representative

09:13:57.048 --> 09:13:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
09:13:59.568 --> 09:13:59.578 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think this speaks
 
09:14:01.368 --> 09:14:01.378 align:start position:0%
to what I was trying to say earlier in
 
09:14:03.470 --> 09:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
regards to recognition of those of us
 
09:14:06.530 --> 09:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
who are remote versus recognition of
 
09:14:09.530 --> 09:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
those folks who are together in the lob
 
09:14:11.568 --> 09:14:11.578 align:start position:0%
and I got to tell you I'm 100 jealous
 
09:14:15.228 --> 09:14:15.238 align:start position:0%
I'd love to be there with all y'all the
 
09:14:18.048 --> 09:14:18.058 align:start position:0%
point is it's difficult to run with this
 
09:14:20.208 --> 09:14:20.218 align:start position:0%
technology and I have seen more than
 
09:14:20.218 --> 09:14:21.290 align:start position:0%
technology and I have seen more than
once

09:14:21.290 --> 09:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
once
 
09:14:22.970 --> 09:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
in the entire time that we've been
 
09:14:24.350 --> 09:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
meeting somebody's sitting there with
 
09:14:27.772 --> 09:14:27.782 align:start position:0%
their hand up and you don't see it
 
09:14:29.630 --> 09:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
you're just one person if I was in the
 
09:14:31.368 --> 09:14:31.378 align:start position:0%
room you know I could have my hand in
 
09:14:32.928 --> 09:14:32.938 align:start position:0%
front of you but I don't
 
09:14:35.928 --> 09:14:35.938 align:start position:0%
so there's got to be a balance a measure
 
09:14:38.208 --> 09:14:38.218 align:start position:0%
and some help from
 
09:14:39.708 --> 09:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
09:14:42.350 --> 09:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
to help recognize one another and I
 
09:14:43.490 --> 09:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
think that's a big part of where the
 
09:14:46.908 --> 09:14:46.918 align:start position:0%
frustration comes from yes I I uh I
 
09:14:48.530 --> 09:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
understand that in fact there's been
 
09:14:50.330 --> 09:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
some complaints of those who are in the
 
09:14:52.790 --> 09:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
LLB that I'm not recognizing them when
 
09:14:55.428 --> 09:14:55.438 align:start position:0%
they have the hand up in fact you you uh
 
09:14:59.272 --> 09:14:59.282 align:start position:0%
you actually uh it was uh kind of a joke
 
09:15:00.830 --> 09:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
but one of our members brought a little
 
09:15:02.810 --> 09:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
bell a little pow balance so that I
 
09:15:04.790 --> 09:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
would we put his hand up I would hear
 
09:15:08.030 --> 09:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
him uh and because I wasn't recognizing
 
09:15:11.088 --> 09:15:11.098 align:start position:0%
everybody that had their hand up so this
 
09:15:13.970 --> 09:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
I will tell you it's extremely difficult
 
09:15:17.030 --> 09:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
to manage a zoom meeting that's that's
 
09:15:20.170 --> 09:15:20.180 align:start position:0%
Blended like this half in half in person
 
09:15:24.470 --> 09:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
and half on the computer for uh 20
 
09:15:27.170 --> 09:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
people it's it's very challenging and so
 
09:15:29.330 --> 09:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh please bear with me I'm doing the

even-handed
 
09:15:35.868 --> 09:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
and uh uh and like I said like I told
 
09:15:37.790 --> 09:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
one of one of you I'm trying to call
 
09:15:39.290 --> 09:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
balls and Strikes here without being
 
09:15:40.908 --> 09:15:40.918 align:start position:0%
partial one way or the other
 
09:15:44.748 --> 09:15:44.758 align:start position:0%
 
09:15:48.650 --> 09:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman thank you very much uh I
 
09:15:51.888 --> 09:15:51.898 align:start position:0%
have to go be chairman of the planning
 
09:15:51.898 --> 09:15:53.388 align:start position:0%
have to go be chairman of the planning
board

09:15:53.388 --> 09:15:53.398 align:start position:0%
board
 
09:15:56.388 --> 09:15:56.398 align:start position:0%
um do we have any further work to do I
 
09:15:58.490 --> 09:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
will tell them to start without me if we
 
09:16:01.310 --> 09:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
do otherwise I should probably go yeah
 
09:16:03.228 --> 09:16:03.238 align:start position:0%
but one quickie
 
09:16:06.888 --> 09:16:06.898 align:start position:0%
okay what is it uh it's House Bill 132
 
09:16:08.810 --> 09:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
which I thought we were done with but
 
09:16:11.350 --> 09:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
I'm told that that we didn't finish it
 
09:16:15.588 --> 09:16:15.598 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh it's the one about acreage
 
09:16:17.450 --> 09:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
for single-family housing that
 
09:16:20.868 --> 09:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative uh sponsored and I
 
09:16:24.888 --> 09:16:24.898 align:start position:0%
thought we gained it our itl to uh you
 
09:16:27.290 --> 09:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
IPL it because I that was a bill that I
 
09:16:29.350 --> 09:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
supported and was one of the sponsors of
 
09:16:36.190 --> 09:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
09:16:38.888 --> 09:16:38.898 align:start position:0%
okay so I have an indication from our
 
09:16:41.330 --> 09:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
clerk that it was it's still an open
 
09:16:43.970 --> 09:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
Action so uh if if you're all confident
 
09:16:45.708 --> 09:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
that we already itl did it then we don't
 
09:16:47.388 --> 09:16:47.398 align:start position:0%
have to revisit again I was just going
 
09:16:51.170 --> 09:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
to call another vote on it but uh
 
09:16:52.850 --> 09:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
if you you'll probably have a better
 
09:16:55.068 --> 09:16:55.078 align:start position:0%
memory than I do so I'll take I'll take
 
09:16:57.708 --> 09:16:57.718 align:start position:0%
that as a uh that you're confirming that
 
09:16:59.388 --> 09:16:59.398 align:start position:0%
we did it
 
09:17:02.088 --> 09:17:02.098 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
09:17:04.272 --> 09:17:04.282 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
09:17:07.088 --> 09:17:07.098 align:start position:0%
I I don't know
 
09:17:10.150 --> 09:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
the report on that though the majority
 
09:17:14.030 --> 09:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
majority report Mr chairman I have that
 
09:17:20.650 --> 09:17:20.660 align:start position:0%
 
09:17:23.990 --> 09:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
I had retain or itl and I I didn't
 
09:17:26.630 --> 09:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
indicate in my notes which one we did
 
09:17:28.790 --> 09:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
maybe that's
 
09:17:31.670 --> 09:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
I have retained 18 to one
 
09:17:34.748 --> 09:17:34.758 align:start position:0%

anyone else confirm that representative
 
09:17:45.248 --> 09:17:45.258 align:start position:0%
 
09:17:48.170 --> 09:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
yeah I had I had I have a spreadsheet
 
09:17:49.490 --> 09:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
that I keep track of the bills and I
 
09:17:50.928 --> 09:17:50.938 align:start position:0%
have a note in there that we retained it
 
09:17:53.630 --> 09:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
but I didn't write down the vote 18 to 1
 
09:17:55.728 --> 09:17:55.738 align:start position:0%
is what I'm hearing from
 
09:17:57.700 --> 09:17:57.710 align:start position:0%
more than one person so
 
09:17:57.710 --> 09:17:59.112 align:start position:0%
more than one person so
[Music]

09:17:59.112 --> 09:17:59.122 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
09:18:01.612 --> 09:18:01.622 align:start position:0%
do we know who
 
09:18:03.888 --> 09:18:03.898 align:start position:0%
let me say because representative Porter
 
09:18:07.150 --> 09:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
that voted not to retain is that right
 
09:18:09.588 --> 09:18:09.598 align:start position:0%
if we have
 
09:18:11.450 --> 09:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
um a retention and it was I think
 
09:18:13.130 --> 09:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher who voted
 
09:18:15.408 --> 09:18:15.418 align:start position:0%
against retaining it I I voted against
 
09:18:16.970 --> 09:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
you saying it because I thought we
 
09:18:19.548 --> 09:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
should ought to pass it okay back to you
 
09:18:21.290 --> 09:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative band it looks like we're
 
09:18:21.300 --> 09:18:22.728 align:start position:0%
representative band it looks like we're
done

09:18:22.728 --> 09:18:22.738 align:start position:0%

09:18:26.568 --> 09:18:26.578 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for recognizing me um I
 
09:18:28.490 --> 09:18:28.500 align:start position:0%

09:18:36.650 --> 09:18:36.660 align:start position:0%

it takes time for people to unmute
 
09:20:00.416 --> 09:20:03.170 align:start position:0%
it takes time for people to unmute
themselves

09:20:03.170 --> 09:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
09:20:06.530 --> 09:20:06.540 align:start position:0%

was unable to unmute herself I you know
 
09:20:21.110 --> 09:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that you know impediment there
 
09:20:25.670 --> 09:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
in trying to click to unmute oneself in
 
09:20:28.490 --> 09:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
order to make a motion and
 
09:20:33.710 --> 09:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
again I did not mute anybody for those
 
09:20:37.490 --> 09:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
reasons so it's not clear to me
 
09:20:37.500 --> 09:20:38.990 align:start position:0%
reasons so it's not clear to me
um

09:20:38.990 --> 09:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:20:41.210 --> 09:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
representative Porter was referring to
 
09:20:42.950 --> 09:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
but I would like every Committee Member
 
09:20:46.310 --> 09:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
to know and to understand that I did not
 
09:20:49.246 --> 09:20:49.256 align:start position:0%
mute anybody uh I I also have thank you
 
09:20:50.990 --> 09:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative power I just know that
 
09:20:53.210 --> 09:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
several several people were trying to
 
09:20:55.550 --> 09:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
talk and they weren't being heard and
 
09:20:57.230 --> 09:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
they don't know how they were muted and
 
09:20:59.450 --> 09:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
maybe it was a glitch today with the
 
09:21:01.190 --> 09:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
technology we seem to have a lot of them
 
09:21:04.310 --> 09:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to make that I also as
 
09:21:06.170 --> 09:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
a co-host I have the ability to mute
 
09:21:08.510 --> 09:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
people as well and to take their hands
 
09:21:10.730 --> 09:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
and put they're up to put them down I
 
09:21:12.230 --> 09:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
can tell you I didn't mute anybody today
 
09:21:15.950 --> 09:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
but I just hands down uh you sometimes
 
09:21:18.530 --> 09:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
have that situation where someone asks a
 
09:21:20.510 --> 09:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
question and their hand is up and it
 
09:21:22.370 --> 09:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
stays up and I end up going back to that
 
09:21:23.870 --> 09:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
person and say you have a question and
 
09:21:26.150 --> 09:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
say no no my hand is up from a previous
 
09:21:28.310 --> 09:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
question so when when I call on somebody
 
09:21:30.530 --> 09:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
like if representative Gilman has a
 
09:21:32.390 --> 09:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
question and her hand is up electronic
 
09:21:35.210 --> 09:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
hand the little yellow and sticks up I
 
09:21:38.150 --> 09:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
can click on her face and I can put her
 
09:21:41.150 --> 09:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
hand down once I recognize her so that
 
09:21:44.210 --> 09:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
her hand doesn't stay up so that that's
 
09:21:46.610 --> 09:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
what I do I haven't muted anybody uh yet
 
09:21:49.070 --> 09:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
this year okay thank you

09:22:31.906 --> 09:22:31.916 align:start position:0%
right now the only thing I have the
 
09:22:34.390 --> 09:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
ability to do is mute and rename myself
 
09:22:38.510 --> 09:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
those are the only things that I I can
 
09:22:41.210 --> 09:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
do at this moment earlier I had the
 
09:22:43.190 --> 09:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
ability to raise hand and then it was
 
09:22:45.530 --> 09:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
gone again so again I think it's a
 
09:22:48.650 --> 09:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
glitch with the system I don't know why
 
09:22:51.766 --> 09:22:51.776 align:start position:0%
um but I think it at times these are
 
09:22:53.030 --> 09:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
some of the things that are happening to
 
09:22:55.370 --> 09:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
us yes it was one of the reasons why
 
09:22:57.710 --> 09:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
those of us who are trying to manage our
 
09:23:00.950 --> 09:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
way through this this period of time are
 
09:23:03.070 --> 09:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
very frustrated with the technology
 
09:23:05.690 --> 09:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
because it's not smooth it's a very
 
09:23:09.406 --> 09:23:09.416 align:start position:0%
bumpy and uh it's very difficult to
 
09:23:11.990 --> 09:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
manage and and try to be fair to
 
09:23:15.050 --> 09:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
everybody because it it can it can give
 
09:23:17.926 --> 09:23:17.936 align:start position:0%
the appearance sometimes of unfairness
 
09:23:20.630 --> 09:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
or at least uneven application of our
 
09:23:24.650 --> 09:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
process so we're trying and we have we
 
09:23:27.230 --> 09:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
have staff here to help us and we had we
 
09:23:29.570 --> 09:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
had a half hour delay today when we
 
09:23:31.610 --> 09:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
tried to reboot the computer and it uh
 
09:23:34.010 --> 09:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
and I think we may have done more damage
 
09:23:35.690 --> 09:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
they had to bring a new computer in to
 
09:23:37.730 --> 09:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
get us back up live for this exact
 
09:23:40.790 --> 09:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
session so uh we're we're working on it
 
09:23:42.530 --> 09:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
I think I think we're doing okay I mean
 
09:23:45.426 --> 09:23:45.436 align:start position:0%
given given the the Blended technology
 
09:23:49.190 --> 09:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh it would it's uh it is a challenge
 
09:23:50.570 --> 09:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative Powell he had something
 
09:23:54.470 --> 09:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
else they I um suggest to representative
 
09:23:56.690 --> 09:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
plea that you might want to try
 
09:23:56.700 --> 09:23:57.370 align:start position:0%
plea that you might want to try
um

09:23:57.370 --> 09:23:57.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:24:00.170 --> 09:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
re-installing or downloading Zoom that
 
09:24:02.630 --> 09:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
might alleviate the problem
 
09:24:05.510 --> 09:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps I I could possibly
 
09:24:08.390 --> 09:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
um re-download it but I just upgraded it
 
09:24:10.246 --> 09:24:10.256 align:start position:0%
last week I don't think there's a new
 
09:24:11.570 --> 09:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
upgrade to it
 
09:24:14.390 --> 09:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to to to do that
 
09:24:16.070 --> 09:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't know voice because I asked
 
09:24:18.170 --> 09:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
Christine to change my name
 
09:24:20.086 --> 09:24:20.096 align:start position:0%
um friends call me Trish but my actual
 
09:24:22.790 --> 09:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
name is Patricia and I would prefer that
 
09:24:24.830 --> 09:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
to be on the screen and that suddenly
 
09:24:26.690 --> 09:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
she had changed it and then suddenly it
 
09:24:29.086 --> 09:24:29.096 align:start position:0%
disappeared so I don't know if this is
 
09:24:30.710 --> 09:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
09:24:32.870 --> 09:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
um the glitch that I was
 
09:24:36.470 --> 09:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
um that that kind of um
 
09:24:39.890 --> 09:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
messed things up so to speak but um I I
 
09:24:41.630 --> 09:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
will ask at the beginning of each
 
09:24:43.610 --> 09:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
meeting to have my name check changed to
 
09:24:46.010 --> 09:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
Patricia because that is my name so it
 
09:24:47.330 --> 09:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
could have been something as simple as
 
09:24:49.426 --> 09:24:49.436 align:start position:0%
that well we've lost about half the
 
09:24:51.406 --> 09:24:51.416 align:start position:0%
committee but I'm happy to say that I
 
09:24:54.050 --> 09:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
believe that uh with the exception of
 
09:24:55.426 --> 09:24:55.436 align:start position:0%
some of these committee reports that
 
09:24:57.110 --> 09:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
need to be finalized I think we're going
 
09:24:59.630 --> 09:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
to be done uh for about three weeks or
 
09:25:02.746 --> 09:25:02.756 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm hearing a rumor that we may
 
09:25:04.730 --> 09:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
have a General Session sometime around
 
09:25:07.426 --> 09:25:07.436 align:start position:0%
the first week of April uh but the
 
09:25:10.906 --> 09:25:10.916 align:start position:0%
details aren't known yet and I think the
 
09:25:12.530 --> 09:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
venue is going to be the same as the
 
09:25:15.950 --> 09:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
last one and that the indoor arena so
 
09:25:18.406 --> 09:25:18.416 align:start position:0%
thank you so you can take some time off
 
09:25:21.230 --> 09:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and please help me get those
 
09:25:23.390 --> 09:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
committee reports done or else the the
 
09:25:26.766 --> 09:25:26.776 align:start position:0%
legislation won't go through uh properly
 
09:25:29.990 --> 09:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
so go Mr chairman I'll let you go
 
09:25:30.000 --> 09:25:31.970 align:start position:0%
