30 minutes for uh an orientation
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
um we sent out a pretty lengthy few
 
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
sheets of paper
 
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
um kind of giving the expectations of
 
00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
the committee for this for this term
 
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
um and My Hope was that everybody's had
 
00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 align:start position:0%
a chance to read
 
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
that understand that and then if we had
 
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
any excuse me any questions on that we
 
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
could go over that uh in this first 30
 
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.289 align:start position:0%
could go over that uh in this first 30
minutes

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
so first of all did everybody get a copy
 
00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
or did anybody not get a copy of that
 
00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
okay that was sent via an email from
 
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
Heather if you didn't get it
 
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.830 align:start position:0%
Heather if you didn't get it
um

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
make sure you do get it so you can go
 
00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
over it so we we're all on the same page
 
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
going forward for the term
 
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
going forward for the term
um

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 align:start position:0%
did anybody have any specific questions
 
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
regarding the what we sent out and then
 
00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 align:start position:0%
I've got some additional notes after we
 
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
sent that out of course I thought of a
 
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
bunch of things we forgot and uh
 
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
Vice chair power has some comments also
 
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
so were there any comments or questions
 
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.610 align:start position:0%
so were there any comments or questions
on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I have a question
 
00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:46.970 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I have a question
about

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 align:start position:0%
um scheduling executive sessions yes
 
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that in this term
 
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
um it is your prerogative to schedule an
 
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
executive session but it has to be with
 
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
the concurrence of the ranking member
 
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct so if we could work at
 
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
some point work out a process that feels
 
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable to both of us for that that
 
00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 align:start position:0%
might be productive that's fine
 
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
um as of right now just say I'm kind of
 
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
getting into a couple comments that I
 
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to make at the end of today
 
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.009 align:start position:0%
we're going to make at the end of today
but

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned in the opening we have
 
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 align:start position:0%
a very very busy schedule coming up this
 
00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:25.790 align:start position:0%
a very very busy schedule coming up this
term

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
we're already at I think 46 bills and
 
00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 align:start position:0%
that's going to probably climb north of
 
00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.869 align:start position:0%
that's going to probably climb north of
80.

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
80.
 
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
in this packet I mentioned that there
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
might be a need for more than one day a
 
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
week and I can already tell you next
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
week we're going to be doing two days so
 
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
plan on next Wednesday uh similar to
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
today where we'll be going over a number
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
of bills that that will be posted today
 
00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 align:start position:0%
and then on Thursday we will either do
 
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 align:start position:0%
an entire day of
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
exacting or
 
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.270 align:start position:0%
exacting or
um

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
a half day of exec executive session and
 
00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
municipal and County government
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
committee my name is rep Josh adgerton
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
from Enfield and I'm here to introduce
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
hb70 a bill that would expand the job
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
pool for Deputy Town clerks and clarify
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
a confusing statute this bill came to
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
fruition after a conversation I had with
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
enfield's Town manager Ed Morris who
 
00:30:03.889 --> 00:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
joins us today in November
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
the town of Enfield sought legal advice
 
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
about whether a deputy town clerk had to
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
be a resident of the Town obtained
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
advice that they did not appointed a
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
non-resident and then learned from the
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state that the secretary's
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the statutes was that
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
the deputy had to be a resident while
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
the town was provided a workaround it
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
would be good to prevent this in the
 
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
future and we can do that with this bill
 
00:30:27.769 --> 00:30:27.779 align:start position:0%
I will first speak to the statutory
 
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
confusion I know that attorney Grace
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
from the municipal Association has a
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
letter outlining one of the major issues
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
at root here
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
RSA 41 colon 48 says quote a deputy town
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
clerk must be qualified in the same
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
manner as a town clerk meaning they must
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
be domiciled within the town however RSA
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
669 colon 65 says essentially should a
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
town clerk no longer be town clerk the
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
selectman will make an appointment
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
unless there is a deputy town clerk but
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
only if the deputy town clerk lives in
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
the town which begs the question how can
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
an out-of-town Deputy town clerk get to
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
be Deputy town clerk if they must be
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
similarly qualified initially as the
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
town clerk put simply 41 suggests the
 
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:16.340 align:start position:0%
deputy town clerk must be a resident
 
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
669-65 suggests they don't have to be
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
at a minimum it would save a lot of
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
headaches for the committee to use this
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill as a vehicle to clarify that
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
language so towns know what the rules
 
00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
are and the nhma will speak to that
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
speaking now to the merits of the
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
language here I think this legislation
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
has several clear benefits
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
per the most recent census data the
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
number of New Hampshire municipalities
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
with populations under 500 is 17. if
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
residency is a requirement the odds of
 
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
finding a qualified person to serve as
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
Deputy town clerk in a community the
 
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
size of Easton or Benton versus Bedford
 
00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:54.419 align:start position:0%
and Londonderry are vastly different
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
smaller communities could benefit from
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
this kind of flexibility
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
this is an important adjustment to make
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
due to the necessity of town clerks in
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire should a town
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
clerk resign or pass away there must be
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
somebody available to assume the
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the job until the
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
next town meeting and that should be the
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
deputy town clerk as they are the person
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
with the most familiarity of their
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
specific Municipal needs
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not recommending that we alter the
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
requirement of residency for Town clerks
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
nor is nhma or any other testifier that
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
in order of preference I am asking that
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
the committee passed this bill that
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
would allow smaller communities the
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find Qualified and
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
capable Deputy Town clerks who may live
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
in adjacent communities or at the very
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
least clean up and reduce confusion
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
within the statutes and that's all I
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
have I can take any questions
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.190 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
questions

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
representative treleman
 
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
option in my head so I'm going to ask it
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
as a question the Assumption I'm making
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
is that when the law was
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
put in place and or written uh the world
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
was very different and our communication
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
was very different and for somebody to
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
learn about a town and its residence you
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
had to be there
 
00:33:21.529 --> 00:33:21.539 align:start position:0%
again my assumption is that these days
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily have to be there
 
00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
all the time to adequately serve a town
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
in elected in a appointed position and
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
understand how the community Works what
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
do you think about that
 
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
I would actually ask
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
when nhma testifies that they answer
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
that because there was a revision to the
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
rsas in the early 2000s that created
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
this kind of
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
um confusion it seems as if one part of
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
the RSA was amended while the other part
 
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.690 align:start position:0%
the RSA was amended while the other part
wasn't

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I don't 100 percent
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
I can't speak with certain confidence as
 
00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:00.419 align:start position:0%
to which way that went but I know in my
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
conversations with attorney Grace that
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
came up so I would ask that he answered
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
that when he comes up great thank you
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative Powell thank you Mr
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
chairman so my question
 
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
um pertains to the notion that
 
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.369 align:start position:0%
um pertains to the notion that
um

00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:19.820 align:start position:0%
you testified that the change to this
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
statute here would expand the job pool
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
in communities that that are smaller
 
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.510 align:start position:0%
in communities that that are smaller
um

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
my town that I reside in is Brookline it
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
is a Border Town
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
does this legislation or as the prime
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor have you considered
 
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.669 align:start position:0%
sponsor have you considered
um

00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
the possibility of
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
um a deputy Deputy town clerk coming
 
00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
from out of state is that addressed in
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation and what are your
 
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.270 align:start position:0%
this legislation and what are your
thoughts

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's not specifically said no to
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
um however if an amendment were to be
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
drafted that would clarify that it would
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
need to be a New Hampshire resident a
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of part of the answer
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
part of the question was uh
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative Powers asked and would
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
this address the need for us to have the
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
workforce having such a acute shortage
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to recruit people
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
to serve in these positions would this
 
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.450 align:start position:0%
to serve in these positions would this
address

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you speak a
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
little bit to um
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
lines 9 through 14 uh with respect to
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
the town clerk position
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I think I understand the changes that
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
you're seeking in the existing
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
legislation here
 
00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:11.339 align:start position:0%
and they pertain to should this become
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
law a deputy town clerk who is not
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
domiciled in the town could in some
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances serve as town clerk
 
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
if that position became vacant is that
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to accomplish here or
 
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
is it something different no it would be
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
allowing the deputy town clerk to assume
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of town clerk until
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
the next town meeting
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
um that would be the parameters there I
 
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:38.780 align:start position:0%
will say as a disclaimer that
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
Municipal and Deputy town clerk
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
residency laws are not my wheelhouse uh
 
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.829 align:start position:0%
residency laws are not my wheelhouse uh
so

00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I will do the best I can to answer
 
00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
some of the more Cosmic questions
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
surrounding the rsas
 
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
um but though that conflagration between
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
the two not necessarily saying the same
 
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.069 align:start position:0%
the two not necessarily saying the same
thing

00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
um is where I'm the most familiar right
 
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.890 align:start position:0%
um is where I'm the most familiar right
now

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:02.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative yukela thank you thank
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
um since the change does not
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
um address the requirement that town
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
clerks be domicide domiciled in the town
 
00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:24.170 align:start position:0%
clerks be domicide domiciled in the town
how

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.670 align:start position:0%
how
could

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.569 align:start position:0%
could
um

00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:28.430 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
um appoint someone who is not qualified
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative can you repeat the
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
question so since their qualifications
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
require domicile in the town if for
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
Deputy Town Clerk or no for the actual
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
moves out of town is no longer qualified
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
and now the deputy needs to come in and
 
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
fill that role but they're also not
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
domiciled in that town
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's no one kind of like
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
for the Selectmen to that meet the
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
qualification of town clerk to be
 
00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:15.950 align:start position:0%
qualification of town clerk to be
um

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
to be appointed that that's what this
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
legislation seeks to clarify I'm trying
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
to make it so that in the instance first
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
of all that a deputy town clerk could be
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
from an adjacent community and then
 
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
following that in the absence of a
 
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
regular town clerk the deputy town clerk
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
could assume those responsibilities that
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
is what I'm hoping to enable with this
 
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.670 align:start position:0%
is what I'm hoping to enable with this
legislation

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:50.650 align:start position:0%
legislation
foreign

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:50.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
for taking yet another question
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about the article that I
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
read yesterday in the Concord Monitor
 
00:38:59.569 --> 00:38:59.579 align:start position:0%
about a school board member who became
 
00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:01.069 align:start position:0%
about a school board member who became
houseless

00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
houseless
 
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
and was ousted from her position on the
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
school board because she could no longer
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
find a place to stay
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
in the ward that she represented and I
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
wondered if you might be amenable or
 
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
others might think it not a bad idea to
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
change the word domicile
 
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
to something else
 
00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
like reside in or something like that
 
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
because domicile
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
implies to me that someone has a home
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
in that town
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
and we are seeing more and more across
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
this state that people are being
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
having to leave their home through no
 
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
fault of their own
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
so just it's just a shading of the word
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm just you know throwing it out
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
if the committee supported that then
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I would support that but I don't know
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
how that would conflict with other
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
definitions within RSA and I would want
 
00:39:57.609 --> 00:39:57.619 align:start position:0%
to be cautious about
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
I think I'm following up on on what uh
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
representative yokello might have been
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
asking does this
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
I thought I understood it clearly does
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
does this bill then essentially Grant a
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
deputy town clerk who is not domiciled
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
in the town and and assuming that role
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
the kind of leniency or or or whatever
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
until someone else can be appointed so
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to fill that
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
capacity of living in the town I didn't
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
state that question accurately I'm sorry
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
I think they would just be serving as an
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
acting town clerk acting town clerk
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's I think where I'm trying to go
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative so
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
sectioned um you know 41 18 and 669
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
colon 65 in in concert
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
the language is very confusing and
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
um so my question is
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
Mike let's see my copy here
 
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
I guess 10 through 11. so the question
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
pertaining to lines 10 through 11 it
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
states that
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
um pursuant to RSA 41 colon 18 the
 
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
Selectmen have previously appointed
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
could you explain to me
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's not clear to me the English
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
language and under what circumstances
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
underneath the section dealing with a
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
vacancy that the Selectmen had
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
previously appointed a deputy town clerk
 
00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:02.900 align:start position:0%
I believe that would pertain to whether
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
the appointment was almost grandfathered
 
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.650 align:start position:0%
the appointment was almost grandfathered
in

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
I think that speaks to a lot of the root
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
of the confusion here like as I stated
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
in testimony
 
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.690 align:start position:0%
in testimony
um

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:16.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.730 align:start position:0%
um
669.65

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:18.740 align:start position:0%
669.65
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
appears to say that uh or the conflict
 
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
between 669 65 and 41 colon 48 is that
 
00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
the deputy town clerk would have to be
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
similarly qualified as the town clerk
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
however in some
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
magic bait and switch circumstance where
 
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
the deputy town clerk was appointed
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
without residency then they could be
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
appointed except for uh where it was
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
conflicted uh I think our mutual
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
confusion in that statute uh is a good
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
argument for uh cleaning that up because
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
I am similarly confused
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
um yes go ahead just follow up thank you
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up question so I spent a
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of time analyzing
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
this language and I also made a flow
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
chart so I'm thinking that perhaps that
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
word appointed should in fact be
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
approved because the procedure is that a
 
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
deputy town clerk is appointed by the
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
select board I meant by by the town
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
clerk excuse me and then that selection
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
is approved by the selectment so
 
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
um what I would say is this bill still
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
needs some work if I can say that
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:35.339 align:start position:0%
sure and just to answer that
 
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
um as I said I am happy to admit that I
 
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
am not an expert in Municipal law
 
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
um so I would absolutely yield to the
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
accumulative experience of the municipal
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
and County committee to clarify the
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
language in this bill however I will
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
also say that what nhma is going to
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
testify to shortly is that when they
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
communicated and asked Deputy Town
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
clerks and town clerks across the state
 
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire what does this say
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
there was not concrete unanimity in what
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
folks thought it believed and the fact
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
that that confusion exists should in my
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
opinion necessitate a fix to the RSA
 
00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:19.670 align:start position:0%
opinion necessitate a fix to the RSA
um

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
that so I I I I agree with that
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
thank you uh if
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
I could if I could make a suggestion and
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'll let everybody ask as many questions
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
as they are but uh I might suggest that
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we move on to some of the other
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
individuals who are going to testify
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
that might have a little bit more
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
background on the actual language again
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to take more
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
questions but I'd prefer to go on to the
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Edgerton
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh next like to call Deputy Sarah
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Aaron Hennessey
 
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
and I am the deputy secretary of state
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I am here to
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I am here to offer testimony in
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
opposition to this legislation I first
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
want to point out that I
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
um agree with the representative from
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
anfield that the language in the current
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
law is a bit confusing surrounding the
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
deputy clerks
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
um and does need a little bit of Cleanup
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
in my research on this it was what I
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
found out and I'm assuming that the
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
municipal Association can give more
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
information I haven't read their letter
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
yet but
 
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
um that when we when the state addressed
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
this previously
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
much before my time in the state house
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
was that there were some deputies that
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
were not Town residents and the language
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
was written to try and grandfather those
 
00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:04.220 align:start position:0%
deputies in while preventing new deputy
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
appointments from being members of a
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
surrounding town or as the
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative power pointed out perhaps
 
00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:15.140 align:start position:0%
from another state
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
um the Department of State feels that
 
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
it's very important for members of the
 
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
clerk's office that are appointed to be
 
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.809 align:start position:0%
clerk's office that are appointed to be
so

00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
um which would be the deputy
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
and would take over in the absence of
 
00:46:34.329 --> 00:46:34.339 align:start position:0%
the clerk to be members of the town
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
the qualifications for officers of town
 
00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.770 align:start position:0%
the qualifications for officers of town
government

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:38.780 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
under 6696 is that unless otherwise
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
provided by law no person shall hold an
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
elective town office who does not have
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
his domicile within the town so it's
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
very clear that town officers especially
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
the clerk in our opinion should be from
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
that town they um
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
the town clerks handle a lot of personal
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
private information when it comes to DMV
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
records when it comes to election
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
information but it's also really
 
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
important for them since they help to
 
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
run our elections and help handle a lot
 
00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:17.339 align:start position:0%
of our voter information that these
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
people are Town residents that are
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
elected by the town and and are not in
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
any way controlled by anyone else in the
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
town in the town offices such as a town
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
manager or another elected official and
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
if these persons were to be from a
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
different town or appointed by the
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
select board then perhaps they wouldn't
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
be serving their constituents they were
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
elected by I'm assuming that the clerks
 
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:42.380 align:start position:0%
here and
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
anyone who else testifying can give you
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
some more information about the
 
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
importance of that I'm happy to take
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have but I again
 
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
I do agree that the language as
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
currently written is confusing and I
 
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
believe it was because they were trying
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
to grandfather in some deputies back at
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
some point point in the past
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions from
 
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.829 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
um
it

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
to me it's a little confusing
 
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
in paragraph one it states that the
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
the change is that the deputy town clerk
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
did not
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
have his or her domicile in town
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
but under the town clerk
 
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:42.380 align:start position:0%
they required the time clerk which is a
 
00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.970 align:start position:0%
they required the time clerk which is a
constitutional

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
elected position
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
um be from the town you know to be
 
00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:53.180 align:start position:0%
elected so how do you put a non-resident
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
into fill the town clerk's position when
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
they're not their resident
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
I agree thank you for the question
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
and and to your point the clerks are
 
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the New Hampshire
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
constitution in part second article 32.
 
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
let's make a quick reminder uh in the
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
packages that we sent out uh talking
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
about uh how we operate we have a lot a
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
lot of bills so we need to go through
 
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:27.260 align:start position:0%
this term if we can keep our questions
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
to the presenters actual questions for
 
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
furthering information
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
our points of view and our statements
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not picking on you representative
 
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.790 align:start position:0%
I'm not picking on you representative
Tatro

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
Tatro
 
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
um keep them to questions for
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
clarification that will move things
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
along much much quicker any other
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
questions representative Guthrie thank
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
you Mr Chan thank you for taking my
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
question would you agree with me that
 
00:49:59.089 --> 00:49:59.099 align:start position:0%
the uh Deputy town clerk is a very very
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
important position and it's appointed
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
and that uh that
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh if there is nobody qualified in the
 
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
community particularly in the small
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
communities aren't we better to be able
 
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
to go out outside of the community and
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
get somebody qualified to serve in that
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
position of Deputy Clerk then uh become
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
committed to only people in the
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
community what do you do if you have
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
nobody I see this as as a plus
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
uh in the real world the deputy clerk is
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
a very important physician and that
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
person whether they come from the
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
community or not
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
the more important is that they're
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
qualified in and that it's not just
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
somebody in some of the small
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
communities I happen to have had a
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
situation where we lost our town clerk
 
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
and we had a deputy and a deputy served
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
for an a very short period of time
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
because the selectment in the real world
 
00:51:09.049 --> 00:51:09.059 align:start position:0%
make that appointment as fast as they
 
00:51:09.059 --> 00:51:09.950 align:start position:0%
make that appointment as fast as they
can

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
so my question is don't you agree with
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
me that it's more important to get to
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
have a deputy clerk from
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh that's qualified whether they live in
 
00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
before you answer that
 
00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:28.069 align:start position:0%
before you answer that
um

00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
also in the packet representative
 
00:51:33.609 --> 00:51:33.619 align:start position:0%
Guthrie that we we handed out one of the
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
items that I specifically mentioned was
 
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
that we again we need to ask questions
 
00:51:43.569 --> 00:51:43.579 align:start position:0%
rather than uh
 
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
preceding our statement with a would you
 
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
believe again we're looking for
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
clarifications on testimony
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
unless I'm misunderstanding uh
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
Ms Hennessey has stated that she
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
believes that we should probably go back
 
00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.049 align:start position:0%
believes that we should probably go back
to

00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:00.059 --> 00:52:02.569 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
the individuals actually residing
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
everybody residing in the towns and that
 
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
this this was created as a kind of an
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
exception to existing conditions if I
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
have that wrong Miss Hennessy you can
 
00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
correct me uh you're corrected Mr
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um to represent Guthrie's Point
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
nothing in the current legislation
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
prevents a town from hiring assistant
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
clerks that do not reside in the town to
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
help with the operations of the office
 
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:35.390 align:start position:0%

clerk Tax Collectors same person elected
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
is that the way it is in every single
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
Town foolish should be not to know that
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry and maybe you don't
 
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
know that either because I'm

I'm that that's my question okay thank
 
00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:55.940 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
you can have the combined position there
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
is certain legislation that covers that
 
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
I mean in the rsas that covers that
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
however it is not how it is in in every
 
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.710 align:start position:0%
however it is not how it is in in every
town

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
town

thank you for taking the question this
 
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
is kind of following up with my previous
 
00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:17.450 align:start position:0%
is kind of following up with my previous
question

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
um since this does not change
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
669.6 which you previously stated as the
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
requirements for residency for all
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
elected officials and we're not changing
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
the town clerk to not be an elected
 
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.069 align:start position:0%
the town clerk to not be an elected
official

00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
official
 
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
um does this change actually do what
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
um the stated purpose of the bill is
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
which is to allow the Selectmen to
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
appoint someone to the town clerk that
 
00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:45.140 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
a resident of the town or domiciled in
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
the town since they would not meet the
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
qualifications under 669 6.
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yesterday
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
um an appointed non-resident Deputy
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
clerk that assumes the clerk role would
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
not meet the qualifications of the
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks so much um
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
Madame deputy secretary for coming to
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
testify my question is in your mind is
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
there a difference between
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
who might fill in while a clerk was I
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
think you've just answered it though
 
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
while a clerk was not available or moved
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe so but I would have to
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
um I would have to get back to you on
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
that I I I'm assuming based on the
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
language that once they assume that role
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
that they have assumed that position I
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
um under the current uh 4118 it says
 
00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:06.740 align:start position:0%
that each Town may have a deputy clerk
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
if a town that does have a deputy Clerk
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
and the town clerk leaves
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
let's see how what was my question if
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
the position of the Deputy town clerk
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
can't be filled by someone within the
 
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.650 align:start position:0%
can't be filled by someone within the
municipality

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:26.660 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
does the position
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question so the
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
because it
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
um the law stipulates that they may have
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
a deputy town clerk that does not
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
require them to have a town a deputy
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
town clerk so I said as I said
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
previously towns are able to hire
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
assistance as needed to assist the town
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
clerk that are non-residents
 
00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%

I thank you representative I would have

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:41.700 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Ed Morris I'm the
 
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
town manager in the town of Enfield I'm
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
the one that called representative added
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
about this about this bill just wanted
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
to tell you a little bit about what
 
00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.059 align:start position:0%
happened in the town of Enfield so we
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
had a retirement last year our town
 
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
clerk was retiring in December and we
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
had a deputy town clerk that did live in
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
the town that was going to move up into
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
that town clerk position so we we
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
started in September looking for a
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
part-time Deputy town clerk to fill that
 
00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:35.579 align:start position:0%
position they looked hard they
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
advertised and and looked and couldn't
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
find anybody prior to advertising we did
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
work with nhma and they'll talk a little
 
00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
bit and I think it's already been talked
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
about the confusion in the language
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
we were advised that we could hire
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
someone from outside so when they were
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
looking for a part-time Clerk
 
00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
they advertised like we would any other
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
position and looked for three months and
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
was not able to find a part-time Deputy
 
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
town clerk so the the town did what it
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
could and we actually moved the deputy
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
town clerk position to a full-time
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
position with benefits and knowing that
 
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
this was an important position it still
 
00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
took until close to march to find
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
somebody that would fill this position
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
and we ended up finding a resident of
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
rumney New Hampshire that was willing to
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
make the drive about a 40-45 minute
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
drive from her house to Enfield to fill
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
this position
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
she's doing a great job
 
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
learn the skills of the position and
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
worked very hard for the town of Enfield
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
in August coming into the September
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
elections we were notified by the
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that she
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
could not be a deputy town clerk and a
 
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
lot of the vital records and things that
 
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
she had had filled out and helped people
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
marriage licenses those types of things
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
needed to be redone and signed by the
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
Town Clerk and sent back so that was
 
00:59:03.289 --> 00:59:03.299 align:start position:0%
great and then the Secretary of State's
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
office was really helpful they called
 
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
back a day or so later talked to Our
 
00:59:09.289 --> 00:59:09.299 align:start position:0%
Town Clerk and said you know there are
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
towns around the state where this is
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
happening kind of here's the work around
 
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
and they said you know you can get a
 
00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
stamp with the town clerk's name on it
 
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
for the signature and when the town
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
clerk's out of town the assistant town
 
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
clerk can do the paperwork and stamp the
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
signature and send it in or we could
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
deputize a select board member or
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
another member of the staff that was
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
domiciled in town to sign the paperwork
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
in my mind even though they don't really
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
know what they're signing and
 
00:59:37.559 --> 00:59:38.329 align:start position:0%
know what they're signing and
um

00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
to me what I teach my staff is if
 
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
there's a a rule that we're having to
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
figure out a workaround or something to
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
do then we need to go through the proper
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
steps to change that rule and so that's
 
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
why I'm here that's why I called
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant and asked him if
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
he would bring this legislation forward
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
so we can start getting some
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
clarification either clarification on
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
the language
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
the process or how we should do things
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
in the real world as he said this would
 
01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
expand the pool and Fields a town of 4
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
600 people and we had trouble finding a
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
deputy town clerk for almost six months
 
01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:18.140 align:start position:0%
I do think this will affect other towns
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
to work around with the assistant town
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
clerk works but I don't think we should
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
be creating laws to create workarounds
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
and so I would I would hope you guys
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
would support this or at least give it
 
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
good attention moving forward to
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
to present a law that that works for all
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
01:00:40.329 --> 01:00:40.339 align:start position:0%
thank you questions uh representative
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
my question so you had a lived
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
experience in terms of this whole
 
01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:52.700 align:start position:0%
process uh as a town
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
manager was it conflicting to have a
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
task that would be normally done by a
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
city clerk but have the seal but
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
filling in could do it without
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
understanding what they're signing for
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it's
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's a huge problem but
 
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:17.339 align:start position:0%
it's a workaround I mean if the if the
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
lady's competent to sit in and do all of
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
the clerk's work
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't understand why she
 
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
can't sign the document I do get some of
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
the concern if she's trying if the
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
emergency comes up where they need to
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
fill in for the town clerk for a couple
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
months until the town could find
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
somebody to do that job but
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's something that you guys need to
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
talk through and figure out but I know
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
the day-to-day work that the clerks do
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
every day
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
um we need someone in that seat and it
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
would make a lot more sense if the
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
person that took the training and
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
understand how to fill the paper work
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
out could sign the paperwork at the end
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have a couple questions
 
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
for you uh kind of related
 
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
um being the town manager have you ever
 
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
had previous to the last couple years
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
have you ever had
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
issues in filling uh Town Clerk or and
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
Deputy town clerk positions
 
01:02:17.339 --> 01:02:19.010 align:start position:0%
Deputy town clerk positions
uh

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about filling them I mean
 
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
we've had a little bit of trouble I was
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
the city manager in Claremont too much
 
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
bigger city
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
um we did have people there but we kind
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
of did the same work around there in a
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
big city there were times that we
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
deputized my assistant that's on the
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
other side of the building from the
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
clerks and the assistant clerks there
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
that lived outside of town would run
 
01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:41.579 align:start position:0%
across the building over to her office
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
to have her sign a piece of paper so
 
01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
they could send it in to the State House
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
kind of what I was getting at is I know
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years there's been
 
01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.410 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years there's been
a

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
I hate
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
businesses government offices everybody
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
has been having trouble filling
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
positions and my concern a question is
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
do you think that that plays a part in
 
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
not being able to find yeah that that
 
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
absolutely plays a part I mean it's not
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
just the clerk or Deputy Clerk's role we
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
have a a lot of trouble finding
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
government employees
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere just like any other business
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then the requirements and the
 
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
training needs for all of these
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
positions are are getting
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
more and more so it's you know there's a
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
lot of training that needs to go into
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
these positions before people are
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
allowed to to do the work and
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you seeing no other questions
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair nature Grace for the
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
municipal Association I just want to
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
briefly introduce the municipal
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
Association since I know we have a new
 
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.930 align:start position:0%
Association since I know we have a new
committee

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
um so we do three primary things we
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
provide legal advice to cities and towns
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're a voluntary membership
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
organization we currently represent all
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
234 cities and towns so we provide legal
 
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
advice to them as they call us we
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
provide training which is probably our
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
biggest component of what we do last
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
year we had 86 different Education and
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
Training sessions that staff our staff
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
of of nine of which uh five of us
 
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
typically do trainings
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
um performed
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
and those ranged from working with State
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
agencies we took over some training that
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
state agencies had previously done as
 
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
well as independent trainings and
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
training suggested by legislators so
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
certainly if there's anything that's uh
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
that you see as a problem either
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
generally or in your municipality please
 
01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:41.099 align:start position:0%
let me know we're happy to try to work
 
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
with you to address those issues and
 
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
lastly I come here and uh and I talk
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
with all of you about the positions that
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
our members adopt and ask us to advocate
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
for at the legislature and today I get
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
to begin with probably the strangest
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
testimony that you will hear from me all
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
year because we do have a policy
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
position of course to support our
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
members but we also have a policy
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
position to clarify the law
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
I have handed out a letter to all of you
 
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
in the first section there I have
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
um copied down the existing law
 
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
underlining what I believe are the the
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
relevant Provisions that are causing
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
some confusion here
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and then in the second section uh I
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
have a couple of statutory
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation rules which are very
 
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.530 align:start position:0%
interpretation rules which are very
important

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
and knowing that your chair has written
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
more contractual language in his career
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
than I have probably read
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
um I know he knows how important it is
 
01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
to get things right and be clear
 
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
um so I'm sure he could talk to that in
 
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
executive session much more thoroughly
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
than I could hear but the courts
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
generally have two rules that are very
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
important for you to know as legislators
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
the first is that they don't look beyond
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
the language of the statute to figure
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
out what the intent is if they think
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
they understand what the statute says
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
and the second is that whenever possible
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
they give all words in the statute some
 
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.170 align:start position:0%
they give all words in the statute some
meaning

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:06.059 align:start position:0%
um and so in response to the town of
 
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
Enfield contacting representative
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
adjutant and us and letting us know
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
about this problem with the deputy town
 
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
clerk situation I went out I talked with
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
Municipal attorneys and as it turns out
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's some disagreement about what the
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
words in the existing statute mean
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
and the problem really comes in with RSA
 
01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.250 align:start position:0%
and the problem really comes in with RSA
669.65

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
669.65
 
01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:27.059 align:start position:0%
which has a provision that says unless
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
the deputy does not have his or her
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
domicile in town so presumably there
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
must be some situation where a deputy
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
could not be a resident of a town under
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
um and this was actually a problem
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature back in the
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
early 2000s so at that point in time
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
they made a determination that it would
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
be inappropriate for deputies to be res
 
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
not be residents of the town so deputies
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
should be residents so they modified the
 
01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
first two staff or the first statute
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
related to Deputy Town clerks which used
 
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
um what this bill proposes in its first
 
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:06.299 align:start position:0%
section and it says they have to be
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
qualified in the same manner except they
 
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
need not have their domicile in town
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
um but at the same time the legislature
 
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
recognized that there are there were at
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
um Deputy Town clerks who were in fact
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
not residents of the town and they
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to protect them in their
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
positions so they modified the vacancy
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
statute to include the language that I
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
cited earlier
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
um that has created some confusion
 
01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
because if you were like the Secretary
 
01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
of State you know what the legislative
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
history is you have that institutional
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
knowledge it obviously makes sense that
 
01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
you would want to do uh what the policy
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
of the legislature was
 
01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
um 20 years ago if you're uh 20 years
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
ago you were Middle School like me and
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
you became an attorney afterwards and
 
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
you read the statute and you said well I
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
think this is clear there must be some
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
circumstance your advice is going to be
 
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.630 align:start position:0%
circumstance your advice is going to be
well

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
obviously deputies don't have to be
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
residents of the town
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
so my testimony is strange today because
 
01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
well we support uh the changes that
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
would allow deputies not to be residents
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
to the town for all the reasons you've
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
already heard today
 
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
would support a a committee amendment
 
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
that modified the existing statute to
 
01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
clarify that they must be residents
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
because as it is right now the statutory
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
scheme is confusing and we need some
 
01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.090 align:start position:0%
scheme is confusing and we need some
clarity

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
um this comes into play a number of you
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
have asked questions today
 
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
um I think everyone in this room would
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
agree uh that town clerks and the
 
01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:39.980 align:start position:0%
functions they perform are essential
 
01:08:42.169 --> 01:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
realistically you can't have a town
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
running without someone performing those
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
functions whether or not they're a
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
resident so we really need to resolve
 
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
this issue in order to make towns
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
function well I know you wanted me to
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
keep my testimony short so I'll happily
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
answer any questions anyone has
 
01:09:02.169 --> 01:09:02.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so it's the strangest
 
01:09:08.289 --> 01:09:08.299 align:start position:0%
uh testimony yes
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
but uh my question to you is as you see
 
01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:13.849 align:start position:0%
but uh my question to you is as you see
it

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
in having the history
 
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
by clarifying that the deputy clerk can
 
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
only be an acting
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
in in case when the clerk is has to
 
01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:34.460 align:start position:0%
leave or has left or
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
vacated the position
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
would that help because it's only an
 
01:09:40.199 --> 01:09:41.630 align:start position:0%
would that help because it's only an
acting

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
acting
 
01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.249 align:start position:0%
acting
or

01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
would it can create more confusion thank
 
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
um just let me um Talk briefly about how
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the current Deputy process works so
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
what happens is the town clerk
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
basically nominates someone to be the
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
deputy and that person is appointed by
 
01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:02.780 align:start position:0%
the select board
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
that doesn't relate to whether they're
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
employed in the town clerk's office or
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
employed with the town that only relates
 
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
to what their statutory role is and
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that the
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
town clerk can do the deputy stands in
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
the place of the town clerk when the
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
town clerk goes to Disney World for two
 
01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:20.950 align:start position:0%
town clerk goes to Disney World for two
weeks

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
and that's really what we're trying to
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
um balance the policy on is well what if
 
01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
the town clerk leaves
 
01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
um you know before town meeting happens
 
01:10:32.219 --> 01:10:32.990 align:start position:0%
um you know before town meeting happens
um

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
you know how do we fill that position
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
until you know someone in town steps up
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and runs for that position obviously
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
it has to be a resident of the town that
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
becomes the town clerk
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and the second part of the bill
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
changes a show to a May
 
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and part of the reason behind that is
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
as I recall from my discussions with
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative adjective was you may be
 
01:10:58.729 --> 01:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
in a situation where you have a town
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
where a couple people step up and they
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
say I'd like to become Town Clerk and
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
the select board obviously if the select
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
board appoints one of them that's
 
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
basically saying this person we think is
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
best qualified voters you should vote
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
from it's it's basically an endorsement
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
the select board may not feel that's
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate but we still need someone to
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
do the town clerk function so it would
 
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.209 align:start position:0%
do the town clerk function so it would
be

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
um the I guess sort of the preference
 
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
there would be you know we'd certainly
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
like someone to be appointed if there's
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
only one person definitely do that
 
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
but if two people stand up they're
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
equally qualified they're both residents
 
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.689 align:start position:0%
equally qualified they're both residents
obviously

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
um but we can you know start the
 
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
training process get them familiar with
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
everything they would need to do as town
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
clerk but we don't want the select board
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
to interfere with that election by doing
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative uh yokelum thank you
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
um same question I had before do you
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
believe that this as as stated this
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
current language of the law would allow
 
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen to appoint
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
a a town clerk that is not a resident of
 
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
like knowing what I know now I will tell
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
you it's confusing when I read it the
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
first time I thought there must be a
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance where a deputy cannot be a
 
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
resident and therefore I mean otherwise
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
why would it say that in uh 669-65 in
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
which case
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
why would it need to be repeated
 
01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:33.380 align:start position:0%
um above in um
 
01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.090 align:start position:0%
um above in um
4118.

01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
4118.
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
so I now know the legislative history so
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I now know how it would be
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
interpreted by the Secretary of State I
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
know that background so my
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
interpretation would be different than
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
having read it the first time where I
 
01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
thought the legislature was clear in its
 
01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.209 align:start position:0%
thought the legislature was clear in its
intent

01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
I can I follow up
 
01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
a follow-up quickly yes thank you I
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
01:12:59.330 --> 01:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
um I must have stated the question
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
incorrectly if this law was to pass as
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
it was presented to us do you believe
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
that the selectman could then appoint a
 
01:13:08.699 --> 01:13:10.070 align:start position:0%
that the selectman could then appoint a
deputy

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
deputy
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
um clerk to fill the role of town clerk
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
given that there's a qualification in a
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
different section of law that requires
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
them to be domiciled yes because the
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
modification would mirror what the
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
statute said prior to 2002 or three and
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
it says they're qualified in the same
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
manner except they don't have to be
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions seeing
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
none oh uh representative Gilman
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was wondering if I
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
could recall uh this deputy secretary of
 
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
state because I thought of another
 
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
question that um I did not think of the
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
at the time if she's willing to do that
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
we'll do that after uh our next speaker
 
01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.410 align:start position:0%
we'll do that after uh our next speaker
sure

01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
um we next we have I believe it's Josie
 
01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.070 align:start position:0%
um we next we have I believe it's Josie

Hampshire and City Town clerks
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
Association representing clerks in The
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region
 
01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
I'm here today in opposition of this
 
01:14:57.050 --> 01:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
house bill 70.
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
but what I would like to do because my
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
colleague here is going to give you a
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
more official stance from the New
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and City Town clerks
 
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
Association is wrap some of my
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
viewpoints from my role on the
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
association in a conversation that I had
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
with my deputy
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
when I had learned of this change
 
01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
potential change to the role of Deputy
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
town clerk the first input input I
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
sought to seek from was my Deputy Clerk
 
01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
I value her input and her perspective on
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
this I also come from a position where I
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
started as deputy and was elected to the
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
reading the bill
 
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
through our discussion we came up with
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
intent and impact
 
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
but I want to start with impact
 
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
this bill would have negative
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
consequences to the office of the Town
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
Clerk and the constituents we represent
 
01:15:59.330 --> 01:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
how you may be wondering
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
this bill does not in fact make an
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
appointed Deputy town clerk who's
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
residing out of town does not give them
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to complete or fulfill the
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the town clerk's
 
01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.570 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the town clerk's
position

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
that is a stance that we believe we are
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
in agreement with the Secretary of
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
State's office on
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
and that is because the town clerk is a
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
resident of the community she or he
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
I want to provide some education on what
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
some of the responsibilities Town clerks
 
01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:40.910 align:start position:0%
some of the responsibilities Town clerks
have

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.169 align:start position:0%
have
are

01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
administer administering vital records
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
in their community
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
what does that mean well we complete
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
marriage licenses
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
we also complete paternities of
 
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:55.189 align:start position:0%
we also complete paternities of
affidavits

01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
affidavits
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
we do amendments on Vital Records
 
01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
that includes adoptions court ordered
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
court orders
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
and even clerical mistakes that were
 
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
made Down the Line This is confidential
 
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
information we would want the person
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
we've invested in our Deputy town clerk
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
who is a resident of the community to be
 
01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
the individual who if they see this
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
information they have that long-term
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
role within the community whereas an
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
appointed official who's not serving in
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
the community they may see this
 
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
information but they would not
 
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
ultimately be able to fill fulfill the
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
position of town clerk and would soon
 
01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.709 align:start position:0%
position of town clerk and would soon
leave

01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
leave
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
one selection came comes
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
we also do Motor Vehicle registrations
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
now in communities uh towns already have
 
01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
the option if they so choose to vote
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
they can separate motor vehicle
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
operations from the role of town clerk
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
and designate an appointed Municipal
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
agent to work on behalf of the state of
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
but we also do run elections with our
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
fellow election officials the moderator
 
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen and the supervisors of the
 
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
checklist this is an area that is
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
concerning that my deputy and I talked
 
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
about is that we firmly believe that the
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
deputy clerk should be a resident of the
 
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
community because that Deputy is
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
essential in fulfilling many of the
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we do on Election Day
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
I can give you some examples in the
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
office we work on we accept absentee
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
ballots and applications
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
we do voter registration
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
among other responsibilities we also
 
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
know our community members and do
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
recruitment for operations and on
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
Election Day
 
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
many towns have had it excuse me issues
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
filling the positions of ballot clerks
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
and so in Plymouth for example we have
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
two three stations for official check-in
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
if someone uses the restroom for example
 
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
I might ask my Deputy town clerk to sit
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
and assume their responsibilities until
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
that individual returns
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would essentially make it so
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
if an appointed Deputy town clerk is
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
residing out of town
 
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
were in this position they would not be
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
able to assist in that capacity
 
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
and that's just one of the examples I
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
now I want to talk about intent I don't
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
believe the intent of this bill was
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
malicious at all
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't informed the New Hampshire
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
City and town clerk's Association was
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
never reached out
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
um from the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
Association or representative Josh
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
adgerton what I would encourage is that
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
these individuals do work hand in hand
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
with the association
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
because there are some issues it is very
 
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
hard to fill a lot of elected capacities
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
even appointed
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
but this bill isn't solving the root
 
01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
problem here
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
there's two issues one is education and
 
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
that is something that the New Hampshire
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
and City Town clerks Association is
 
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
really going to be focusing on moving
 
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.470 align:start position:0%
really going to be focusing on moving
forward

01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
is making it our mission to make sure
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
that people know what town clerks do in
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
their offices and we need to work hand
 
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
in hand with our other officials in
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
towns to ensure that our communities
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
really know the responsibilities of the
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
and then additionally is some of these
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
positions in towns they're not offering
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
they're not competitive
 
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
unlike other positions like fire chief
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
police chief a lot of those positions
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
have changing have changing actors
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
people who go in stay for five seven
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
years you'll notice that a lot of town
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
clerks even their deputies are in those
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
positions for 10 20 30 years or more
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
they've been left behind while the rest
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
of the communities have progressed and
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
modernized in their Styles and
 
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.770 align:start position:0%
modernized in their Styles and
competitiveness

01:21:02.770 --> 01:21:02.780 align:start position:0%
competitiveness
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
many of these positions deputies may be
 
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
getting paid 13 14 an hour 15 might be
 
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
part-time no benefits
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
and then they're being asked to assume
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
that position to take on the role of
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
town clerk and many towns Town clerks
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
are not compensated well as what either
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
so there's a few root causes to this
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
issue I don't think it's an issue that's
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
affecting just Town clerks and their
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
deputies I think it extends and it's
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
broader than that
 
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.430 align:start position:0%
broader than that
um

01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
and there's ways that towns can manage
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
that moving forward I also just want to
 
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
Echo what deputy secretary of state
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
Aaron Hennessey had said is that
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to certain or particular
 
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
responsibilities such as elections and
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
Vital Records Town Clerk or their deputy
 
01:21:59.209 --> 01:21:59.219 align:start position:0%
should not be appointed uh
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
we do not want an undue influence over
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
the office
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the Town Clerk
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
and the state is vital
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
we are State agents just as much as we
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
are local agents
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
and we need to ensure that our practices
 
01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
are supported by state laws rather than
 
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
potentially being threatened that if an
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
appointed Deputy town clerk appointed by
 
01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
the board of Selectmen were not to
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
follow their wishes that the concern is
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
that they may be removed from office
 
01:22:38.689 --> 01:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
potentially and we don't want that we
 
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
want we want our deputies and we want
 
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
Town clerks to feel secure in the roles
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
that they can practice current state
 
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:47.229 align:start position:0%
that they can practice current state
laws

01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.050 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh Dan Healy okay uh first of all we
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a pink card on you you've got
 
01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.649 align:start position:0%
don't have a pink card on you you've got
it

01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
um is the testimony gonna be markedly
 
01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.750 align:start position:0%
um is the testimony gonna be markedly
different

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
um similar but short um if we yeah if we
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
could where the chairman has failed
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
miserably in his uh
 
01:23:13.209 --> 01:23:13.219 align:start position:0%
timing of this first uh first bill so
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move it along so if there's
 
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
anything repetitious kind of leave that
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
by the side if you have something that's
 
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
new uh we'll hear it so Dan hilley now
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
Short city clerk uh vice president of
 
01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire City and town clerks
 
01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:28.090 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire City and town clerks
Association

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:28.100 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
and our association is against this bill
 
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
um the main reason that we are against
 
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
this bill is a deputy town clerk cannot
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
work elections that's one of the main
 
01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
functions of the town clerk's job so if
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're a town clerk is ill or you know
 
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
not available for whatever reason on the
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
day of the election the deputy clerk
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
cannot fill in if they do not reside in
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
that community so that that's a major
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
concern uh for us
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
and I also don't believe that changing
 
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
the statue on the deputy clerk would
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
then allow them to ignore the
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
requirements for Town Clerk and step
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
into that position I think you'd still
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
need to meet the requirements of town
 
01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.390 align:start position:0%
need to meet the requirements of town
clerk

01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
even as acting town clerk you would need
 
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
to fulfill the requirements of of a town
 
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
clerk I don't think that this bill
 
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
addresses that that part it only changes
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
the deputy town clerk
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so if a town doesn't have a town
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
clerk if the town clerk retires the town
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
clerk leaves they need a town clerk or
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
an acting town clerk so a deputy uh
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
would not be able to access vital
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
records and they would not be able to
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
access the election system unless there
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
is a town clerk in the town and that
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
situation happened to me when I left
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
Derry the state would not leave on vital
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
records in the election system without
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
an acting town clerk in place so I don't
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
think that a deputy that doesn't live in
 
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
town would meet the requirements to be a
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
town clerk and you would have no access
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
to vital records and you wouldn't be
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:17.570 align:start position:0%
able to
um

01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
assist during elections and it's also
 
01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
only a temporary fix so if you're saying
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
at the next town meeting then the A-Town
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
clerk would need to be elected that
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
lives in that town you could only be
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
talking a few months so the town's going
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
to be in the situation where they need
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
to fill that that role
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
either at that point or maybe just a few
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
months down the line
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you for your
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
testimony uh representative
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
um I think it's directed at both of you
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
and also at the deputy secretary of
 
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:01.340 align:start position:0%
state so the assistant clerk workaround
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
would not be usable if the clerk were
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
absent during an election
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
it would it would not be I I don't
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
believe unless all the assistants lived
 
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
in town I mean if anyone that lives in
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
follow a coach and go ahead thank you
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
um and and so it's not really a
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
workaround is it it's it's not really a
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
workaround if you have the deputy
 
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
residing out of town you would still
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
need some someone who needs to be
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
appointed to
 
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie thank you Mr
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank you for your
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
testimony particularly uh indicating how
 
01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
important this Deputy is uh to the town
 
01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
uh do you see this bill requiring any
 
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
Community to appoint a deputy that is
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
out of town
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
isn't it isn't it more of an option
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
so I believe the way the law is right
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
now is that towns don't need to have a
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
deputy so they wouldn't I don't see this
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
as uh them needing to appoint a deputy
 
01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:27.229 align:start position:0%
as uh them needing to appoint a deputy
right

01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
a majority of responsible Town clerks do
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
have deputies they've appointed to
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
assume responsibility as if they are
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
unable to what this may do is further
 
01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:41.060 align:start position:0%
confusion actually because
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
towns may think that by appointing a
 
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
deputy from out of town they may be
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
setting up that person for failure down
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
the line I think it we can all relate to
 
01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
starting a position wanting to move up
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
and be able to grow
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
in that capacity really it's setting
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
that individual up for failure or
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
stagnancy where they wouldn't be able to
 
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
move up at all because of the election
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
the elected piece so towns May appoint
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
someone from out of town but the
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
emptiness of this bill is that that
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
individual can't fulfill the clerk's
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and neither can they
 
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
become elected if that position becomes
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
vacant and there's other things to
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
consider in this but it you know to in
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
respect to your question I won't go into
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
those but I hope that is a further
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
explanation thank you for your testimony
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:44.209 --> 01:28:44.219 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gilman
 
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this mate excuse me
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
this may be able to answer the question
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
that I was going to ask the deputy
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.270 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
um

01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the definition of
 
01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
certified documents uh Throughout the
 
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
documents that need to be certified by
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
the town clerk so certified documents
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
would probably relate to the vital
 
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:17.219 align:start position:0%
records that we issue so as Town Clerk
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
or or Deputy town clerk were able to
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
sign at the bottom of the vital record
 
01:29:24.169 --> 01:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
and then we put the town or city seal
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
over our signature and then it's a it's
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
a certified vital record
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair follow up
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I've as sitting on the select board
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
I've had documents that uh pertain to
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
federal grants that need to be certified
 
01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
when we either accept the funds or make
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
the application and the line is here
 
01:29:48.729 --> 01:29:48.739 align:start position:0%
appeared before me
 
01:29:48.739 --> 01:29:50.450 align:start position:0%
appeared before me
so

01:29:50.450 --> 01:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
how does this work around stamping
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
something and then having the person the
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
town clerk sign it later fulfill that
 
01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
Federal requirement
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
so I believe the reference earlier was
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
on the vital records so any documents uh
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
like that grants and things as city
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
clerk town clerk we sign those directly
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
on the vital records it's an ink
 
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.050 align:start position:0%
on the vital records it's an ink
signature

01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
signature
 
01:30:18.169 --> 01:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
um because we larger communities we do
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
probably 50 to 100 certificates a day so
 
01:30:25.090 --> 01:30:25.100 align:start position:0%
if the clerk's not there this gives
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
customers the opportunity to still
 
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
retrieve their records it still is an
 
01:30:31.729 --> 01:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
ink stamp and it still is certified but
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
different depending on the documents
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
um like grants and things I would sign
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
directly but the stamp signature is a
 
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
valid signature that can be used for
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
those other documents on the the
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
day-to-day functions where the clerk
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
might be gone for a few hours or you
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
know on lunch it's not holding up
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
residents from retrieving records thank
 
01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.790 align:start position:0%
residents from retrieving records thank

01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%

okay thank you for your testimony uh we
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
do not have any more pink cards
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
I don't see anybody waving in the
 
01:31:04.679 --> 01:31:06.350 align:start position:0%
I don't see anybody waving in the
audience

01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
audience
 
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.030 align:start position:0%
audience
so

01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman would you allow
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
the deputy secretary Hennessey to be
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
recalled I have a quick question
 
01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:19.970 align:start position:0%
recalled I have a quick question
sure

01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
as long as it's a nice quick question
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
because we are way behind
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
foreign welcome back thank you Mr
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
um very briefly during this hearing I've
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
heard testimony referring to the deputy
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
clerk acting as the town clerk
 
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
could you please
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
um clarify that because according to
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
statutory language under 669 colon 65
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
pertaining to vacancies of the town
 
01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
clerk is my understanding that the
 
01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:00.110 align:start position:0%
clerk is my understanding that the
vacancy

01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
vacancy
 
01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
would be filled by appointment and
 
01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.370 align:start position:0%
would be filled by appointment and
therefore

01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
the deputy town clerk would in fact not
 
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
be acting
 
01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
as the town clerk that Deputy Town town
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
clerk would then become the town clerk
 
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
could you clarify that
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:24.020 align:start position:0%
representative uh my reading of um
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
669.65 is the same as yours in that uh
 
01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:29.060 align:start position:0%
the deputy
 
01:32:31.729 --> 01:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
would assume the responsibilities of the
 
01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
clerk and my apologies
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
um the word workaround was referenced
 
01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
before associated with the Secretary of
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
State's office
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I I didn't mean to infer that an
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
assistant in the town clerk's office is
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
a workaround to be in a town clerk
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
that that's not what um I had testified
 
01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:55.910 align:start position:0%
that that's not what um I had testified
to

01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:32:59.689 --> 01:32:59.699 align:start position:0%
see no more pink cards I'm going to
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:06.169 align:start position:0%

I as I said before I have failed
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
miserably in my very first act as
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%

01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%

um I am also the chair of the
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
Chesterfield Public Library Board of
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
Trustees I have submitted this bill it's
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
very simple it just changes the word and
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
to the word or
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
um RSA 202a15 would read The Librarians
 
01:34:38.209 --> 01:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
shall have education of sufficient
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
breadth and depth to give leadership to
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
the use of books and related materials
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
the librarian shall be appointed by the
 
01:34:47.209 --> 01:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
board of Library Trustees for a term of
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
office agreed to at the time of
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
employment and until a successor is
 
01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
appointed and qualified I am asking to
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
change that to or until a successor is
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
qualified is appointed and qualified
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
I'm doing that on behalf of my library
 
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees
 
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
because I live in a very very small
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
community Spofford is Tiny and it is
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible for us to comply
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
with the present RSA
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
if we lose a director for any reason
 
01:35:22.330 --> 01:35:22.340 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it's hard to find a director
 
01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
to take over and virtually impossible to
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
find an interim
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
we've lost in the past five years we've
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
lost directors because of a severe
 
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency we lost one after covid
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
who decided she really did prefer to be
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
a stay-at-home mom and we lost one
 
01:35:45.169 --> 01:35:45.179 align:start position:0%
because the trustees decided not to
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
renew a contract
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
in none of these instances would it have
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
been feasible for the director to remain
 
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
in the position
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
until a new director was found as a
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
replacement as it says in the current
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
law and until a replacement is can be
 
01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.330 align:start position:0%
law and until a replacement is can be
found

01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
found
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's no possible way I can say to a
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
director who wants to be a stay-at-home
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
mom no you can't do that you have to
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
stay here until we find a replacement
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
she's not an indentured servant
 
01:36:20.209 --> 01:36:20.219 align:start position:0%
nor in our small community could we
 
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
always find an interim in in one
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
instance we were able to do so in a
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
second instance we offered the position
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
to a possible interim and the salary
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
that she demanded was so high that we
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
just couldn't afford to pay that
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
our other staff employees as many
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
organizations are trying to do we're
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
trying to hire Young new people give
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
them a chance and so our other staff
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
employees our first year employees and
 
01:36:52.129 --> 01:36:52.139 align:start position:0%
they really do not possess at this point
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
in their careers an education of
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient and of breadth and depth to
 
01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
serve as a director even as an interim
 
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
um we were able to find a new director
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
very quickly this last time in less than
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
two months and the Board of Trustees is
 
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
very happy with our choice
 
01:37:19.209 --> 01:37:19.219 align:start position:0%
in the meantime we have a um
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
bylaw and a Personnel policy says that
 
01:37:25.729 --> 01:37:25.739 align:start position:0%
says the day day to day liaison between
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
the monthly board meetings can be the
 
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
chair of the Board of Trustees
 
01:37:34.129 --> 01:37:34.139 align:start position:0%
um but we have always given our
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
directors contracts we've always decided
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
at the time of employment what their
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
term of office is going to be we just
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
can't always comply with
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
um if they choose to leave and until a
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
successor can be found so I'm asking you
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
to please give small towns like myself
 
01:37:58.250 --> 01:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
the flexibility of or until a successor
 
01:37:59.410 --> 01:37:59.420 align:start position:0%
is found
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that we can comply with rsas that's
 
01:38:06.250 --> 01:38:06.260 align:start position:0%
certainly our intent all along
 
01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
and if you have any questions I'll be
 
01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony uh
 
01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative man triputi
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my quick question to
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
you is the role of a librarian public
 
01:38:23.159 --> 01:38:24.790 align:start position:0%
you is the role of a librarian public
librarian

01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
librarian
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
has it changed significantly not just
 
01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
working with books and you know
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
libraries public libraries have become a
 
01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:36.179 align:start position:0%
community center per se
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
so has that anything to do with being
 
01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
able to hire replace
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
um you are thank you for the question
 
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
and you are absolutely correct the role
 
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
of libraries has has changed
 
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
significantly rightly so
 
01:38:59.229 --> 01:38:59.239 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
our library I can't speak for others in
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
the state but our libraries have always
 
01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
our library has always tried to find
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
someone who has an a current MLS degree
 
01:39:15.530 --> 01:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
someone that is up to date with the
 
01:39:18.649 --> 01:39:18.659 align:start position:0%
practices and the protocols of operating
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
a library
 
01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:21.229 align:start position:0%
a library
um

01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
perhaps that may and maybe that's one of
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
the reasons why it is difficult for our
 
01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
library and others too to find that
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
person that has sufficient breadth and
 
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
knowledge to be a librarian I would not
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
recommend lowering your library
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
standards and and hiring somebody that
 
01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
wasn't as qualified as your community
 
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative Powell thank you Mr
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:39:59.209 --> 01:39:59.219 align:start position:0%
question so I'm looking at the the um
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
change to that the bill is proposing to
 
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
the current language
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the fact that
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
you have or I understand the change from
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
the and to the or
 
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that this will
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
enable an interim librarian to be hired
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
my concerns the question that I have is
 
01:40:30.169 --> 01:40:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
does this language change still require
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
that the librarian Remain the current
 
01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
librarian remain as an employee
 
01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
until the success is appointed despite
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
the contract
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to change I'm
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
trying to change that the librarian
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
would not have to stay in the current
 
01:40:52.739 --> 01:40:53.649 align:start position:0%
would not have to stay in the current
position

01:40:53.649 --> 01:40:53.659 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
the director that left due to a severe
 
01:40:58.610 --> 01:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency could not possibly stay
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
in his current position so I'm asking
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
that it'd be changed so that the person
 
01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
does not have to or cannot stay in that
 
01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:10.669 align:start position:0%
does not have to or cannot stay in that
position

01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
um is is allowed to to leave and we are
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
still compliant with the law now if if
 
01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
um would prefer it does I agree with you
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
that that and and or
 
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh Clause at the end gets a little murky
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
I definitely agree so if the committee
 
01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
would prefer and you would feel it would
 
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
be cleaner to accomplish what I'm trying
 
01:41:38.689 --> 01:41:38.699 align:start position:0%
to accomplish here we could simply
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
just stop we could say that last
 
01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
sentence I won't read the first sentence
 
01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
but the last sentence could be the
 
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
librarian shall be appointed by the
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
board of Library Trustees for a term of
 
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
office agreed to at the time of
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
employment period
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to introduce that
 
01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.810 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to introduce that
Amendment

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question
 
01:42:00.770 --> 01:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
um that's exactly what I have noted on
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
my um bill here okay so
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
um yes I I we please look into doing
 
01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
that right I I would be happy to do that
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
I can go to up up to OLS this afternoon
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
and take care of that and bring you in
 
01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative still have a question
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative power asked my question
 
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
oh foreign
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
we're all thinking alike representative
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
um this is much like the previous bill
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
in that we're talking about in order of
 
01:42:34.679 --> 01:42:35.990 align:start position:0%
in that we're talking about in order of
succession

01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
succession
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering would it be
 
01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:42.980 align:start position:0%
it'll be harder than changing and tour
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
but would it be better to have uh this
 
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
paragraph include
 
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
some language about
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
an interim librarian that could be
 
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
someone on the staff I think that thank
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
you for the question I think that would
 
01:43:01.209 --> 01:43:01.219 align:start position:0%
be making things much more complicated
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
some libraries don't have an assistant
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
director or or an interim director or
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
anything like that so that would might
 
01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:12.229 align:start position:0%
anything like that so that would might
be

01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:14.699 align:start position:0%
um causing them then to hire someone
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
that could automatically move into that
 
01:43:21.169 --> 01:43:21.179 align:start position:0%
position also the job descriptions and
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
the um are different for a director and
 
01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:29.219 align:start position:0%
an interim or an assistant as well as
 
01:43:31.970 --> 01:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
the qualifications our assistant
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
director does not need to have an MLs
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
degree so it might not be the best
 
01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.250 align:start position:0%
degree so it might not be the best
um

01:43:40.250 --> 01:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
a thing for her or the library for her
 
01:43:46.129 --> 01:43:46.139 align:start position:0%
to automatically move into the the uh
 
01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:48.659 align:start position:0%
directorship thank you
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
I think I think what we're talking about
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
just ending it after
 
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
um agreed to at the time of employment
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
period is probably a cleaner way to
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
handle it than trying to bring in
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
assistant directors and interims and all
 
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
of that just my opinion
 
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
I'm over here behind the thing yeah I
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
would like that moved like to be in
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
front of you but um the uh you keep on
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
mentioning the word director
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
um but we're talking about Librarians
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just wondering about
 
01:44:25.679 --> 01:44:26.290 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just wondering about
um

01:44:26.290 --> 01:44:26.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
if this is really an issue of
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
directorship or if this is a issue of
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
you have to have a librarian you can
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
only have one and therefore this person
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
is you know leaving the job and
 
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:42.179 align:start position:0%
therefore you can't you're you're not
 
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
able to hire another librarian so I
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
don't understand where the issue kind of
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
is lying can you clarify that I can
 
01:44:53.209 --> 01:44:53.219 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question so
 
01:44:53.219 --> 01:44:54.649 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question so
this

01:44:54.649 --> 01:44:54.659 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
um when it's talking about the librarian
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
in the statute it is talking about the
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
librarian director
 
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
okay the libraries have Library
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
directors they have assistant directors
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
they have youth Librarians and then they
 
01:45:10.330 --> 01:45:10.340 align:start position:0%
have just Librarians that handle the
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
circulation desk this statute is talking
 
01:45:13.679 --> 01:45:15.109 align:start position:0%

um the direct the library director
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%

person that the Board of Trustees has
 
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
the authority to hire all other

move past this one for right now and uh
 
01:47:57.290 --> 01:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
I'll actually make a decision on that
 
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%

the ministry
 
01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
administrator do you mind I can't hear
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.590 --> 01:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
would you no I can't do that the bill
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
has not been introduced um this the
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is not here and quite
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
honestly I I kind of of the
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
thinking that if the prime sponsor can't
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
show up for her bill I
 
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
know oh he is
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm gonna say nobody's notified us
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
on that but uh okay
 
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair yes uh representative may I
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
respectfully interrupt and just note
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
that in the past if the prime sponsor
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
was not available for whatever reason
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
um one of us any one of us on the
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee would be happy to present the
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill in that person's stead as a
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
courtesy to the other representative
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
thanks yes I I am aware of that that has
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
been the practice on uh several of the
 
01:49:08.810 --> 01:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
Committees I've been to also I kind of
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
prefer to have the prime sponsor here
 
01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:13.010 align:start position:0%
prefer to have the prime sponsor here
um

01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:13.020 align:start position:0%

01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%

01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'd like to call up uh Derek

okay uh we'd like to call up uh Derek
ferland

01:50:47.689 --> 01:50:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.570 --> 01:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
probably hear me now okay thank you my
 
01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
name is Derek Ferlin I'm the County
 
01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
Manager for Sullivan County uh
 
01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of this bill uh
 
01:50:58.370 --> 01:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly someone from the bullpen um
 
01:51:01.129 --> 01:51:01.139 align:start position:0%
because uh this bill although I was not
 
01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
aware it was submitted until I Was
 
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
preparing for the other bills that I'll
 
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
be testifying later today uh certainly
 
01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
in favor of it because in theory it's uh
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
simply updating a threshold that appears
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
to last have been updated either in 1998
 
01:51:16.129 --> 01:51:16.139 align:start position:0%
or 1979 so I think it's just a simple
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
matter of keeping up with the times and
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
adjusting for inflation and I think
 
01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
going from five thousand to ten thousand
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
is not an unreasonable increase to the
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
limit in fact it's in line with
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
thresholds currently in practice at
 
01:51:31.850 --> 01:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
governor and Council for contracts that
 
01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:34.139 align:start position:0%
they approve so I think it's a common
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
sense adjustment given the times and
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
um won't this
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
set a cascading effect for other
 
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
counties that
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
currently have this threshold and if one
 
01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
County changes it won't that have a
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the changes to RSA
 
01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:15.980 align:start position:0%
28 8 and so it repeals
 
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
288-ft which is the specific Rockingham
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
County so yes 288 does apply to all 10
 
01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:27.169 align:start position:0%
County so yes 288 does apply to all 10
counties

01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman isn't there a
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
conflict in that actually in addition to
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount that section one
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the uh Amendment are the article says
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
the provisions in this sections shall
 
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:50.219 align:start position:0%
apply to all counties of the state and
 
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
yet we still have Hillsborough County
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
that has a a different uh procedure how
 
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
do we uh keep uh say that this is a this
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
applies to all counties in the state and
 
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
I am probably not in a great position to
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
speak to that since I'm from Sullivan
 
01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
County but it does appear as though
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
there is an allowance to change 28 8-e
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
which is the Hillsborough County
 
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
specific statute so I would say as long
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
as there's Clarity and consistency then
 
01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
that would be a good thing and however
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's achieved would be would make
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
sense to me follow up Mr chairman if I
 
01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
you know you know in thank you Mr
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
chairman uh do you know whether or not
 
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:46.139 align:start position:0%
the petitioner representative Edwards
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be agreeable to deleting Section 3
 
01:53:53.689 --> 01:53:53.699 align:start position:0%
in this bill the competitive bid in in
 
01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
do you know if he's being I I do not I
 
01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
do not all right thank you thank you Mr
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question this committee has
 
01:54:08.159 --> 01:54:09.770 align:start position:0%
taking my question this committee has
customarily

01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
customarily
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
um been hesitant to make changes in the
 
01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
rsas that apply to all counties in the
 
01:54:17.590 --> 01:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
state for obvious reasons
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
and so my problem has to do with uh
 
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
lines four through five
 
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh if if you have
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
bylaws in
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County that allow you to make
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
these changes you could easily make
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
these changes without
 
01:54:37.609 --> 01:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
forcing all of the counties in the state
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
to do what you're doing
 
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I I guess my question is would you be
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
amenable to amending the bill to remove
 
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
the reference to all counties in the
 
01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.430 align:start position:0%
the reference to all counties in the
state

01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
oh thanks for the question again I think
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's probably best answered by the
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor I just I'd be way in over my
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
head if I were to try to speak on on his
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
behalf I will say though that we have a
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
a purchasing and procurement policy that
 
01:55:09.169 --> 01:55:09.179 align:start position:0%
does go beyond the RSA again just
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
speaking for Sullivan County only and
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
even with the five thousand dollar
 
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
threshold as currently written we
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
actually have subordinate procedures
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
where we require at least three quotes
 
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
for purchases above three thousand
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and Below five thousand and So
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
Below three thousand is where we can
 
01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
just do sole source purchasing and I
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
would expect that we would amend our
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
purchasing and procurement policy
 
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
accordingly if this threshold is raised
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
so this just simply sets the upper limit
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
where it says you have to go out to bid
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh just with the cost of materials
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
and other Commodities that we commonly
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
have to purchase today it just is a
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
um an added layer that I think given the
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
you know when this was originally
 
01:55:51.250 --> 01:55:51.260 align:start position:0%
adopted again whether it was 98 or 1979
 
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
I think it's appropriate to evaluate
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um I'm just
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
going to say that uh the the lack of the
 
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
ability to actually question the the
 
01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
maker of the bill is the reason why I
 
01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:09.659 align:start position:0%
hesitated to even bring it up because I
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
have numerous questions for uh
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards that we cannot
 
01:56:16.729 --> 01:56:16.739 align:start position:0%
get answers to right now so uh for the
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
time being I'm going to close the
 
01:56:32.890 --> 01:56:32.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay we will open the hearing on House
 
01:56:41.689 --> 01:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
Bill 36 relative to fees of sheriffs and
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
Deputy sheriffs and I believe
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative fellows will be speaking
 
01:56:52.729 --> 01:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
I can still say good morning uh chairman
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
turcotte and committee members I'm Sally
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
fellows I represent Plymouth Ashland and
 
01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.330 align:start position:0%
fellows I represent Plymouth Ashland and
holderness

01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
holderness
 
01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:06.890 align:start position:0%
holderness
and

01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
I I see this as pretty much a
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill
 
01:57:15.169 --> 01:57:15.179 align:start position:0%
there the a law was passed
 
01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
two years ago to allow the fees related
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
to Sheriff's Services
 
01:57:23.639 --> 01:57:25.570 align:start position:0%
to Sheriff's Services
um

01:57:25.570 --> 01:57:25.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
instead of being as instead of being a
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
fixed amount written into statute which
 
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
it was two years ago now it it can be
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
um the the sheriffs can make an
 
01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
adjustment to those fees based on
 
01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:44.330 align:start position:0%
adjustment to those fees based on
inflation

01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
01:57:48.530 --> 01:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
and it it came to my attention when I
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
worked with the county delegation last
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
year that people
 
01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
saw different ways to interpret the way
 
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
that measure of inflation was defined in
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
statute so what I did is I got together
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
with the sheriffs and we're all on the
 
01:58:14.689 --> 01:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
same page that we can use this new
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
language to Define inflation
 
01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
so it's the inflation rate is will be
 
01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
and and the change in the annual
 
01:58:28.270 --> 01:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
inflation rate from one year to the next
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
and this has doesn't change the part of
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
the statute that makes it optional it
 
01:58:38.089 --> 01:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
just says it changes the way inflation
 
01:58:42.770 --> 01:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony are there
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:58:50.810 --> 01:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
my question is um with regards to
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
the reference to the CPI for all Urban
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
consumers specifically the Northeast
 
01:59:07.609 --> 01:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
region and I did go to the website and
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
and looked at the different charts and
 
01:59:12.649 --> 01:59:12.659 align:start position:0%
information there my question is
 
01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
is it why is the Northeast region
 
01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
selected and is there um
 
01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
a metric specific or an average
 
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
specifically for the State of New
 
01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:26.270 align:start position:0%
specifically for the State of New
Hampshire

01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:59:44.209 --> 01:59:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.810 --> 01:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
so so this build does not change
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
um that part that you just asked about
 
01:59:52.129 --> 01:59:52.139 align:start position:0%
the that it references the Northeast
 
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
consumer price index that was there
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
before but to answer your question there
 
01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
is not one for specifically for New
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are many different
 
02:00:07.629 --> 02:00:07.639 align:start position:0%
um areas there are also different cpis
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of them for example
 
02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:12.189 align:start position:0%
some of them for example
um

02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
education funding in the adequacy aid
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
formula uses change to this annual
 
02:00:21.169 --> 02:00:21.179 align:start position:0%
change to the CPI
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
for all Urban excluding medical expenses
 
02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:27.179 align:start position:0%
so there are many different cpis
 
02:00:27.179 --> 02:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
so there are many different cpis
and

02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this bill does
 
02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
well is clarify
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what is meant by changing the
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
CPI so it's specifically with the
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
amendment it's specifically refers to
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
the annual and you can see on this chart
 
02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
this is just I put a note at the bottom
 
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
but this chart is exactly what you get
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
when you go to the Internet and look it
 
02:01:01.250 --> 02:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
up if you're actually getting the CPI
 
02:01:02.770 --> 02:01:02.780 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
references that's referenced in statute
 
02:01:09.649 --> 02:01:09.659 align:start position:0%
and some people one of the common
 
02:01:09.659 --> 02:01:11.149 align:start position:0%
and some people one of the common
confusions

02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
confusions
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
is the difference between the annual CPI
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
change and a 12-month CPI change
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
annual is based on what the CPI was for
 
02:01:26.450 --> 02:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
all 12 months of the year
 
02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you hear on the news
 
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
they'll refer to a 12-month change in
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
the CPI and that is just looking at two
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
data points it for example it would look
 
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
at the CPI number in
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh July of one year in July of the next
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
and using the annual is better
 
02:01:53.089 --> 02:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
because things can be volatile for one
 
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
from one month to the next as you saw
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
during the last year the price of gas
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know went up and then it came down
 
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
again so that's one of the components of
 
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
the CPI so it's better to use annual it
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
Smooths it out so you don't get peaks in
 
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
if you know it's actually technically
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
possible that you could actually have a
 
02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:20.209 align:start position:0%
possible that you could actually have a
negative

02:02:20.209 --> 02:02:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
do you know the last time that these
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
fees that we're talking about were
 
02:02:39.599 --> 02:02:42.530 align:start position:0%
fees that we're talking about were
raised

02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
um this this bill has been in effect the
 
02:02:48.649 --> 02:02:48.659 align:start position:0%
bill that passed two years ago
 
02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
only only came to be used just this past
 
02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:53.990 align:start position:0%
only only came to be used just this past
year

02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:02:56.089 --> 02:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
on the count in it so it would be the
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
county budget and the sheriff's fees
 
02:03:03.649 --> 02:03:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:07.129 --> 02:03:07.139 align:start position:0%
and um maybe somebody else who I don't I
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how long it had been before
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
that so maybe somebody else might be
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
able to tell you
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
in a single sentence could you
 
02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:35.810 align:start position:0%
in a single sentence could you
state

02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:03:38.689 --> 02:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
why this change is needed
 
02:03:41.089 --> 02:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
because it was in different people
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
interpreted it differently
 
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.290 align:start position:0%
interpreted it differently
and

02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't always interpreted as even
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
an a 12-month change it wasn't
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
interpreted as sometimes not as even as
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
a 12-month change so that's one of the
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I took out that reference to
 
02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:04.490 align:start position:0%
reasons I took out that reference to
June

02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
um because that was part of the
 
02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
confusion and I just changed it to
 
02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:09.589 align:start position:0%
confusion and I just changed it to
annual

02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
annual
 
02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
for the year calendar year so there
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
would be no confusion and using
 
02:04:19.729 --> 02:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
um the the timing works fine
 
02:04:21.649 --> 02:04:21.659 align:start position:0%
in terms of using
 
02:04:21.659 --> 02:04:22.550 align:start position:0%
in terms of using
um

02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:04:31.070 --> 02:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so this clarifies
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
because the budget cycle is June I can't
 
02:04:44.209 --> 02:04:44.219 align:start position:0%
I said this clarifies because the county
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
budget runs from June end of June to you
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
know beginning of uh my my understanding
 
02:04:54.770 --> 02:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
is that the counties are not the same
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
some run on a calendar year some run on
 
02:05:00.109 --> 02:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
a um
 
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know July to June so using this
 
02:05:07.490 --> 02:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
annual one I think will work pretty well
 
02:05:10.010 --> 02:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
because from what I could see when I
 
02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
looked on the internet the ones who use
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
a calendar year actually don't seem to
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
be voting on their budget until March
 
02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.179 align:start position:0%
kind of like towns some towns do so I
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
think the timing will work
 
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:26.930 align:start position:0%
think the timing will work
well

02:05:26.930 --> 02:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:05:35.649 --> 02:05:35.659 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:05:35.659 --> 02:05:38.169 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
okay

02:05:38.169 --> 02:05:38.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:54.410 --> 02:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
good morning or I guess it's good
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon now
 
02:06:02.109 --> 02:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Diane schuett
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
I represent Merrimack 12 the town of
 
02:06:10.070 --> 02:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
Pembroke and I am co-sponsored this bill
 
02:06:13.010 --> 02:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm appearing before you today as
 
02:06:15.790 --> 02:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
chair of the Merrimack County delegation
 
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
and would just appeal to you all as
 
02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
members of your respective County
 
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
delegations that this small correction
 
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
is important for the budget work in each
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
of your respective counties
 
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh there are a few sheriffs of hearing
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
before you also who can describe the
 
02:06:39.169 --> 02:06:39.179 align:start position:0%
effects of this a little change on their
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
specific departments and I hope that you
 
02:06:46.609 --> 02:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
will all support passage of this uh I
 
02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
would say to representative lascelles
 
02:06:52.089 --> 02:06:52.099 align:start position:0%
that the last
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
increase was 2010.
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.679 --> 02:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.129 --> 02:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
that that does complete your testimony
 
02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:15.659 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
the nature of the my question with
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
respect to the last time those fees were
 
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.310 align:start position:0%
respect to the last time those fees were
set

02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
set
 
02:07:27.550 --> 02:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
applying a an inflation Factor
 
02:07:37.129 --> 02:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
to the base which was set in 2010
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
will it not have the effect of
 
02:07:44.209 --> 02:07:44.219 align:start position:0%
perpetuating a lower fee
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
because even though now we would have an
 
02:07:50.990 --> 02:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
inflation factor that keeps up with
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
current inflation
 
02:07:55.689 --> 02:07:55.699 align:start position:0%
the difference between
 
02:08:00.129 --> 02:08:00.139 align:start position:0%
2010 and today's prices
 
02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
will not be affected because we're
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
basing it on 2010.
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
um not exactly and I I will admit that
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative fellows is the math
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
person who uh perfected this idea and
 
02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
again I think the sheriffs behind me who
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
each represent a different County can
 
02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
tell you the effect that it will have on
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
their specific budgets
 
02:08:32.689 --> 02:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:35.330 --> 02:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
represent uh yokella
 
02:08:37.189 --> 02:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
question hi
 
02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:40.609 align:start position:0%
question hi
um

02:08:40.609 --> 02:08:40.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
as the
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
um chair of your delegation when is the
 
02:08:49.250 --> 02:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
first time that you're seeing the
 
02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
um that you would be proposed a number
 
02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:54.770 align:start position:0%
um that you would be proposed a number
um

02:08:54.770 --> 02:08:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:59.089 --> 02:08:59.099 align:start position:0%
um and is your delegation on the um
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal or the the calendar year
 
02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:09.179 align:start position:0%

written testimony uh lead off but I have
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
might have a little bit more historical
 
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge to uh to this matter as we go
 
02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:16.669 align:start position:0%
knowledge to uh to this matter as we go
forward

02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.010 --> 02:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
back uh this past summer uh
 
02:11:21.229 --> 02:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative fellows had approached
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's Association to discuss the
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
matter with
 
02:11:28.250 --> 02:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
um what we're here to discuss today uh
 
02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
with the CPI and uh the sheriffs had
 
02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
discussed how we uh bill out how the law
 
02:11:36.649 --> 02:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
read and we were in agreement that uh
 
02:11:38.450 --> 02:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
there should be some adjustments as a
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
house cleaning uh process
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
um 2010 was the last time that the fees
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
were increased that we're aware of in
 
02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
last year we had attempted to fix some
 
02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
of that but of course when we uh that
 
02:11:54.970 --> 02:11:54.980 align:start position:0%
was through Senate Bill 77
 
02:11:58.490 --> 02:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
we found that there was a house cleaning
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh section that needed to be fixed and
 
02:12:04.129 --> 02:12:04.139 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here today
 
02:12:04.139 --> 02:12:04.970 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here today
um

02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:06.649 --> 02:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
we do not
 
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I I'm a believer that with the
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
services that we provide when it comes
 
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
to uh civil process uh we're not
 
02:12:15.530 --> 02:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
collecting uh exactly what is
 
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily being spent out
 
02:12:20.209 --> 02:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
um to do the services so this will just
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
help uh offset uh the costs that are
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
associated with doing the job as we know
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
gas prices went up uh you know printing
 
02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
paper Printing on paper went up paper
 
02:12:32.209 --> 02:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
went up
 
02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
um all that stuff so we're just trying
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
to capture a little more revenue on that
 
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
end in order for us to
 
02:12:40.729 --> 02:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
um provide a better service for our
 
02:12:40.739 --> 02:12:44.870 align:start position:0%
um provide a better service for our
community

02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:48.649 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

02:12:48.649 --> 02:12:48.659 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
seeing that and I actually have a couple
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
for you guys
 
02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:53.390 align:start position:0%
for you guys
um

02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
I'm noting in the language that uh
 
02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative schuett mentioned that
 
02:12:59.569 --> 02:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
the last increase was in 2020 or
 
02:12:59.579 --> 02:13:00.550 align:start position:0%
the last increase was in 2020 or
something

02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
am I understanding the language
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
correctly it says that uh it the fees
 
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
may be increased annually
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
and it has to be approved by the vote of
 
02:13:18.669 --> 02:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
the County Convention so
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
even if and I'm not saying that this is
 
02:13:23.149 --> 02:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
what we should do I'm just saying that
 
02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
even if this is approved it still puts
 
02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
the ultimate Authority for raising fees
 
02:13:31.129 --> 02:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the County Convention
 
02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
because the word is May
 
02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:35.930 align:start position:0%
because the word is May
and

02:13:35.930 --> 02:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:37.729 --> 02:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
says by a vote of the County Convention
 
02:13:41.450 --> 02:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm understanding that correctly
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
you are sir every uh County Sheriff
 
02:13:47.089 --> 02:13:47.099 align:start position:0%
would work with their commission and
 
02:13:49.490 --> 02:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
County Administrator to prepare
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
correspondence for the delegation this
 
02:13:54.169 --> 02:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
is what I did last year and I want to
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
put for the record I'm very thankful
 
02:13:58.609 --> 02:13:58.619 align:start position:0%
that representative fellows caught this
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
given her background in this area of
 
02:14:04.609 --> 02:14:04.619 align:start position:0%
finance and pointed this out and kind of
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
came to us to uh
 
02:14:09.229 --> 02:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
because this piece was not known to us
 
02:14:10.490 --> 02:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
in the Bill about the one percent
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
increase for the month of June we just
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
saw that in the end that this is great
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
they're raising the fees we didn't want
 
02:14:18.290 --> 02:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
to go too far we didn't want to go too
 
02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
little and all of a sudden the bill came
 
02:14:22.129 --> 02:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
back with that Amendment on it uh that
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
brought up this one percent but perhaps
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
there wasn't enough discussion and study
 
02:14:28.490 --> 02:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
with respect to that and she brought
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
this to the Forefront and this is why
 
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
we're here today all 10 sheriffs I can
 
02:14:34.609 --> 02:14:34.619 align:start position:0%
speak for unanimously agree that there
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be a better mechanism for
 
02:14:39.410 --> 02:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
raising these rates that is because a
 
02:14:41.870 --> 02:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
sheriff Wright testified it does help
 
02:14:44.089 --> 02:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
offset our revenues
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
um certainly Revenue goes up when the
 
02:14:47.209 --> 02:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
economy is not doing so well and
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
inflation is high revenues go down when
 
02:14:52.669 --> 02:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
things are more streamlined but a big
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
piece that I think also needs to be here
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
for the record is obviously we want to
 
02:14:59.569 --> 02:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
make sure our employees are being paid
 
02:15:01.609 --> 02:15:01.619 align:start position:0%
fairly competitively and their their
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
benefits are you know in the same boat
 
02:15:06.169 --> 02:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
so we're not losing them and of course
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
those things are voted on by the county
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
delegation at the end of the budget
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
cycle and these things have a
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
significant cost factor to them that
 
02:15:16.370 --> 02:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
none of us as managers like to see but
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
we know that it's there's a purpose for
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
it and it's it's a good thing so we
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
certainly don't bill out the way no
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
offense to anybody that's a member of
 
02:15:26.209 --> 02:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bar but a lawyer's
 
02:15:28.669 --> 02:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
office is going to bill you for all of
 
02:15:30.649 --> 02:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
those billable hours that they do and we
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
just simply have a fee structure to help
 
02:15:35.810 --> 02:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
offset these costs that are otherwise
 
02:15:37.850 --> 02:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
inherited by those of all of us the
 
02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:39.350 align:start position:0%
inherited by those of all of us the
taxpayers

02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:15:41.209 --> 02:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
thank you totally understood uh follow
 
02:15:41.219 --> 02:15:43.010 align:start position:0%
thank you totally understood uh follow
up

02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
actually uh representative Manchester
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sitting on our
 
02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
executive County Executive Board I
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
understand so this is going to help
 
02:15:58.729 --> 02:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
annual adjustment of the fee that will
 
02:16:01.609 --> 02:16:01.619 align:start position:0%
reflect what the
 
02:16:05.629 --> 02:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
fee or the CPI was based on the annual
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh changes correct you are absolutely
 
02:16:10.370 --> 02:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
correct it is the only mechanism I've
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
yet to hear of that might be more uh
 
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
conducive if you will to rather than
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
just coming to the legislature every uh
 
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
every year to say could you raise that
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
another five dollars another five
 
02:16:23.810 --> 02:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
dollars another five dollars and we had
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
waited 12 years before uh this this last
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill went through this might very well
 
02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
be the way to stabilize this if you will
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
put more of a tourniquet on it um so
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're certainly hopeful that uh your
 
02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
committee will uh stamp this is ought to
 
02:16:41.209 --> 02:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
pass and thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up a quick follow-up go
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah so will this
 
02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
in your mind or this will still keep the
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
local control of the counties to be able
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
to adjust as they need it yes you're
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
you're correct the the county delegation
 
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
reserves the right to either reject or
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
accept the request that I send it to my
 
02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners and obviously I want
 
02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
their support as lobbyists for the
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
sheriff's budget if you will
 
02:17:13.310 --> 02:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
um to represent um
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
they're good character as well as mine I
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
hope that the delegation would be
 
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
unanimous as the obviously the ultimate
 
02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
goal and um that I think is the
 
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
objective for all of the other nine
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
sheriffs in the county but you folks uh
 
02:17:28.310 --> 02:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
in your county duties that you do will
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
be the ones deciding on this if it's a
 
02:17:31.849 --> 02:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
year where it should be raised or
 
02:17:33.889 --> 02:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
perhaps shouldn't be raised
 
02:17:35.509 --> 02:17:35.519 align:start position:0%
and I also believe that this will be
 
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
more reflective of actually what's going
 
02:17:38.690 --> 02:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
on in the economy at that given time
 
02:17:40.610 --> 02:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
rather than just coming in with a one
 
02:17:43.129 --> 02:17:43.139 align:start position:0%
percent uh that doesn't cover costs or
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
or maybe it over covers costs so this
 
02:17:47.450 --> 02:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
gives that ability to actually take that
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
totality of it say this is act you know
 
02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
this year maybe we go up five percent
 
02:17:53.810 --> 02:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
next year we go down five percent we
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
don't know uh but at least we have a
 
02:17:59.450 --> 02:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
better picture of of how it's working
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh Yokel
 
02:18:04.669 --> 02:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
02:18:04.679 --> 02:18:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
question

02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of a two-part question
 
02:18:08.639 --> 02:18:09.230 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of a two-part question
um

02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
in reference to this the uh my question
 
02:18:14.929 --> 02:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
before when do you guys start
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
um drafting your budgets
 
02:18:18.889 --> 02:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:18:18.899 --> 02:18:19.490 align:start position:0%
um and
um

02:18:19.490 --> 02:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
you kept mentioning the um one percent
 
02:18:28.009 --> 02:18:28.019 align:start position:0%
um but there is no language in the
 
02:18:30.770 --> 02:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
current law or in the proposed law about
 
02:18:33.049 --> 02:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
one percent so I was just
 
02:18:34.730 --> 02:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
um wanted to give you an opportunity to
 
02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
explain where where that was coming from
 
02:18:40.250 --> 02:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
with respect to budget preparation my
 
02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
understanding is six of our counties out
 
02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
of the ten are on fiscal years and four
 
02:18:47.870 --> 02:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
are on calendar years so preparation is
 
02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:49.190 align:start position:0%
are on calendar years so preparation is
different

02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:18:50.810 --> 02:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
um mine is starting uh matter of fact
 
02:18:52.129 --> 02:18:52.139 align:start position:0%
it's on my calendar at the beginning of
 
02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
February that's how early we get going
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
to get to our commissioner's piece and
 
02:18:58.009 --> 02:18:58.019 align:start position:0%
then the executive committee's piece so
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
they'll have some time to ingest all
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
this and and work with us on these
 
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
matters uh with respect to your other
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
question as I thought I had alluded to
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
in my testimony before that one percent
 
02:19:10.849 --> 02:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
piece just kind of came out of nowhere
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
to us it came from somewhere uh in the
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
initial uh increase in the bills
 
02:19:16.679 --> 02:19:17.209 align:start position:0%
initial uh increase in the bills
um

02:19:17.209 --> 02:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:19.969 --> 02:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
uh Resurrection if you will from 2010
 
02:19:21.290 --> 02:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
when they increased it and we looked at
 
02:19:23.089 --> 02:19:23.099 align:start position:0%
the bottom and said what is this one
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
percent in June you know how does this
 
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
how does this work and obviously with
 
02:19:29.209 --> 02:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
the prices of everything going up I
 
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
certainly prepared a letter for my uh
 
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and delegation asking for
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
the support and that's how we got to to
 
02:19:37.129 --> 02:19:37.139 align:start position:0%
where we are and representative fellows
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh stepped in and said I really need to
 
02:19:41.450 --> 02:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
meet with all your sheriffs to discuss
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
this and educate all of you a little
 
02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
better and how the inflation pieces
 
02:19:48.610 --> 02:19:48.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
02:19:55.370 --> 02:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for coming
 
02:19:57.469 --> 02:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
today both of you and sharing
 
02:19:59.929 --> 02:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
information my question is in regards to
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
the CPI and I'm wondering if before this
 
02:20:06.349 --> 02:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
all conversation came about
 
02:20:07.849 --> 02:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
either one of you or both of you
 
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
understood what the CPI is and where it
 
02:20:11.090 --> 02:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
02:20:13.330 --> 02:20:13.340 align:start position:0%
well as representative fellows testified
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
there were many different cpis but CPI
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
as I understand it from being a
 
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining president in my
 
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
previous career
 
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
um is Consumer Price Index Northeast is
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
really what it what it comes down to and
 
02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:29.450 align:start position:0%
what is the
um

02:20:29.450 --> 02:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
that rate that's going to be set for
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
that for that year and it's one of those
 
02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
things that's usually set as kind of the
 
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
the center of you know where we're going
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
and where we want to be great thank you
 
02:20:45.650 --> 02:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:47.580 align:start position:0%

for your testimony representative
 
02:20:51.290 --> 02:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
fellows if you could take come back up
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
for one second please thank you
 
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:06.429 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:21:06.429 --> 02:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative power brought it up in
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
her questions uh regarding the Consumer
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
Price Index and
 
02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
um the website that she went to as well
 
02:21:20.650 --> 02:21:20.660 align:start position:0%
as I did and as she mentioned there's
 
02:21:24.410 --> 02:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
many many many different things so here
 
02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
you won't need that I don't think my
 
02:21:28.969 --> 02:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
only point was
 
02:21:28.979 --> 02:21:29.630 align:start position:0%
only point was
um

02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
on your chart that you gave out it says
 
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
CPI for all Urban consumers and then it
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
says down below series all items
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
Northeast Urban when I looked at the
 
02:21:38.399 --> 02:21:39.410 align:start position:0%
Northeast Urban when I looked at the
website

02:21:39.410 --> 02:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:40.190 align:start position:0%
website
um

02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
I kind of jotted down that I think on
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
line six it would be helpful if it said
 
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index all items for the
 
02:21:54.770 --> 02:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
urban consumers because it is there are
 
02:21:57.050 --> 02:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
if you leave if you just say com
 
02:21:59.330 --> 02:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
consumer price index that can be
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
interpreted a lot of ways and where your
 
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
chart your chart does basically what I
 
02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:07.250 align:start position:0%
chart your chart does basically what I
believe

02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
you should do to make this uh the best
 
02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
spill it can so by simply adding the
 
02:22:14.690 --> 02:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
words all items behind the words
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index I think that might
 
02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
be a nice Improvement
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I I understand what you're saying
 
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
what the reason that I use those words
 
02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
are those exact those are match the
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
words that are on here which are the
 
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
words that the um
 
02:22:38.690 --> 02:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
the Labor Statistics uses and what I
 
02:22:40.910 --> 02:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
will point to again it says if you go
 
02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:41.870 align:start position:0%
will point to again it says if you go
down

02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
down
um

02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:46.490 --> 02:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
under where it says series
 
02:22:50.330 --> 02:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
oh okay it says all items oh okay you
 
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
know I'd be fine with that because if
 
02:22:53.690 --> 02:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
you don't do that it leaves open to
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
interpretation uh you know is it the
 
02:22:59.210 --> 02:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
consumer right uh consumer index less
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
medical is it the consumer index less
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
fuel you know that kind of stuff so if
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
you just put the all items in there I
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
think that would be a a good
 
02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
clarification yeah on line six at the
 
02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
beginning of line six put in all items
 
02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
or maybe between five and six increase
 
02:23:17.809 --> 02:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
in after the words all items in the
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index yeah that I I think
 
02:23:23.389 --> 02:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
that that would be fine in I don't think
 
02:23:24.650 --> 02:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:25.370 align:start position:0%
it would be
um

02:23:25.370 --> 02:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
anyone would interpret that differently
 
02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
correct I just want to share with you
 
02:23:32.090 --> 02:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to share this it's a
 
02:23:34.969 --> 02:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
draft but what I did for
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
um that can be shared with the municipal
 
02:23:39.469 --> 02:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
Association and and anybody who's
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
interested is like three pages of
 
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
exactly how you go and find it
 
02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:44.710 align:start position:0%
exactly how you go and find it
because

02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
they're you can end up in different
 
02:23:50.270 --> 02:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
places and unless you're really familiar
 
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
with it you may be looking at something
 
02:23:54.889 --> 02:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
different for example there's there's
 
02:23:57.410 --> 02:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
this is Northeast Consumer Price Index
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's actually a New England price
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
index so if you weren't
 
02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
you know really nitpicking the words you
 
02:24:08.809 --> 02:24:08.819 align:start position:0%
could easily confuse those two so and
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately it will still be under the
 
02:24:12.650 --> 02:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
purview of the county delegation to give
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
the final Authority anyway so but I just
 
02:24:16.730 --> 02:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
think adding that would yeah do you
 
02:24:18.410 --> 02:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
would you like me to draft something I
 
02:24:25.130 --> 02:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.610 --> 02:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
I don't see
 
02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:31.670 align:start position:0%
I don't see
um

02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
did we I just wanted to apologize to the
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
chair and the committee of referencing
 
02:24:40.490 --> 02:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
my Sheriff who was here to testify but
 
02:24:42.170 --> 02:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
due to the lateness of your beginning he
 
02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
had another obligation and had to leave
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
oh that's so sorry for misleading you no
 
02:24:50.809 --> 02:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
it's fine okay I see no more cards or
 
02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
comments on this
 
02:24:57.650 --> 02:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
so I will close the hearing on HB 36 we
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
um so we will uh
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
return here at 1 30 to start our
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon of bills with representative
 
02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:12.650 align:start position:0%
afternoon of bills with representative
Aarons

02:25:12.650 --> 02:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
Aarons
 
03:29:07.750 --> 03:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:10.190 --> 03:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
we're gonna get roll in here we're going
 
03:29:13.130 --> 03:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
to start open up the
 
03:29:16.610 --> 03:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
House Bill 41 relative to public notice
 
03:29:19.490 --> 03:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
of meetings for County conventions
 
03:29:21.650 --> 03:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron you have the floor
 
03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:35.330 --> 03:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chair and
 
03:29:38.450 --> 03:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you members of Municipal County
 
03:29:42.410 --> 03:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
for hearing this bill and subsequent
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
ones which I will be introducing
 
03:29:48.650 --> 03:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm bringing to you today house bill
 
03:29:48.660 --> 03:29:51.769 align:start position:0%
so I'm bringing to you today house bill
41.

03:29:51.769 --> 03:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:54.650 --> 03:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
and this bill changes County Convention
 
03:29:57.410 --> 03:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
meeting notice requirements and require
 
03:29:59.450 --> 03:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
seven days notice of supplemental
 
03:30:01.309 --> 03:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation public hearings to be
 
03:30:03.950 --> 03:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
published in a daily newspaper
 
03:30:06.229 --> 03:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
the current County statute seems to be
 
03:30:08.650 --> 03:30:08.660 align:start position:0%
in conflict with other parts of Statute
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the point of this legislation is to
 
03:30:13.790 --> 03:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
fix that and clean do some cleaning up
 
03:30:17.690 --> 03:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
in in statutes so that things match
 
03:30:19.610 --> 03:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
for our County Convention a few months
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
ago in deciding about bonding there was
 
03:30:24.950 --> 03:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
much confusion about how to notice the
 
03:30:26.450 --> 03:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
meeting properly because of the
 
03:30:28.490 --> 03:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
conflicting statutes
 
03:30:30.889 --> 03:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
the bond attorney told us not to go by
 
03:30:33.530 --> 03:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
the 91a requirements
 
03:30:35.950 --> 03:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:30:38.570 --> 03:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County Manager Derek furland
 
03:30:41.929 --> 03:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
behind me here will explain further some
 
03:30:43.969 --> 03:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
of the confusion that that was met with
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
that I know other
 
03:30:49.309 --> 03:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
um Counties have also had similar
 
03:30:53.450 --> 03:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
concerns with what part of Statute they
 
03:30:56.269 --> 03:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
needed to follow with regard to noticing
 
03:30:56.279 --> 03:30:58.429 align:start position:0%
needed to follow with regard to noticing
meetings

03:30:58.429 --> 03:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
03:31:00.889 --> 03:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
so the first part of this bill repealing
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 24 not colon 9--d
 
03:31:06.290 --> 03:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
that's because it's in direct
 
03:31:10.790 --> 03:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
contradiction to RSA 91-a colon 2.
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
the County Convention quote unquote is
 
03:31:16.250 --> 03:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
the name for the legislative body of a
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
county and according to 91a colon 1 dash
 
03:31:21.120 --> 03:31:22.010 align:start position:0%
county and according to 91a colon 1 dash
a

03:31:22.010 --> 03:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
V1 section d
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
the quote legislative body of a County
 
03:31:31.550 --> 03:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
is included in an indefinition different
 
03:31:34.729 --> 03:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
definition of a public body and should
 
03:31:37.010 --> 03:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
therefore follow the guideline the
 
03:31:40.010 --> 03:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
guidance in RSA 91a unless specific
 
03:31:42.410 --> 03:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
instances require special meeting notice
 
03:31:42.420 --> 03:31:43.729 align:start position:0%
instances require special meeting notice
procedures

03:31:43.729 --> 03:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
examples of these specific instances
 
03:31:48.349 --> 03:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
include public hearings for County bonds
 
03:31:52.849 --> 03:31:52.859 align:start position:0%
as per RSA 33 colon 10. as well as
 
03:31:55.370 --> 03:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
supplemental Appropriations as per RSA
 
03:31:59.870 --> 03:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
24 colon 14-a if the suggestion above is
 
03:31:59.880 --> 03:32:01.190 align:start position:0%
24 colon 14-a if the suggestion above is
implemented

03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
03:32:03.590 --> 03:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
furthermore the rationale for only
 
03:32:05.630 --> 03:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
noticing meetings for two days if the
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
general court is in session isn't really
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
clear as to why that would make a
 
03:32:12.610 --> 03:32:12.620 align:start position:0%
difference and appears to be outdated
 
03:32:16.910 --> 03:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
therefore the recommendation is would be
 
03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
to change make this change in the
 
03:32:21.889 --> 03:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
language and the second part changing
 
03:32:25.250 --> 03:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
the language in 24 colon 14a this
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
clarifies the noticing requirements for
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
public hearings associated with
 
03:32:31.490 --> 03:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
supplemental Appropriations and the
 
03:32:33.410 --> 03:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
verbiage matches the public hearing
 
03:32:37.130 --> 03:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
language in RSA 33 colon 10 for Co for
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
County bonds
 
03:32:43.130 --> 03:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
so it's pretty much trying to what we
 
03:32:46.490 --> 03:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
want to do is is match up the
 
03:32:49.969 --> 03:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
noticing requirements uh seven days
 
03:32:52.429 --> 03:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
versus 24 hours
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:32:54.239 --> 03:32:55.849 align:start position:0%
and uh
and that's

03:32:55.849 --> 03:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:01.849 --> 03:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:03.950 --> 03:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
um do you have any written testimony
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
that you'll be submitting or I just have
 
03:33:11.570 --> 03:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
you know what I read to you right now
 
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to hand that in I can do
 
03:33:16.610 --> 03:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
that electronically if that helps you
 
03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
better and I'll do that when I get home
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
if you could that'd be great sure any
 
03:33:25.309 --> 03:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative ninja putty
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:33:27.359 --> 03:33:27.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
have in some communities there you know
 
03:33:35.929 --> 03:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
you talk about the newspaper circulation
 
03:33:38.330 --> 03:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
some communities have no newspaper
 
03:33:41.870 --> 03:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's on a daily basis so what we get
 
03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
is seven day old or
 
03:33:49.790 --> 03:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
you know so how do you reconcile the
 
03:33:51.170 --> 03:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
03:33:53.450 --> 03:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
not every Community has a daily
 
03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:00.500 --> 03:34:00.510 align:start position:0%
uh well as far as I understand
 
03:34:00.510 --> 03:34:00.950 align:start position:0%
uh well as far as I understand
[Music]

03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:34:00.960 --> 03:34:03.790 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:34:03.790 --> 03:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know we could make
 
03:34:10.849 --> 03:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
changes to reflect you know more current
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
that if it's on someone's website
 
03:34:16.370 --> 03:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
or you know update the statute further
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
to reflect the fact that um you know
 
03:34:24.290 --> 03:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.030 --> 03:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis
 
03:34:27.710 --> 03:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:34:34.010 --> 03:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
um in 2018 this Committee in fact passed
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
a bill that dealt with that specific
 
03:34:39.410 --> 03:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
issue and I'm I'm wondering if you might
 
03:34:41.210 --> 03:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at it and consider
 
03:34:44.030 --> 03:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
adding some of the language in it it is
 
03:34:49.130 --> 03:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire RSA 675 colon 7.
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
and uh it's under the requirements for
 
03:34:53.090 --> 03:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
03:34:56.210 --> 03:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
and it's it mentions daily newspapers
 
03:34:58.969 --> 03:34:58.979 align:start position:0%
but it also mentions websites where the
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
information needs to be posted on a
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
website and for how long there's we we
 
03:35:06.170 --> 03:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
spent a long time on this bill
 
03:35:08.809 --> 03:35:08.819 align:start position:0%
and we felt that we had covered all the
 
03:35:12.410 --> 03:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
bases it was bipartisan Bill supported
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
by pretty much everyone
 
03:35:17.210 --> 03:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
um so I just I offer that as a as a
 
03:35:19.490 --> 03:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
question as if you might want to take a
 
03:35:21.950 --> 03:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
look at that and consider using some of
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
that language too thank you very much
 
03:35:26.929 --> 03:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
what was the RSA number again 675 colon
 
03:35:26.939 --> 03:35:29.690 align:start position:0%
what was the RSA number again 675 colon
1.

03:35:29.690 --> 03:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I will take a look at
 
03:35:37.130 --> 03:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.050 --> 03:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
03:35:40.969 --> 03:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:35:43.309 --> 03:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative so my
 
03:35:45.170 --> 03:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
question pertains to
 
03:35:45.180 --> 03:35:49.729 align:start position:0%
question pertains to
um

03:35:49.729 --> 03:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
the first part uh the first section of
 
03:35:56.450 --> 03:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
the this bill line one my marked up copy
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
did does not have line numbers so I
 
03:36:02.690 --> 03:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
apologize so specifically it's um with
 
03:36:06.110 --> 03:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
regard to the repealing that section and
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
so 24 colon 9--d pertains to the notice
 
03:36:11.520 --> 03:36:13.150 align:start position:0%
so 24 colon 9--d pertains to the notice
of

03:36:13.150 --> 03:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:36:16.969 --> 03:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
the um meeting of the convention or the
 
03:36:16.979 --> 03:36:18.050 align:start position:0%
the um meeting of the convention or the
delegation

03:36:18.050 --> 03:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
03:36:20.929 --> 03:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
so why is that being repealed it's not
 
03:36:22.429 --> 03:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
being repealed entirely it's being
 
03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
replaced rep well yeah repealed and
 
03:36:25.200 --> 03:36:27.110 align:start position:0%
replaced rep well yeah repealed and
reenacted

03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
reenacted
 
03:36:31.010 --> 03:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
um so 24 colon 9--d would read notice
 
03:36:33.410 --> 03:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
period unless otherwise specified
 
03:36:35.210 --> 03:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
meetings shall be noticed in accordance
 
03:36:40.250 --> 03:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
with RSA 91 colon a uh Dash a colon 2.
 
03:36:41.630 --> 03:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
03:36:46.010 --> 03:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
the the that whole section is not being
 
03:36:50.269 --> 03:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:52.910 --> 03:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up thank you Mr chair I and I
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to
 
03:36:56.510 --> 03:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
um get my whole question out I'm sorry
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
so um I understand that
 
03:37:04.849 --> 03:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
and my I could you please explain the
 
03:37:08.990 --> 03:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
necessity to repeal and replace thereby
 
03:37:11.229 --> 03:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
following RSA
 
03:37:14.809 --> 03:37:14.819 align:start position:0%
91-8 colon 2 what is insufficient with
 
03:37:18.530 --> 03:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
regard to the provision under the
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
section of our New Hampshire statutes
 
03:37:24.070 --> 03:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
Title II counties
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the notice of
 
03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
County delegations
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
what is insufficient with that section
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
that that has to be repealed and
 
03:37:37.849 --> 03:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
reenacted in a pointer pointing towards
 
03:37:40.849 --> 03:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
91a thank you
 
03:37:43.370 --> 03:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
because we're matching up we're we're
 
03:37:46.250 --> 03:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
taking out the seven day
 
03:37:46.260 --> 03:37:47.330 align:start position:0%
taking out the seven day
um

03:37:47.330 --> 03:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
the seven day notice and matching it
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
with what 91 a recommends as specified
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
that because
 
03:38:02.690 --> 03:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:06.050 --> 03:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
because the County Convention is a
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
just like what is pointed to in 91a
 
03:38:12.720 --> 03:38:22.790 align:start position:0%
just like what is pointed to in 91a
so

03:38:22.790 --> 03:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.090 --> 03:38:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:33.590 --> 03:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no more thank you representative
 
03:38:35.150 --> 03:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
Aaron we will see you in a few minutes
 
03:38:35.160 --> 03:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
Aaron we will see you in a few minutes
yep

03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.190 --> 03:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and once again uh
 
03:39:03.290 --> 03:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh Derek Ferlin
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County Manager uh testifying
 
03:39:08.330 --> 03:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
here in support of of house bill 41. I
 
03:39:09.889 --> 03:39:09.899 align:start position:0%
don't have much to add
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
um from representative Aaron's uh
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
thorough introduction of the bill just
 
03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
to Simply reiterate that this is purely
 
03:39:17.950 --> 03:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
a matter of of consistency
 
03:39:21.229 --> 03:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
with the various references to the
 
03:39:23.990 --> 03:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
required notice for a delegation meeting
 
03:39:27.889 --> 03:39:27.899 align:start position:0%
so what this does is
 
03:39:29.929 --> 03:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
um when the matters of public hearing
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
related to Appropriations whether it's a
 
03:39:34.849 --> 03:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
supplemental appropriation in 2414 or a
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
bond hearing in accordance with RSA 3310
 
03:39:39.650 --> 03:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
um just consistent that there's a seven
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
day notice for those actions whereas a
 
03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
quote unquote standard delegation
 
03:39:46.969 --> 03:39:46.979 align:start position:0%
meeting would simply comply with 91a so
 
03:39:48.530 --> 03:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's just a little bit cleaner I think
 
03:39:50.929 --> 03:39:50.939 align:start position:0%
and more consistent I would also point
 
03:39:52.190 --> 03:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
out that in the supplemental
 
03:39:56.290 --> 03:39:56.300 align:start position:0%
appropriation section which is 24
 
03:40:00.349 --> 03:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
14-a prior to this suggested change
 
03:40:04.750 --> 03:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
there was no reference to a required
 
03:40:07.250 --> 03:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
noticing period so again just
 
03:40:08.809 --> 03:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
consistency across the board that when
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's a public hearing relative to
 
03:40:12.050 --> 03:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
Appropriations now it's seven days
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
across the board otherwise it would just
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:26.269 --> 03:40:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
we do not have any more pink cards up
 
03:40:37.250 --> 03:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
here is there anybody else who had
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:43.250 --> 03:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none we'll close the hearing
 
03:40:46.849 --> 03:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
on HP 41 HP 43 will be up in just a few
 
03:40:46.859 --> 03:43:37.990 align:start position:0%
on HP 41 HP 43 will be up in just a few
moments

03:43:37.990 --> 03:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:43.849 --> 03:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
just a reminder everybody in the room
 
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
when we are in between bills we are
 
03:43:50.690 --> 03:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
still on being recorded just for for
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
your information whether or not
 
03:43:55.250 --> 03:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
you care about that or not but we are
 
03:44:02.690 --> 03:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.429 --> 03:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
okay it is a 1 45 open up the hearing on
 
03:44:11.210 --> 03:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
HB 30 uh 43
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
relative to County Commissioners custody
 
03:44:18.170 --> 03:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
and care of all property
 
03:44:26.349 --> 03:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:26.359 --> 03:44:28.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:32.090 --> 03:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
um so this is uh HB 43 an act relative
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
to County Commissioners custody and care
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
of all property
 
03:44:38.330 --> 03:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
this bill removes references to
 
03:44:40.250 --> 03:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
ratifications by the County Convention
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
and renders the custody and care of all
 
03:44:45.290 --> 03:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
property belonging to the county to the
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners
 
03:44:52.010 --> 03:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
as per specified in 28 colon 4.
 
03:44:55.010 --> 03:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
28 colon 4 reads
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
custody of property under County
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the county commissioner
 
03:45:00.889 --> 03:45:00.899 align:start position:0%
shall have the custody and care of all
 
03:45:03.290 --> 03:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
property belonging to the county
 
03:45:03.300 --> 03:45:08.450 align:start position:0%
property belonging to the county
period

03:45:08.450 --> 03:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.460 --> 03:45:09.769 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:45:09.769 --> 03:45:09.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:09.779 --> 03:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
so
accordingly

03:45:11.990 --> 03:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
03:45:15.530 --> 03:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
should they not be required to get
 
03:45:17.570 --> 03:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
subsequent approval from the delegation
 
03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
in performing one of their functions
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
this is an executive branch of the
 
03:45:22.739 --> 03:45:24.370 align:start position:0%
this is an executive branch of the
government

03:45:24.370 --> 03:45:24.380 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:45:29.330 --> 03:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
this also links 28 colon 8--d and 28
 
03:45:32.570 --> 03:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
colon 8-a for the threshold where
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding that is required for
 
03:45:35.279 --> 03:45:36.650 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding that is required for
uh

03:45:36.650 --> 03:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:39.050 --> 03:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
acquisition or property
 
03:45:41.090 --> 03:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
the thought here
 
03:45:43.969 --> 03:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
is that since RSA 28 colon 4 places
 
03:45:45.710 --> 03:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
custody and care of all property
 
03:45:48.349 --> 03:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
belonging to the county squarely in the
 
03:45:50.690 --> 03:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
hands of County Commissioners
 
03:45:54.710 --> 03:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
based on RSA 28 colon 4 they shouldn't
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
require subsequent approval from the
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
delegation for various transactions
 
03:46:01.490 --> 03:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners are also elected by
 
03:46:03.410 --> 03:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
the people to make decisions regarding
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
custody and care of County Land
 
03:46:08.809 --> 03:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
that is one of their functions
 
03:46:11.750 --> 03:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
if they require oversight then shouldn't
 
03:46:12.830 --> 03:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
that come directly from their
 
03:46:12.840 --> 03:46:14.750 align:start position:0%
that come directly from their
constituents

03:46:14.750 --> 03:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
03:46:16.490 --> 03:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
the County Commissioners already are
 
03:46:19.010 --> 03:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
bound by what they are budgeted and that
 
03:46:21.170 --> 03:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
is a financial oversight that the county
 
03:46:23.330 --> 03:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
delegation should have
 
03:46:25.250 --> 03:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
within that budget shouldn't the County
 
03:46:26.929 --> 03:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
Commissioners be able to make decisions
 
03:46:29.330 --> 03:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the county as
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
they are directed to
 
03:46:34.130 --> 03:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
nrsa 28 colon 4 regarding custody and
 
03:46:36.229 --> 03:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
care of property
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
the other argument is with regard to
 
03:46:40.250 --> 03:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
many times competitive bids move faster
 
03:46:45.889 --> 03:46:45.899 align:start position:0%
than it is possible to arrange to
 
03:46:48.610 --> 03:46:48.620 align:start position:0%
convene a County Convention delegation
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
and or EFC meeting executive finance
 
03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee meeting
 
03:46:56.710 --> 03:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
many good deals benefiting the taxpayer
 
03:47:01.130 --> 03:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
might be lost or to have been lost if
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
the ratification cannot be obtained in a
 
03:47:04.670 --> 03:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
timely manner
 
03:47:06.590 --> 03:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
and that's been a problem I guess for
 
03:47:08.690 --> 03:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
some of the counties
 
03:47:11.570 --> 03:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
so um that's all I want to say basically
 
03:47:14.330 --> 03:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill I would defer
 
03:47:16.269 --> 03:47:16.279 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
comments regarding the bill to a County
 
03:47:22.250 --> 03:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
Commission a County Manager Derek
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
ferland from Sullivan County behind me
 
03:47:28.490 --> 03:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative am I
 
03:47:30.050 --> 03:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
understanding that you would prefer not
 
03:47:32.450 --> 03:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
to take questions I would be happy to
 
03:47:34.849 --> 03:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
field question sure just making sure
 
03:47:34.859 --> 03:47:36.889 align:start position:0%
field question sure just making sure
representative

03:47:36.889 --> 03:47:36.899 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:38.570 --> 03:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:47:40.790 --> 03:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question
 
03:47:40.800 --> 03:47:42.170 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question
so

03:47:42.170 --> 03:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask a question about that
 
03:47:47.570 --> 03:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
kind of the whole panoply of Sullivan
 
03:47:49.490 --> 03:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
County bills that are coming before us
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to ask if Sullivan
 
03:47:53.870 --> 03:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
County has bylaws
 
03:47:56.269 --> 03:47:56.279 align:start position:0%
that govern its operations I don't know
 
03:47:58.190 --> 03:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
that they do I know they have
 
03:47:58.200 --> 03:47:58.849 align:start position:0%
that they do I know they have
um

03:47:58.849 --> 03:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:02.690 --> 03:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
they have their own set of rules which
 
03:48:04.670 --> 03:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
they operate
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
more and more counties in New Hampshire
 
03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
are adopting bylaws that empower the
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the the delegation to
 
03:48:17.690 --> 03:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
do to conduct The Daily Business of the
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
of County government without having to
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
come before the legislature and and do
 
03:48:24.910 --> 03:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
this tedious thing of
 
03:48:27.530 --> 03:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
slightly amending a bill here and a bill
 
03:48:31.250 --> 03:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
there and I wondered if that might be
 
03:48:34.729 --> 03:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
down the road a solution to some of the
 
03:48:36.590 --> 03:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
issues that are facing you because
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
traditionally in this committee
 
03:48:43.250 --> 03:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
we are reluctant to
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
to rule on matters that affect one
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
County or a problem that one county is
 
03:48:52.490 --> 03:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
having but it's not being experienced by
 
03:48:55.010 --> 03:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
other counties and by changing the
 
03:48:55.020 --> 03:48:55.969 align:start position:0%
other counties and by changing the
overall

03:48:55.969 --> 03:48:55.979 align:start position:0%
overall
 
03:48:55.979 --> 03:48:57.410 align:start position:0%
overall
statute

03:48:57.410 --> 03:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:48:59.990 --> 03:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
that that change is going to perhaps
 
03:49:02.269 --> 03:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
cause Downstream problems for other
 
03:49:05.450 --> 03:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
counties so we have traditionally kind
 
03:49:08.330 --> 03:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
of aired on the side of wanting
 
03:49:11.690 --> 03:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
County government to be
 
03:49:11.700 --> 03:49:12.229 align:start position:0%
County government to be
um

03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
not affected by the individual
 
03:49:18.349 --> 03:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
day-to-day happenings of any particular
 
03:49:20.570 --> 03:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
County and so that's why I'm just
 
03:49:20.580 --> 03:49:21.950 align:start position:0%
County and so that's why I'm just
recommending

03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
recommending
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about adopting bylaws that
 
03:49:26.210 --> 03:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
would allow you to do all of these
 
03:49:27.769 --> 03:49:27.779 align:start position:0%
things that you you need to do
 
03:49:27.779 --> 03:49:29.389 align:start position:0%
things that you you need to do
understood

03:49:29.389 --> 03:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
understood
 
03:49:31.849 --> 03:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:49:33.769 --> 03:49:33.779 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
03:49:33.779 --> 03:49:39.469 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
representative

03:49:39.469 --> 03:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:39.479 --> 03:49:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:44.030 --> 03:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
03:49:44.040 --> 03:49:45.229 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
question

03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:49:45.239 --> 03:49:46.429 align:start position:0%
question
um

03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
when you're referencing the the
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
um other part of the law that says that
 
03:49:54.229 --> 03:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
they are kind of stewards of the
 
03:49:54.239 --> 03:49:55.670 align:start position:0%
they are kind of stewards of the
property

03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
um well why do you or what what language
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
in there leads you to believe that they
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
should be able to dispose of the
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:09.650 --> 03:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
well custody and care of all property
 
03:50:11.450 --> 03:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that include disposition as
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.269 --> 03:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
03:50:22.729 --> 03:50:22.739 align:start position:0%
before you leave representative I have a
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
couple questions for you please
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
um first one is in your opinion would
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
this eliminate the oversight and in some
 
03:50:33.050 --> 03:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
regards transparency
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.510 --> 03:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I the county delegation
 
03:50:49.130 --> 03:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
would still know what is going going on
 
03:50:51.650 --> 03:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
or what the plans are I would imagine I
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
don't know that this would
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
um you know remove any kind of
 
03:50:54.840 --> 03:50:58.570 align:start position:0%
um you know remove any kind of
transparency

03:50:58.570 --> 03:50:58.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:01.010 --> 03:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:51:01.020 --> 03:51:06.290 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

03:51:06.290 --> 03:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.929 --> 03:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
03:51:12.910 --> 03:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the the RSA and the the bill
 
03:51:17.450 --> 03:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
is there a Dollar limitation on say the
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
sales of real property in other words if
 
03:51:21.050 --> 03:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:51:24.050 --> 03:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
two hundred dollars or ten thousand
 
03:51:26.510 --> 03:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
dollars or ten million dollars or a
 
03:51:28.010 --> 03:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars
 
03:51:28.020 --> 03:51:29.630 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars
would

03:51:29.630 --> 03:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:51:32.809 --> 03:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
this let's just use the 100 million
 
03:51:35.809 --> 03:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
dollar property without the existing
 
03:51:35.819 --> 03:51:37.610 align:start position:0%
dollar property without the existing
language

03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:51:38.990 --> 03:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
would that hundred million dollar
 
03:51:42.410 --> 03:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
property be able to be sold on be by the
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
by a vote of the County Commissioners
 
03:51:48.410 --> 03:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:51.769 --> 03:51:51.779 align:start position:0%
possibly I don't know I would defer that
 
03:51:53.809 --> 03:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
question to uh
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
to my County Manager thank you thank you
 
03:52:00.170 --> 03:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
for the questions Josh uh representative
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh yokella thank you and thank you for
 
03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
taking uh this question you you uh were
 
03:52:08.090 --> 03:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
talking about how
 
03:52:10.910 --> 03:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
um you know having this oversight
 
03:52:13.849 --> 03:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
um and needing the
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
um delegation to approve of
 
03:52:17.399 --> 03:52:19.490 align:start position:0%
um delegation to approve of
um

03:52:19.490 --> 03:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:23.150 --> 03:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
um the sale of this information would
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
not be timely because of the notice
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
requirements and stuff like that but in
 
03:52:31.210 --> 03:52:31.220 align:start position:0%
the previous bill you seek to
 
03:52:34.070 --> 03:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
change the seven day requirement to 24
 
03:52:35.929 --> 03:52:35.939 align:start position:0%
hours and so
 
03:52:35.939 --> 03:52:37.010 align:start position:0%
hours and so
thing

03:52:37.010 --> 03:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:52:39.410 --> 03:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
do you believe that 24 hours is not
 
03:52:39.420 --> 03:52:40.790 align:start position:0%
do you believe that 24 hours is not
enough

03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
enough
 
03:52:40.800 --> 03:52:41.630 align:start position:0%
enough
um

03:52:41.630 --> 03:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
time frame for
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
the oversight to occur
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
well this particular Bill assumes the
 
03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:58.130 --> 03:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
I mean you know in terms of noticing
 
03:52:58.140 --> 03:52:59.690 align:start position:0%
I mean you know in terms of noticing
requirements

03:52:59.690 --> 03:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:52:59.700 --> 03:53:00.769 align:start position:0%
requirements
it

03:53:00.769 --> 03:53:00.779 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:53:06.590 --> 03:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:09.710 --> 03:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:12.349 --> 03:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
 
03:53:15.170 --> 03:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:53:20.530 --> 03:53:20.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.849 --> 03:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
counties typically have a lot of
 
03:53:28.550 --> 03:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
buildings and property
 
03:53:30.769 --> 03:53:30.779 align:start position:0%
that's their asset
 
03:53:34.990 --> 03:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
to not have the county delegation
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
oversee representative Manchester is
 
03:53:41.229 --> 03:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
there a question yes so let's just let's
 
03:53:44.809 --> 03:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
suspend for a moment let's one of the
 
03:53:46.490 --> 03:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
issues that I want to be very clear of
 
03:53:48.410 --> 03:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
I've already mentioned once today is let
 
03:53:50.269 --> 03:53:50.279 align:start position:0%
in this committee let's keep our
 
03:53:53.570 --> 03:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
comments to questions of inquiry as much
 
03:53:55.190 --> 03:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
as possible I understand there are times
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
where you're going to have to do a
 
03:53:57.650 --> 03:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
little bit of a lead-in but let's keep
 
03:53:59.830 --> 03:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
it as much as we can to questions
 
03:54:02.570 --> 03:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
clarifying testimony thank you thank you
 
03:54:05.389 --> 03:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'll try to would this not take
 
03:54:09.050 --> 03:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
away the local control and the working
 
03:54:09.060 --> 03:54:10.910 align:start position:0%
away the local control and the working
of

03:54:10.910 --> 03:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:54:14.090 --> 03:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
the delegation body the county
 
03:54:16.610 --> 03:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
delegation and the Commissioners who are
 
03:54:19.010 --> 03:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
duly elected but
 
03:54:21.650 --> 03:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
not have that working relationship
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
giving power to one
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:33.650 --> 03:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
I think it strengthens the
 
03:54:35.929 --> 03:54:35.939 align:start position:0%
uh the original
 
03:54:39.849 --> 03:54:39.859 align:start position:0%
the RSA 28 colon 4
 
03:54:42.410 --> 03:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
that says County Commissioners shall
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
have the custody and care of all
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
property belonging to the county
 
03:54:50.450 --> 03:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
so it gives them the powers which were
 
03:54:57.530 --> 03:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:00.830 --> 03:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:15.650 --> 03:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
we had two pink cards filled out on HB
 
03:55:18.349 --> 03:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
41 was one of those
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be 43
 
03:55:25.370 --> 03:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right why don't you come up in test
 
03:55:28.790 --> 03:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
five and fill out another one because it
 
03:55:32.769 --> 03:55:32.779 align:start position:0%
was filled out as HB 41.
 
03:55:53.630 --> 03:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.689 --> 03:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
thanks again Mr chair and members of the
 
03:55:56.699 --> 03:55:57.710 align:start position:0%
thanks again Mr chair and members of the
committee

03:55:57.710 --> 03:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
um once again Derek Ferrell and Sullivan
 
03:56:01.370 --> 03:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
County Manager testifying in support of
 
03:56:03.769 --> 03:56:03.779 align:start position:0%
House Bill 43. uh
 
03:56:05.689 --> 03:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
I'd like to begin with just a brief
 
03:56:05.699 --> 03:56:06.889 align:start position:0%
I'd like to begin with just a brief
background

03:56:06.889 --> 03:56:06.899 align:start position:0%
background
 
03:56:06.899 --> 03:56:07.729 align:start position:0%
background
um

03:56:07.729 --> 03:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:09.830 --> 03:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
as to why I'm here for all six of these
 
03:56:12.050 --> 03:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
bills I was appointed to my position in
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
March of 2017. uh prior to that I was a
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
career officer in the United States Air
 
03:56:20.450 --> 03:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
Force and uh retired as a colonelin
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
earlier in 2017 and so I say that to say
 
03:56:24.410 --> 03:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
03:56:26.570 --> 03:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
um regulations they really matter
 
03:56:28.969 --> 03:56:28.979 align:start position:0%
um and when I got into my current job I
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
really have relied on the rsas as the
 
03:56:34.010 --> 03:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
Bible to help me learn about my current
 
03:56:36.410 --> 03:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
position current duties and so over the
 
03:56:38.210 --> 03:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
course of the last nearly six years I've
 
03:56:40.250 --> 03:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
just come across in the course of of
 
03:56:42.889 --> 03:56:42.899 align:start position:0%
Performing my duties things that I
 
03:56:44.929 --> 03:56:44.939 align:start position:0%
observed were either inconsistent or
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
unclear or contradictory and so these
 
03:56:50.510 --> 03:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
bills were really an effort to uh to
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
clean that up now to Representatives
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
Davis's previous question about bylaws
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh no we don't have bylaws specifically
 
03:56:59.809 --> 03:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
we do have policies that address issues
 
03:57:02.030 --> 03:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
that are either not quite covered or
 
03:57:03.889 --> 03:57:03.899 align:start position:0%
when we are more restrictive than the
 
03:57:05.689 --> 03:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
rsas but by and large we just tend to
 
03:57:08.870 --> 03:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
rely on the rsas to order to avoid being
 
03:57:11.150 --> 03:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
redundant and running risk of of
 
03:57:13.910 --> 03:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
operating outside the law so
 
03:57:13.920 --> 03:57:15.110 align:start position:0%
operating outside the law so
um

03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 43 really initially stemmed
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
from my research into the disposal of
 
03:57:23.570 --> 03:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
County property which uh I don't want to
 
03:57:25.010 --> 03:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
butcher your name representative is it
 
03:57:27.410 --> 03:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
yokella okay
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and that was a there's a 300
 
03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
threshold for that which we'll get to in
 
03:57:33.650 --> 03:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
a subsequent hearing and so when I was
 
03:57:35.689 --> 03:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
looking at the other applicable
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
references that's where I focused in on
 
03:57:41.210 --> 03:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
the word custody
 
03:57:42.830 --> 03:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
and then I was like well what does
 
03:57:44.450 --> 03:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
custody really mean and I think it kind
 
03:57:46.610 --> 03:57:46.620 align:start position:0%
of gets to your point words matter as we
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
all know and I can appreciate too that
 
03:57:51.170 --> 03:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
some of the the some of these bills that
 
03:57:53.210 --> 03:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
are submitted you have to be equal parts
 
03:57:56.809 --> 03:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
uh historian English major or uh
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
attorney and unfortunately I am neither
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
one of those uh I was an engineer but
 
03:58:03.710 --> 03:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
that seemed neither here nor there so I
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
think really the root cause and maybe
 
03:58:07.010 --> 03:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
some of the concern that this could
 
03:58:10.070 --> 03:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
provide the appearance that we're uh the
 
03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
executive branches is eroding some of
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
the authority of the legislative branch
 
03:58:16.610 --> 03:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
by uh reducing oversight and I just
 
03:58:18.349 --> 03:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
assure you that is that was never the
 
03:58:18.359 --> 03:58:19.849 align:start position:0%
assure you that is that was never the
intention

03:58:19.849 --> 03:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
intention
 
03:58:21.469 --> 03:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
um but I do think if you're going to do
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
a root cause analysis there's four terms
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
that I think need to be clarified and
 
03:58:26.090 --> 03:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
and maybe the addition of a definition
 
03:58:28.610 --> 03:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
section would provide that legislative
 
03:58:30.769 --> 03:58:30.779 align:start position:0%
intent and avoid any potential
 
03:58:32.210 --> 03:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings and those four terms
 
03:58:35.570 --> 03:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
are custody real estate real property
 
03:58:38.269 --> 03:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
and personal property because they all
 
03:58:40.370 --> 03:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
appear in the rsas both in chapter 24
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
which is the county convention chapter
 
03:58:44.389 --> 03:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
and chapter 28 which is the
 
03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner's chapter I thought it was
 
03:58:48.290 --> 03:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
interesting just trying to you know make
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
my own determination of what was the
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
legislative intent vis-a-vis the the two
 
03:58:53.809 --> 03:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
branches of government and how they
 
03:58:56.150 --> 03:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
would work together for these matters
 
03:58:57.410 --> 03:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
um I found it interesting that the word
 
03:58:59.570 --> 03:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
property does not appear in chapter 24
 
03:59:03.410 --> 03:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
at all real estate appears twice and it
 
03:59:05.389 --> 03:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
clearly provides the Authority for the
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
delegation to approve the purchase and
 
03:59:09.250 --> 03:59:09.260 align:start position:0%
sale of real estate
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
real property property and personal
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
property are all contained in chapter 28
 
03:59:16.370 --> 03:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
which is the commissioner's chapter
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
the problem that I see is that depending
 
03:59:20.689 --> 03:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
on which source you use the definition
 
03:59:23.210 --> 03:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
of real property sometimes can include
 
03:59:25.490 --> 03:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
land which I think can very quickly be
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
confused with real estate and as well as
 
03:59:30.410 --> 03:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
the more strict and I think rigid and I
 
03:59:32.210 --> 03:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
think uh more appropriate definition
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
which is things that are on the land
 
03:59:38.410 --> 03:59:38.420 align:start position:0%
that are immobile like buildings crops
 
03:59:41.769 --> 03:59:41.779 align:start position:0%
uh dams roads
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
whether they're built or natural and
 
03:59:45.830 --> 03:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
then that distinguishes from personal
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
property which are things that are
 
03:59:47.279 --> 03:59:48.349 align:start position:0%
property which are things that are
movable

03:59:48.349 --> 03:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
movable
 
03:59:48.359 --> 03:59:49.729 align:start position:0%
movable
so

03:59:49.729 --> 03:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
03:59:55.490 --> 03:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
I took a I guess legalistic view of the
 
03:59:57.710 --> 03:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
word custody which
 
03:59:57.720 --> 03:59:58.849 align:start position:0%
word custody which
um

03:59:58.849 --> 03:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:02.090 --> 04:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
I I tend to mean full legal control to
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
include the ability to dispose of of
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
real property but that it does
 
04:00:10.010 --> 04:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
distinguish real estate so
 
04:00:13.010 --> 04:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
I hope that background was at least
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
somewhat useful I do think if you look
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
at various case studies so what's a for
 
04:00:20.090 --> 04:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
instance a for instance would be last
 
04:00:22.610 --> 04:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
year we had a Timber Harvest on one of
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
our plots of land so to me Timber is
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
Real Property by the definition that I
 
04:00:30.710 --> 04:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
found online we did not go to the
 
04:00:33.769 --> 04:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
delegation for approval to dispose of
 
04:00:35.929 --> 04:00:35.939 align:start position:0%
that real property because it was just
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
run through our natural resources
 
04:00:40.790 --> 04:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
department if we were to sell or lease a
 
04:00:44.030 --> 04:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
parcel of land uh real estate then those
 
04:00:46.130 --> 04:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
all those actions we we actually review
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
our leases annually with the delegation
 
04:00:49.969 --> 04:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
uh in conjunction with our budget
 
04:00:53.330 --> 04:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
approval process if we were to sell a
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
building so the building is real
 
04:00:55.439 --> 04:00:56.389 align:start position:0%
building so the building is real
property

04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:00:58.969 --> 04:00:58.979 align:start position:0%
but it's sitting on land it would be
 
04:01:00.650 --> 04:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
impossible for the Commissioners to sell
 
04:01:02.750 --> 04:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
the building without also addressing uh
 
04:01:04.370 --> 04:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
the status the legal status of the land
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
under it so I think there'd be plenty of
 
04:01:08.330 --> 04:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity and oversight and
 
04:01:10.370 --> 04:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the two branches
 
04:01:13.130 --> 04:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
of government with respect to uh this
 
04:01:13.140 --> 04:01:23.570 align:start position:0%
of government with respect to uh this
RSA

04:01:23.570 --> 04:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
so 28 8C
 
04:01:28.309 --> 04:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
which is on the competitive bidding on
 
04:01:30.410 --> 04:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
sales and leases of real property
 
04:01:33.050 --> 04:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
again just getting back to just making a
 
04:01:35.090 --> 04:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
distinction between what is considered
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
real property versus what is real estate
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
and looking back at how those terms are
 
04:01:43.790 --> 04:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
used both in chapters 24 and 28.
 
04:01:43.800 --> 04:01:44.450 align:start position:0%
used both in chapters 24 and 28.
um

04:01:44.450 --> 04:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
and then on 28 8D section one
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
the use of real property again we have a
 
04:01:55.910 --> 04:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
one facility in our Unity campus that's
 
04:01:55.920 --> 04:01:56.809 align:start position:0%
one facility in our Unity campus that's
been

04:01:56.809 --> 04:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
um we've had in the past allowed the
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
public to use it for events and it's
 
04:02:03.530 --> 04:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
just rented out at a nominal you know
 
04:02:05.090 --> 04:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
fifty dollar fee which is basically the
 
04:02:06.950 --> 04:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
the security deposit to prevent from any
 
04:02:06.960 --> 04:02:08.689 align:start position:0%
the security deposit to prevent from any
damages

04:02:08.689 --> 04:02:08.699 align:start position:0%
damages
 
04:02:08.699 --> 04:02:09.590 align:start position:0%
damages
um

04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
that sort of arrangement has always been
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
traditionally the purview of the
 
04:02:14.330 --> 04:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and if we had to go to the
 
04:02:16.429 --> 04:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
delegation every time we wanted to have
 
04:02:18.170 --> 04:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
somebody have a birthday party um in
 
04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
that building that again that'd be
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
pretty unwieldy and just appreciating
 
04:02:23.809 --> 04:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
the extra time that it takes to uh to
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
convene a delegation and that's pretty
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
hard in Sullivan we only have 13 uh reps
 
04:02:29.150 --> 04:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
some of the other counties I would
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
imagine it'd be very very difficult
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
indeed so
 
04:02:34.370 --> 04:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
um I think there's any
 
04:02:36.769 --> 04:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
possible addition that might help clear
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
up some of this confusion it would just
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
be simply to add a definition section
 
04:02:43.370 --> 04:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
and make it Crystal Clear what the
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is and really
 
04:02:46.370 --> 04:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
distinguish between real estate real
 
04:02:46.380 --> 04:02:47.929 align:start position:0%
distinguish between real estate real
property

04:02:47.929 --> 04:02:47.939 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
um personal property and then as well as
 
04:02:52.610 --> 04:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
the concept of what does custody truly
 
04:02:54.410 --> 04:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
entail again because depending on the
 
04:02:56.330 --> 04:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
source you can find varying degrees of
 
04:02:57.950 --> 04:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
definition that you know there's a bit
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
of a spectrum it's not like there's a
 
04:03:01.550 --> 04:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know a black and white definition
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
for every one of these terms but
 
04:03:06.050 --> 04:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
just observations that I've come across
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
in the last five years and it's again I
 
04:03:10.250 --> 04:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
can appreciate it's between the the
 
04:03:12.110 --> 04:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
historical aspect of some of these rsas
 
04:03:13.969 --> 04:03:13.979 align:start position:0%
some of which date back to the early
 
04:03:16.250 --> 04:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
1900s or even earlier
 
04:03:16.260 --> 04:03:17.030 align:start position:0%
1900s or even earlier
um

04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
or the you know what is what do the
 
04:03:20.450 --> 04:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
words mean and then there's the the
 
04:03:23.330 --> 04:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
English major that I'm not or the
 
04:03:23.340 --> 04:03:24.290 align:start position:0%
English major that I'm not or the
attorney

04:03:24.290 --> 04:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
04:03:25.969 --> 04:03:25.979 align:start position:0%
um how would you how would you legally
 
04:03:28.490 --> 04:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
interpret these in in court and again I
 
04:03:29.330 --> 04:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
don't have any experience with that
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
either unfortunately
 
04:03:32.809 --> 04:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the testimony
 
04:03:37.849 --> 04:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
questions representative stavis
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:03:42.590 --> 04:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
taking yet another question
 
04:03:45.650 --> 04:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
you may have said this uh the sponsor
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
may have said this and I apologize if I
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
missed it but with this bill as with the
 
04:03:53.389 --> 04:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
others is there some substantive
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
material problem that you are attempting
 
04:03:58.849 --> 04:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
to fix other than perhaps some
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in the rsas is there some
 
04:04:04.010 --> 04:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
tangible issue that Sullivan County is
 
04:04:06.650 --> 04:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
facing but by making these changes to
 
04:04:10.510 --> 04:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
the rsas it will fix that problem
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of approximate cause no the
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
answer is no it's just it's simply
 
04:04:16.969 --> 04:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
housekeeping it's if we don't do it now
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
eventually when it does become there
 
04:04:20.210 --> 04:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
might be a situation down the road
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's in Sullivan or the other
 
04:04:23.570 --> 04:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
nine counties it's just simply in the
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
better the greater interest in the
 
04:04:27.170 --> 04:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
greater good to make sure that our rsas
 
04:04:29.330 --> 04:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
are as clean and consistent and accurate
 
04:04:31.130 --> 04:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
as possible for whether it's today or
 
04:04:37.370 --> 04:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:40.490 --> 04:04:40.500 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question

[Music]

04:04:44.809 --> 04:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:04:44.819 --> 04:04:45.950 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
is RSA 28 colon 6 a uh the definition of
 
04:04:54.650 --> 04:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding it's statutorily
 
04:04:56.929 --> 04:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
defined but I don't
 
04:04:59.210 --> 04:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
know if that's what's being referenced
 
04:04:59.220 --> 04:05:04.189 align:start position:0%
know if that's what's being referenced
here

04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Albert Albert
 
04:05:10.250 --> 04:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
was at 28 6A yes line five
 
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
it says competitive bidding
 
04:05:20.210 --> 04:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:20.220 --> 04:05:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
is that different from competitive
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
bidding that is statutorily defined I'm
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between
 
04:05:34.729 --> 04:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding
 
04:05:42.050 --> 04:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:44.929 --> 04:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
you said line five what which was the
 
04:05:48.590 --> 04:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
original reference I I see 28 6A but you
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
started somewhere else I'm just 28 6A
 
04:05:56.210 --> 04:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:58.130 --> 04:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
that is the authority to contract for
 
04:06:00.590 --> 04:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
professional Real Estate Services
 
04:06:00.600 --> 04:06:02.210 align:start position:0%
professional Real Estate Services
okay

04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
so competitive bidding is defined
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
somewhere I ran across it it
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
open competitive bidding for example
 
04:06:14.809 --> 04:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
so if you have
 
04:06:17.809 --> 04:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
a sale or a lease of real property and
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
you've accepted bids
 
04:06:23.870 --> 04:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
I don't see where there's a
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
urgency regarding time to to bring that
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:06:31.760 --> 04:06:31.770 align:start position:0%
commissioner delegation for ratification
 
04:06:31.770 --> 04:06:33.110 align:start position:0%
commissioner delegation for ratification
[Music]

04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:06:36.550 --> 04:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you know or
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
04:06:40.969 --> 04:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes things go really fast
 
04:06:43.490 --> 04:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
and but if you've
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
complied with the competitive bidding
 
04:06:49.689 --> 04:06:49.699 align:start position:0%
requirement for the states
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
where you have to publish then you have
 
04:06:54.769 --> 04:06:54.779 align:start position:0%
to accept the sealed bids and then it
 
04:06:57.889 --> 04:06:57.899 align:start position:0%
goes to you know a meeting and they open
 
04:07:01.250 --> 04:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
the bids and someone's awarded
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
why would that
 
04:07:05.090 --> 04:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
I mean the commission the delegation
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
meets quarterly
 
04:07:09.130 --> 04:07:09.140 align:start position:0%
I think yeah
 
04:07:12.110 --> 04:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't understand what the time
 
04:07:19.969 --> 04:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:22.490 --> 04:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
that would would make it necessarily to
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
take the power out of the delegation's
 
04:07:27.290 --> 04:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
hands and and put it strictly with the
 
04:07:27.300 --> 04:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
hands and and put it strictly with the
commissioners

04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
uh well it's it's quarterly and
 
04:07:35.090 --> 04:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of that happens in between
 
04:07:36.650 --> 04:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
that quarter
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
um could it be scheduled and
 
04:07:38.520 --> 04:07:39.710 align:start position:0%
um could it be scheduled and
synchronized

04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
synchronized
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
um sure then I think really now the
 
04:07:43.610 --> 04:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
issue gets back to what does the word
 
04:07:46.010 --> 04:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
custody mean and that I think that's you
 
04:07:48.050 --> 04:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
know maybe the other issue is is uh how
 
04:07:49.370 --> 04:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
much Authority do the Commissioners have
 
04:07:51.290 --> 04:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
when we say they have custody and
 
04:07:54.050 --> 04:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
control over over real property
 
04:07:55.250 --> 04:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
um then we have to agree on what the
 
04:07:57.290 --> 04:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
definition of custody means so it's
 
04:07:58.969 --> 04:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
really two parts it's the is it
 
04:07:58.979 --> 04:08:00.410 align:start position:0%
really two parts it's the is it
convenient

04:08:00.410 --> 04:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
convenient
 
04:08:00.420 --> 04:08:01.370 align:start position:0%
convenient
um

04:08:01.370 --> 04:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:03.769 --> 04:08:03.779 align:start position:0%
and then do we agree on the the
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
definition of the word custody okay
 
04:08:09.050 --> 04:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:10.550 --> 04:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
just a
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
um representative got three and one
 
04:08:13.610 --> 04:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
second just a reminder representative
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
Elward in the future
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
um after you ask a question a question
 
04:08:22.370 --> 04:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
and it's been answered just uh request a
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up question rather than having a
 
04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
back and forth discussion
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Adam Guthrie uh if
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
this would pass
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
04:08:37.370 --> 04:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh if this would pass
 
04:08:40.550 --> 04:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
would would it not take the authority of
 
04:08:44.030 --> 04:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
the executive committee and the uh the
 
04:08:46.370 --> 04:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh delegation
 
04:08:48.769 --> 04:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take their Authority out of the
 
04:08:52.689 --> 04:08:52.699 align:start position:0%
loop as far as any purchase or sale of
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
property and we may decide what property
 
04:08:59.150 --> 04:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
is but wouldn't wouldn't not take that
 
04:09:02.330 --> 04:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for the question
 
04:09:05.090 --> 04:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative I've got three I guess
 
04:09:06.590 --> 04:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's really the Crux of the issue is
 
04:09:08.210 --> 04:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
is what Authority
 
04:09:09.889 --> 04:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
and what was the intent of the way the
 
04:09:11.389 --> 04:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
rsas were written now as I said before
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
chapter 24 doesn't mention the word
 
04:09:16.490 --> 04:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
property at all so if we infer from that
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
that the legislative branch I.E the
 
04:09:21.130 --> 04:09:21.140 align:start position:0%
delegation was never really meant to be
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
custodians of the property and that
 
04:09:25.130 --> 04:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
Authority was reserved for the
 
04:09:26.689 --> 04:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as the executive branch
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
then I think we have to have a just a
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
dialogue about where the rules of the
 
04:09:32.510 --> 04:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
road are regarding the two branches of
 
04:09:33.769 --> 04:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
government and their respective you know
 
04:09:36.110 --> 04:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
where does their Authority meet and
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully not overlap and if it does
 
04:09:40.210 --> 04:09:40.220 align:start position:0%
overlap then it's in an acceptable
 
04:09:42.830 --> 04:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
manner to both branches I mean that's I
 
04:09:45.410 --> 04:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
didn't intend to provoke a uh branches
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
of government
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
um discussion but I do think those
 
04:09:50.090 --> 04:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
discussions probably are you know
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
necessary from time to time you know
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's an evolutionary nature to these
 
04:09:55.910 --> 04:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
rsas some of them which again they date
 
04:09:58.370 --> 04:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
back to when we had County farms and
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
right now only Grafton County still has
 
04:10:02.090 --> 04:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
a County farm so there's a lot in here
 
04:10:05.809 --> 04:10:05.819 align:start position:0%
that has changed and so as we change
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
with it just out of the necessary uh
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
course of doing our County government
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
business I just think these are the
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities that come up and without
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
trying to create additional
 
04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
administrative you know headaches to try
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
to you know change an apostrophe at a a
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
maybe a word choice change but I think
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
these are you know the relevant issues
 
04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
and we should discuss them so that way
 
04:10:27.650 --> 04:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
there's no misunderstandings on behalf
 
04:10:28.849 --> 04:10:28.859 align:start position:0%
of the Commissioners and the appointed
 
04:10:31.670 --> 04:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
staff and that we're not uh deemed to be
 
04:10:33.650 --> 04:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
encroaching on the authority and
 
04:10:35.570 --> 04:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility that's reserved for the
 
04:10:38.150 --> 04:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
legislative branch if I'll follow up Mr
 
04:10:40.370 --> 04:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
chairman absolutely Miss uh
 
04:10:42.349 --> 04:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie go ahead thank
 
04:10:45.950 --> 04:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
you are you saying that if I'm a count
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
if I'm in a county and they we have a
 
04:10:50.330 --> 04:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
building for sale
 
04:10:53.229 --> 04:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
that it's not clear to you that the
 
04:10:55.929 --> 04:10:55.939 align:start position:0%
executive committee and on the
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
delegation wants to have oversight on
 
04:10:58.920 --> 04:11:00.769 align:start position:0%
delegation wants to have oversight on
that

04:11:00.769 --> 04:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
I think Mr representative Guthrie I
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
think that's an entirely reasonable
 
04:11:04.199 --> 04:11:06.050 align:start position:0%
think that's an entirely reasonable
assumption

04:11:06.050 --> 04:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
04:11:07.610 --> 04:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I can just speak from Sullivan
 
04:11:09.530 --> 04:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
County's perspective I don't know when
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
we'll ever have a building for sale it
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
might happen someday but the building
 
04:11:15.050 --> 04:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
won't be sold unless the real estate
 
04:11:17.210 --> 04:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
under it is also part of that
 
04:11:19.610 --> 04:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
transaction and the real estate in my
 
04:11:21.530 --> 04:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
opinion is the trigger that's going to
 
04:11:23.530 --> 04:11:23.540 align:start position:0%
necessitate and mandate
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
oversight from the delegation you can't
 
04:11:28.130 --> 04:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
just sell the building without the
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
property or the land property here I am
 
04:11:33.530 --> 04:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
mixing terms without the land under it
 
04:11:35.090 --> 04:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
also being I would think part of that
 
04:11:37.010 --> 04:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
transaction so I think that that's where
 
04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
the two authorities I think they meet
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
perfectly together the real property is
 
04:11:43.189 --> 04:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
the building the land under it is the
 
04:11:45.410 --> 04:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
real estate the Commissioners have the
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
vertical component and the delegation is
 
04:11:50.210 --> 04:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
responsible for the horizontal component
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
so they would both need to be in the
 
04:11:56.689 --> 04:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
loop and on board with that transaction
 
04:12:00.410 --> 04:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.330 --> 04:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester
 
04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:12:06.769 --> 04:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
um is this solutions that's being looked
 
04:12:14.150 --> 04:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
at exclusively for Sullivan County or
 
04:12:16.250 --> 04:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
have you looked at how it's going to
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
I've had discussions with my my
 
04:12:25.969 --> 04:12:25.979 align:start position:0%
counterparts not every county has a
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
county manager or administrator but
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's generally somebody who serves in
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
that capacity so at the New Hampshire
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
Association of counties for the past
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
several years we had a separate strategy
 
04:12:38.570 --> 04:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
committee and one of the goals of that
 
04:12:40.610 --> 04:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
strategy committee was to identify among
 
04:12:41.769 --> 04:12:41.779 align:start position:0%
other things
 
04:12:46.849 --> 04:12:46.859 align:start position:0%
opportunities to clarify the rsas so a
 
04:12:50.929 --> 04:12:50.939 align:start position:0%
lot of this work that I observed from
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
just conducting my own business were
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
also issues that were discussed under
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
the auspices of the strategy committee
 
04:13:00.110 --> 04:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
so there has been county-wide awareness
 
04:13:02.090 --> 04:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
of these issues I wouldn't go so far as
 
04:13:03.769 --> 04:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
to say that they've all signed on
 
04:13:05.330 --> 04:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
because we didn't quite formally go
 
04:13:07.130 --> 04:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
through that process so I'm not saying
 
04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
they don't agree with it I can't say
 
04:13:10.729 --> 04:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
that they disagree or agree
 
04:13:12.650 --> 04:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
um so it that was the Clearinghouse
 
04:13:14.570 --> 04:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
originally where we were hoping to get a
 
04:13:17.210 --> 04:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
more formal New Hampshire Association of
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
County process to identify these issues
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then work with our respective state
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
representatives in our own counties to
 
04:13:27.650 --> 04:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
get them submitted as bills but we never
 
04:13:29.210 --> 04:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
quite got that far the strategy
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee has just for various reasons
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
not been able to uh to really meet as
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
often as they would like and and get as
 
04:13:39.170 --> 04:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
much work done but but the point I
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to make is uh there's been
 
04:13:43.250 --> 04:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
numerous conversations with my peers and
 
04:13:45.410 --> 04:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
so for just not just this bill but the
 
04:13:46.610 --> 04:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
other ones that we sponsor here today
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
and they all agree that it's it is
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
important to do some housekeeping and
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that the rsas are as clear and
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.130 --> 04:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up
 
04:14:01.309 --> 04:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up go ahead yeah
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's Sullivan County is the only County
 
04:14:07.309 --> 04:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's coming up with Clearing House of
 
04:14:07.319 --> 04:14:08.929 align:start position:0%
that's coming up with Clearing House of
housekeeping

04:14:08.929 --> 04:14:08.939 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
04:14:11.570 --> 04:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
are there any other counties that have
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
agreed and said the work was began but
 
04:14:17.150 --> 04:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
it wasn't completed so are any other
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
counties that are saying yes we need to
 
04:14:21.889 --> 04:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
reach out to are
 
04:14:23.630 --> 04:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
reps to
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:31.849 --> 04:14:31.859 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for any conversations that
 
04:14:33.889 --> 04:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
have taken place for in other counties I
 
04:14:35.469 --> 04:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
do know that this Bill had one other
 
04:14:39.410 --> 04:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor uh from Rockingham County
 
04:14:39.420 --> 04:14:40.250 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor uh from Rockingham County
um

04:14:40.250 --> 04:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:43.010 --> 04:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
so I you know without knowing the exact
 
04:14:44.689 --> 04:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
details and what the threshold is for
 
04:14:46.189 --> 04:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
how many different co-sponsors from
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
different counties it takes to really
 
04:14:49.490 --> 04:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
send a message that there's widespread
 
04:14:49.500 --> 04:14:50.929 align:start position:0%
send a message that there's widespread
agreement

04:14:50.929 --> 04:14:50.939 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:14:52.189 --> 04:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
um I can just tell you from my
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
conversations with my peers
 
04:14:56.269 --> 04:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
um that the my fellow administrators and
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
managers haven't disagreed with anything
 
04:15:00.590 --> 04:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
that we submitted it's just it comes
 
04:15:02.929 --> 04:15:02.939 align:start position:0%
down to who has time to do the work and
 
04:15:04.729 --> 04:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm the sucker that raised my
 
04:15:06.950 --> 04:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
hand and representative Aaron in
 
04:15:08.510 --> 04:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County has been gracious enough
 
04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
to sponsor as many bills as as I could
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
send her way and so I think that's
 
04:15:15.769 --> 04:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest reason why I'm here
 
04:15:17.450 --> 04:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
today and and she's the one that
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
sponsored all those bills I guess we're
 
04:15:22.189 --> 04:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
just a gluttons for punishment
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative service
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question thank you
 
04:15:28.550 --> 04:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:15:28.560 --> 04:15:29.630 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
um

04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
previous questioner mentioned how this
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
might affect other counties
 
04:15:36.650 --> 04:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
speaking as a member of the Grafton
 
04:15:39.050 --> 04:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
County delegation
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
striking the language about ratified by
 
04:15:44.410 --> 04:15:44.420 align:start position:0%
a majority vote of the County Convention
 
04:15:48.469 --> 04:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
it would never fly in Grafton County
 
04:15:51.650 --> 04:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
so it definitely would have an impact on
 
04:15:54.050 --> 04:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
other counties
 
04:15:54.060 --> 04:15:55.670 align:start position:0%
other counties
um

04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:59.150 --> 04:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I'm just looking more for
 
04:16:02.030 --> 04:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
along the lines of asking you
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
what was the nature of your conversation
 
04:16:06.830 --> 04:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
with your colleagues at the County
 
04:16:08.689 --> 04:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
commission level
 
04:16:11.090 --> 04:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
was it did it get into the nitty-gritty
 
04:16:13.130 --> 04:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
of this is the line we want to strike
 
04:16:16.370 --> 04:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
from this piece of legislation or this
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
is the broad umbrella under which we'd
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
like to make these changes would can you
 
04:16:25.490 --> 04:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.389 --> 04:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis uh
 
04:16:30.349 --> 04:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd say the answer is a little
 
04:16:31.490 --> 04:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
bit of both
 
04:16:33.650 --> 04:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
um the the more detailed discussions
 
04:16:35.570 --> 04:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
happened within the the context of the
 
04:16:36.769 --> 04:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
strategy committee so it wasn't
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily all 10 Representatives
 
04:16:40.929 --> 04:16:40.939 align:start position:0%
because the strategy committee
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes to have a corn we just needed
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
five and so if the debate was or the
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
discussion was with just five or six
 
04:16:46.920 --> 04:16:48.410 align:start position:0%
discussion was with just five or six
people

04:16:48.410 --> 04:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you when it came down to
 
04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
this specific
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
um Bill and again we focused on the word
 
04:16:55.490 --> 04:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
custody originally
 
04:16:57.410 --> 04:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
um one of the other uh one of my other
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
peers mentioned well let's go back and
 
04:17:00.769 --> 04:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
look at what the powers are that are
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
enumerated in RSA 24 colon 13 to the
 
04:17:07.610 --> 04:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
delegation and that's where you know he
 
04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
made the point that
 
04:17:12.410 --> 04:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's where the term real estate is
 
04:17:14.689 --> 04:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
used and notably the word property
 
04:17:16.130 --> 04:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
whether it's personal property real
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
property or just property writ large is
 
04:17:20.570 --> 04:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
not mentioned and so again we're we're
 
04:17:22.010 --> 04:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
trying to put our historical slash
 
04:17:23.450 --> 04:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
attorney hats on and say well what was
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
the original intent and it seems as
 
04:17:27.590 --> 04:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
though if there was a distinction that
 
04:17:29.269 --> 04:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
was intentional
 
04:17:32.150 --> 04:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
um that it's real estate is in the
 
04:17:34.490 --> 04:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
legislative branch and the real property
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
that's on top of that real estate is the
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
purview of the executive branch but but
 
04:17:40.130 --> 04:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
again that's
 
04:17:41.929 --> 04:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
you know it's impossible for any of us
 
04:17:43.490 --> 04:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
in this room to go back and really say
 
04:17:45.170 --> 04:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
with certainty but I think you can you
 
04:17:47.150 --> 04:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
know make an inference based on the
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
presence or absence of certain
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
terminology so I would say if
 
04:17:52.849 --> 04:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
if the assumption is that the
 
04:17:54.590 --> 04:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislative branch does have purview
 
04:17:56.570 --> 04:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
over will property then my question
 
04:17:59.210 --> 04:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
would be why isn't it enumerated in RSA
 
04:18:02.809 --> 04:18:02.819 align:start position:0%
24 colon 13. so it's
 
04:18:04.189 --> 04:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
I guess there's a couple different ways
 
04:18:05.570 --> 04:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
of trying to
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate the issue
 
04:18:11.229 --> 04:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much I think we've
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much beaten this a dead horse on
 
04:18:17.210 --> 04:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
this point we're going to move on uh
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
just so you know Mr Ferlin we did find
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
your pink card for 43 so you don't have
 
04:18:24.530 --> 04:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
to fill out another one
 
04:18:27.889 --> 04:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
uh like to call our next uh
 
04:18:31.130 --> 04:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
witness Sherry and I cannot make out the
 
04:18:33.010 --> 04:18:33.020 align:start position:0%
last name
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:42.170 --> 04:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
04:18:44.330 --> 04:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
members uh I'm representative Sherry
 
04:18:48.050 --> 04:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
detsee Nashua Ward three uh I also chair
 
04:18:51.889 --> 04:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
the Hillsborough County delegation
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm very new at that so everybody
 
04:18:56.570 --> 04:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
here knows a lot more about County
 
04:18:59.150 --> 04:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
government than I do but the reason I'm
 
04:19:00.889 --> 04:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
here today
 
04:19:03.410 --> 04:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
um is because I was concerned about the
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
wording on hb43 that it does take
 
04:19:09.290 --> 04:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
before we proceed could you state
 
04:19:12.050 --> 04:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
whether you're in favor I'm sorry I'm
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to hb43
 
04:19:17.210 --> 04:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
um because it takes away the power from
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
the county delegation the way we operate
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
in Hillsboro is our County Executive
 
04:19:27.250 --> 04:19:27.260 align:start position:0%
Board meets on a monthly basis
 
04:19:30.410 --> 04:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
so during that time it's it's pretty
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
timely for us to deal with any issues
 
04:19:35.050 --> 04:19:35.060 align:start position:0%
that are coming up
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
secondly at our organizational meeting
 
04:19:42.650 --> 04:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
um we make a number of motions in which
 
04:19:44.929 --> 04:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
the members of the delegation at that
 
04:19:47.330 --> 04:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
point give power to the executive
 
04:19:50.090 --> 04:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
committee so that we can operate on
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
their behalf when it comes time you know
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
for buying or selling or doing anything
 
04:19:59.389 --> 04:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
where it would in the past it might need
 
04:20:02.090 --> 04:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
getting together the delegation in
 
04:20:04.969 --> 04:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County we have 123
 
04:20:09.650 --> 04:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
delegates we have uh 19 on our executive
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
board we never have a problem getting a
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
quorum on our executive board which
 
04:20:17.050 --> 04:20:17.060 align:start position:0%
again meets monthly
 
04:20:20.389 --> 04:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
so for us it would be unwieldy to try to
 
04:20:22.490 --> 04:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
do a County Convention every time we had
 
04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
an issue so that's why these motions are
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
made and the executive board operates on
 
04:20:31.750 --> 04:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of the delegation
 
04:20:37.309 --> 04:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
we do have an operating manual that are
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
attorney for the county gave me and one
 
04:20:44.929 --> 04:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
of the things that it does note under
 
04:20:49.130 --> 04:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
our powers and these are issues that I
 
04:20:50.929 --> 04:20:50.939 align:start position:0%
don't understand the process completely
 
04:20:53.450 --> 04:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
but I unders I guess that various
 
04:20:56.570 --> 04:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
counties can operate under rules that
 
04:20:59.929 --> 04:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
may have been grandfathered in and these
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
rules are being operated under
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County and Hillsborough
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
County but basically under the powers it
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
says that we we have the power to raise
 
04:21:15.889 --> 04:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
County taxes to make Appropriations for
 
04:21:18.650 --> 04:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
the use of the county and to authorize
 
04:21:20.809 --> 04:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
the purchase of real estate for its use
 
04:21:24.050 --> 04:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
the sale and convey conveyance of its
 
04:21:27.050 --> 04:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
real estate the erection enlargement or
 
04:21:28.910 --> 04:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
repair of its buildings exceeding an
 
04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
expensive five thousand dollars and the
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
issuing of bonds for its debt shall be
 
04:21:37.150 --> 04:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
vested in the County Convention okay so
 
04:21:40.250 --> 04:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
any change to this law would take away
 
04:21:42.110 --> 04:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
our powers
 
04:21:44.210 --> 04:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
um we don't see a problem it's been
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
working very very well
 
04:21:48.889 --> 04:21:48.899 align:start position:0%
um so we would be against
 
04:21:51.410 --> 04:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
um making any changes to this thank you
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
04:21:53.040 --> 04:21:55.729 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

04:21:55.729 --> 04:21:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:57.469 --> 04:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
I have no more pink cards on uh HB
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
sporty and what are we on 43 have no
 
04:22:08.450 --> 04:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
more pink cards anybody else
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the hearing on HB 75
 
04:22:30.479 --> 04:22:31.570 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the hearing on HB 75
now

04:22:31.570 --> 04:22:31.580 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
and hello again representative Aarons
 
04:22:35.640 --> 04:22:38.689 align:start position:0%
and hello again representative Aarons
Aaron

04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:22:40.199 --> 04:22:41.210 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
committee

04:22:41.210 --> 04:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
for hearing this bill
 
04:22:47.150 --> 04:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make this very short
 
04:22:47.160 --> 04:22:47.809 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make this very short
um

04:22:47.809 --> 04:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:50.269 --> 04:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
this bill merely increases the threshold
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
of county-owned personal property
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
subject to competitive bidding
 
04:22:57.130 --> 04:22:57.140 align:start position:0%
when RSA 28 colon
 
04:23:01.969 --> 04:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
8-a was adopted it was 1959.
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
based on the inflation calculator the
 
04:23:06.410 --> 04:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
current value of an item worth three
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in 1959
 
04:23:12.290 --> 04:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
is three thousand and fifty four dollars
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
it makes sense therefore to update this
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
statute to reflect the true value of
 
04:23:16.680 --> 04:23:17.630 align:start position:0%
statute to reflect the true value of
property

04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:23:19.729 --> 04:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
uh county-owned personal property
 
04:23:21.530 --> 04:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
because of inflation
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you will vote to pass
 
04:23:32.090 --> 04:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.469 --> 04:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:23:36.410 --> 04:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative are there any
 
04:23:36.420 --> 04:23:40.849 align:start position:0%
representative are there any
questions

04:23:40.849 --> 04:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:45.010 --> 04:23:45.020 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none around the table I have
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
I have a couple one at least one for you
 
04:23:48.359 --> 04:23:49.729 align:start position:0%
I have a couple one at least one for you
sure

04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:23:49.739 --> 04:23:51.110 align:start position:0%
sure
um

04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:53.570 --> 04:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
when it talks about and you may not know
 
04:23:55.130 --> 04:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
the answer to this uh when it talks
 
04:23:57.710 --> 04:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
about the sale of personal property does
 
04:24:00.050 --> 04:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
that is that a single item or can it be
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
a combined
 
04:24:04.610 --> 04:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
number of items uh do you know I don't
 
04:24:04.620 --> 04:24:10.250 align:start position:0%
number of items uh do you know I don't
know

04:24:10.250 --> 04:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:15.370 --> 04:24:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.010 --> 04:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:22.729 --> 04:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
um okay okay so uh I was just looking
 
04:24:26.630 --> 04:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
back at our other bills
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
um to look at House Bill 148
 
04:24:30.840 --> 04:24:31.389 align:start position:0%
um to look at House Bill 148
um

04:24:31.389 --> 04:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:34.969 --> 04:24:34.979 align:start position:0%
which is also about
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh thresholds for competitive build
 
04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
bidding and you know it's the same
 
04:24:46.790 --> 04:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
RSA is 28 8. so um I'm just kind of
 
04:24:49.490 --> 04:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
04:24:51.050 --> 04:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
um you could
 
04:24:55.250 --> 04:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
help lay out the like do do a compare
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
and contrast of like what exactly
 
04:24:59.630 --> 04:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
what why there are two separate bills
 
04:24:59.640 --> 04:25:01.250 align:start position:0%
what why there are two separate bills
here

04:25:01.250 --> 04:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:25:05.929 --> 04:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gallagher um I
 
04:25:10.969 --> 04:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
had no idea
 
04:25:15.050 --> 04:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
about HB 148 being presented so I don't
 
04:25:19.010 --> 04:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
know I hadn't spoken at all to the
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor so I didn't even know
 
04:25:26.090 --> 04:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh Derek Ferrell and
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County Manager testifying in
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
support and uh really have nothing to
 
04:25:55.729 --> 04:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
add in 1959 I think says it all in the
 
04:25:57.170 --> 04:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
inflation calculator I think it speaks
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:07.370 --> 04:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:19.490 --> 04:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
this is for the next one okay that's all
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
we have on that so we will close the
 
04:29:30.910 --> 04:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.250 --> 04:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna go ahead and uh next
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:43.849 --> 04:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
Now for Something Completely Different
 
04:29:48.290 --> 04:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:29:53.929 --> 04:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate everybody's
 
04:29:57.769 --> 04:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
um attention and uh questions on on
 
04:30:01.490 --> 04:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
these uh couple of bills
 
04:30:05.570 --> 04:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
so this is um hb80 and this bill
 
04:30:08.090 --> 04:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
clarifies the exemption of County
 
04:30:10.010 --> 04:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
Administration buildings from Taxation
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
and provides for taxation of
 
04:30:14.030 --> 04:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
county-owned lands and buildings leased
 
04:30:16.070 --> 04:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
by the county to third parties for
 
04:30:18.769 --> 04:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
farming our agricultural use
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
so the reason why this bill came about
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
was I was informed that there have been
 
04:30:27.889 --> 04:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
instances where the assessors have been
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
confused on the issue of what's to be
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
taxed and what's not to be and what's to
 
04:30:33.050 --> 04:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
be exempt
 
04:30:35.929 --> 04:30:35.939 align:start position:0%
so there needs there seems to be a need
 
04:30:38.570 --> 04:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
to clarify this statute and distinguish
 
04:30:40.370 --> 04:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
County Land that's used for farming and
 
04:30:42.670 --> 04:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
agricultural use versus
 
04:30:45.050 --> 04:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
County Land that's used for public
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
access and use
 
04:30:51.290 --> 04:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
um and again this was something that was
 
04:30:53.450 --> 04:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
presented to me by Sullivan County
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
Manager Derek ferland I'm sure that he
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
can give you more background on this
 
04:30:58.800 --> 04:31:00.250 align:start position:0%
can give you more background on this
particular

04:31:00.250 --> 04:31:00.260 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:31:04.370 --> 04:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
issue and that's all I have to say in
 
04:31:09.469 --> 04:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
I think a rep 7 Aaron uh representative
 
04:31:12.000 --> 04:31:13.370 align:start position:0%
I think a rep 7 Aaron uh representative
power

04:31:13.370 --> 04:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
power
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:31:17.210 --> 04:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
taking my question if I'm not mistaken
 
04:31:19.969 --> 04:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
when I read the
 
04:31:22.630 --> 04:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
um the build text here
 
04:31:26.990 --> 04:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
the the first sentence is an incomplete
 
04:31:27.000 --> 04:31:28.670 align:start position:0%
the the first sentence is an incomplete
sentence

04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
04:31:31.490 --> 04:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
like I'm not seeing a verb
 
04:31:33.769 --> 04:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
because there's a period after the word
 
04:31:33.779 --> 04:31:35.330 align:start position:0%
because there's a period after the word
buildings

04:31:35.330 --> 04:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
04:31:41.689 --> 04:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
I think I'd have to take a look at let
 
04:31:52.070 --> 04:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:52.080 --> 04:31:53.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:31:53.630 --> 04:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
you're right yeah
 
04:32:00.649 --> 04:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
of the RSA probably says
 
04:32:05.830 --> 04:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
such and such and such
 
04:32:11.469 --> 04:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:14.929 --> 04:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
which is in the RSA right but if there's
 
04:32:17.769 --> 04:32:17.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:17.779 --> 04:32:21.189 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:21.199 --> 04:32:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
correct

04:32:23.110 --> 04:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:32:25.070 --> 04:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
and they didn't
 
04:32:25.080 --> 04:32:29.469 align:start position:0%
and they didn't
right

04:32:29.469 --> 04:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
can I follow up uh follow uh yeah I'm
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
not sure here could I comment I believe
 
04:32:37.610 --> 04:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh representative Powers is correct if
 
04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up question yes go
 
04:32:39.000 --> 04:32:46.070 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up question yes go
ahead

04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
um representative Hicks that was thank
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for the taking my
 
04:32:53.090 --> 04:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
question that was my question as well
 
04:32:55.969 --> 04:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
and did you mean or to read shall not be
 
04:32:55.979 --> 04:32:58.250 align:start position:0%
and did you mean or to read shall not be
taxed

04:32:58.250 --> 04:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
taxed
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
I think it should be Shelby text shall
 
04:33:03.649 --> 04:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
be taxed at the end I guess that must
 
04:33:05.390 --> 04:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
have been something I overlooked from
 
04:33:10.250 --> 04:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.650 --> 04:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
I think that's correct I think those
 
04:33:14.330 --> 04:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
three words should be in there so that
 
04:33:17.449 --> 04:33:17.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.510 --> 04:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment representative Aaron
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:33:25.490 --> 04:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative uh represents Davis thank
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:33:27.119 --> 04:33:28.551 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
so

04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
you're not sure what the intent of this
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
amendment is no I am still be taxed or
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
shall lost okay so the way this reads
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
lands and buildings and personal
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
property owned and used by any County
 
04:33:44.929 --> 04:33:44.939 align:start position:0%
for governmental purposes including
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals courthouses registry buildings
 
04:33:50.269 --> 04:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
and County correctional facilities and
 
04:33:52.609 --> 04:33:52.619 align:start position:0%
County Administration buildings shall be
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
taxed so they left out OLS apparently
 
04:33:58.369 --> 04:33:58.379 align:start position:0%
left out the Shelby tax part and I
 
04:34:01.490 --> 04:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
didn't touch that when I saw that
 
04:34:03.650 --> 04:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
so I think it requires a little bit more
 
04:34:08.529 --> 04:34:08.539 align:start position:0%
work than that because of the Clause
 
04:34:11.090 --> 04:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
except the County farms and their lands
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
buildings and taxable personal property
 
04:34:14.929 --> 04:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
shall be taxed
 
04:34:18.830 --> 04:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
and so that is a a clause within the
 
04:34:21.170 --> 04:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
sentence so there's something definitely
 
04:34:23.449 --> 04:34:23.459 align:start position:0%
wrong with the with the with the
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
drafting here yeah well the way they did
 
04:34:28.609 --> 04:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
it they struck out the entire thing from
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
except to the word taxed when they
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
should have struck out what I'm asking
 
04:34:35.330 --> 04:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
is what is the intent of the bill that
 
04:34:38.631 --> 04:34:38.641 align:start position:0%
they be taxed or they not be taxed
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
that those items shall be taxed and the
 
04:34:43.730 --> 04:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
ones that are mentioned
 
04:34:43.740 --> 04:34:47.330 align:start position:0%
ones that are mentioned
um

04:34:47.330 --> 04:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.490 --> 04:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
the ones that are the the ones that
 
04:34:51.890 --> 04:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
shall not be that are accepted from that
 
04:34:55.849 --> 04:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
are the the in my bill land in buildings
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
for farming or agricultural use operated
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
by the county and land in buildings for
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
farming or agricultural use leased by
 
04:35:06.051 --> 04:35:06.061 align:start position:0%
the county shall be taxed
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna suggest is it a question you
 
04:35:11.510 --> 04:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
can hold for
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
why don't we do that
 
04:35:19.439 --> 04:35:21.949 align:start position:0%
why don't we do that
um

04:35:21.949 --> 04:35:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
if nobody else has any particular
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Aaron last
 
04:35:26.750 --> 04:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh next
 
04:35:28.970 --> 04:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
pink card holder Mr furland come up and
 
04:35:28.980 --> 04:35:29.929 align:start position:0%
pink card holder Mr furland come up and
maybe

04:35:29.929 --> 04:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:35:33.650 --> 04:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
he has a more definitive
 
04:35:45.230 --> 04:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
04:35:49.369 --> 04:35:49.379 align:start position:0%
committee uh Derek Ferrell and Sullivan
 
04:35:51.650 --> 04:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
County Manager of testifying in support
 
04:35:52.970 --> 04:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
04:35:55.010 --> 04:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
um so the I apologize for the oversight
 
04:35:56.929 --> 04:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
I I was also asked to review the the
 
04:35:58.369 --> 04:35:58.379 align:start position:0%
product when it came out from OLS and I
 
04:35:59.810 --> 04:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
missed it as well
 
04:36:01.609 --> 04:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
um the intent was that the first
 
04:36:04.369 --> 04:36:04.379 align:start position:0%
sentence was shall not be taxed it's to
 
04:36:06.289 --> 04:36:06.299 align:start position:0%
distinguish the county administrative
 
04:36:08.990 --> 04:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
buildings and functions and distinguish
 
04:36:11.570 --> 04:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
them from the remnants of the County
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
Farms either for the counties that still
 
04:36:13.320 --> 04:36:14.330 align:start position:0%
Farms either for the counties that still
have

04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:36:16.490 --> 04:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
um land that's leased to third parties
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
or operate a farm internally
 
04:36:22.369 --> 04:36:22.379 align:start position:0%
so the way this came about as as
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron said it was um an
 
04:36:25.250 --> 04:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
interaction that we had with the
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
assessors there's contract Assessors for
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
the town of unity and so we just had a
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
lot of back and forth about Again The
 
04:36:32.810 --> 04:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
evolutionary nature of County government
 
04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
at least in Sullivan County we have uh
 
04:36:38.449 --> 04:36:38.459 align:start position:0%
buildings on our campus in unity that
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
used to be part of the County Farm uh
 
04:36:42.830 --> 04:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
the hay barn and we have another an old
 
04:36:45.349 --> 04:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
heifer Barn as well as some other sheds
 
04:36:47.330 --> 04:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
that were Once Upon a Time fully
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
involved and used solely for the County
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
Farm function and they are now used for
 
04:36:55.250 --> 04:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
County storage in fact our hay barn is
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
used to park the uh the activities bus
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
for our nursing home as well as a couple
 
04:37:02.631 --> 04:37:02.641 align:start position:0%
of Emergency Response trailers for the
 
04:37:04.490 --> 04:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
State Police our Sheriff's Office and
 
04:37:06.170 --> 04:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
the public health network
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
so those tax cards still have
 
04:37:11.390 --> 04:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
contradictory information because the
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
title will say hay barn County Farm and
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
the assessors wanted to tax us under the
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
provision of the of RSA 72 where it says
 
04:37:21.890 --> 04:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
County Farms will be taxed and we said
 
04:37:23.330 --> 04:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
well it's not part of the farm anymore
 
04:37:26.570 --> 04:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
it's part of the uh County Complex and
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
is used for governmental purposes and
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
therefore should not be taxed so that
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
was really the the series of exchanges
 
04:37:33.949 --> 04:37:33.959 align:start position:0%
that we've had over the last couple of
 
04:37:35.929 --> 04:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
years with the the assessing Department
 
04:37:38.449 --> 04:37:38.459 align:start position:0%
uh the contract assessor and so we just
 
04:37:40.010 --> 04:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to again add some clarity to
 
04:37:44.449 --> 04:37:44.459 align:start position:0%
distinguish those uh buildings that are
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
purely for the purposes of the County
 
04:37:47.869 --> 04:37:47.879 align:start position:0%
government as opposed to those that
 
04:37:50.631 --> 04:37:50.641 align:start position:0%
still support a farming operation and we
 
04:37:53.570 --> 04:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
do have land leases and so those not
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
only the land but the outbuildings that
 
04:37:58.250 --> 04:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
support and are included in those leases
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
we fully agree should be taxed and our
 
04:38:03.410 --> 04:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
leases actually reflect that so we
 
04:38:04.970 --> 04:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
collect enough revenue on those leases
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
to pay the tax bills so we have no
 
04:38:08.570 --> 04:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
quarrel with the fact that County
 
04:38:10.369 --> 04:38:10.379 align:start position:0%
farming operations are a separate
 
04:38:12.890 --> 04:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
taxable activity uh we're just trying to
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
again clear up
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
any confusion over what's a purely
 
04:38:18.890 --> 04:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
governmental purpose versus an
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
agricultural purpose in the context of
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.680 --> 04:38:27.709 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you Mr
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
question so if I understand your
 
04:38:36.051 --> 04:38:36.061 align:start position:0%
situation you have buildings which were
 
04:38:38.510 --> 04:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
were once and are now not
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
but isn't that something that can be is
 
04:38:43.131 --> 04:38:43.141 align:start position:0%
that something that can be clarified by
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
your assessor to reassign what the
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
building is and therefore is is this
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
bill specific to you are you looking
 
04:38:52.730 --> 04:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
more in the in the Universal sense of of
 
04:38:55.510 --> 04:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying something or both
 
04:38:57.650 --> 04:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question
 
04:39:00.051 --> 04:39:00.061 align:start position:0%
um representative I I think the answer
 
04:39:01.730 --> 04:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
is a little bit of both I mean we I
 
04:39:03.170 --> 04:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
could show you uh volumes of email
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
traffic back and forth trying to
 
04:39:07.490 --> 04:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
persuade uh the contract assessing
 
04:39:09.709 --> 04:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
company that our interpretation of the
 
04:39:12.170 --> 04:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
RSA was was in fact correct and we
 
04:39:13.730 --> 04:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
disagreed with their interpretation and
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
I guess the resolution is either you go
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
to court or you try to get the the law
 
04:39:20.570 --> 04:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
Rewritten and clarified and this is the
 
04:39:22.369 --> 04:39:22.379 align:start position:0%
route that we chose I just I'm not sure
 
04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
what else there is to do when you have
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
two parties that are reading the same
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
statutes and they just simply disagree
 
04:39:30.349 --> 04:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
on what they say so this was the this
 
04:39:33.709 --> 04:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.719 --> 04:39:41.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
hiding over here in the corner thanks
 
04:39:45.288 --> 04:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
for spending the day with us it's great
 
04:39:48.890 --> 04:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
to have you would you agree or would you
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
think that this is similar to a
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
situation where a church owns a parking
 
04:39:56.510 --> 04:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
lot and the church is not taxed because
 
04:39:59.630 --> 04:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
they're a church a religious community
 
04:39:59.640 --> 04:40:00.770 align:start position:0%
they're a church a religious community
um

04:40:00.770 --> 04:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
they decide that they can lease their
 
04:40:05.810 --> 04:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
parking lot to the nightclub next door
 
04:40:07.970 --> 04:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
different uses different times all the
 
04:40:09.410 --> 04:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
above and all of a sudden the church
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
gets a tax bill for the parking lot even
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
though they still own it
 
04:40:15.050 --> 04:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
but they've used it for a commercial
 
04:40:18.410 --> 04:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
purpose not a religious purpose so it's
 
04:40:21.530 --> 04:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
um liable for that tax
 
04:40:25.368 --> 04:40:25.378 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you same idea
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:40:30.890 --> 04:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
um before I answer I'd probably reinsert
 
04:40:32.330 --> 04:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
the caveat that I am neither an attorney
 
04:40:36.650 --> 04:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
nor a historian but what I would say uh
 
04:40:38.510 --> 04:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
yes I agree philosophically that's I
 
04:40:39.890 --> 04:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
don't think this case is that much
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
different than than what you just
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.650 --> 04:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no others I do have oh sorry
 
04:40:56.330 --> 04:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
04:40:57.890 --> 04:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:40:59.810 --> 04:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh we had a lot of
 
04:41:01.730 --> 04:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
conversation about grammar and I just
 
04:41:04.010 --> 04:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
want to be clear about where we are in
 
04:41:04.020 --> 04:41:05.510 align:start position:0%
want to be clear about where we are in
it

04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:41:08.090 --> 04:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
um because
 
04:41:10.970 --> 04:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
yeah no because the last sentence says
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
the land and buildings for farm and
 
04:41:15.530 --> 04:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
agricultural use operated by the county
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
shall be taxed and is your goal to keep
 
04:41:20.930 --> 04:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
it as shall not be taxed
 
04:41:24.530 --> 04:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
no okay no the shall not be taxed should
 
04:41:26.330 --> 04:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
be inserted at the end of the first
 
04:41:26.340 --> 04:41:31.010 align:start position:0%
be inserted at the end of the first
sentence

04:41:31.010 --> 04:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
so it would say
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
um lands and buildings and personal
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
property owned and used by any County
 
04:41:37.970 --> 04:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
for governmental purposes including
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals courthouses registry buildings
 
04:41:42.770 --> 04:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
County correctional facilities and
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
County Administration buildings shall
 
04:41:46.128 --> 04:41:46.138 align:start position:0%
not be taxed
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of it the land and
 
04:41:51.470 --> 04:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
buildings for farming shall be taxed in
 
04:41:54.770 --> 04:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
accordance with RSA 72 colon 23 Section
 
04:41:59.570 --> 04:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:09.590 --> 04:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative you Keller
 
04:42:11.628 --> 04:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
04:42:11.638 --> 04:42:13.550 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
question

04:42:13.550 --> 04:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:42:18.170 --> 04:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
um this section of law is is all part of
 
04:42:18.180 --> 04:42:20.330 align:start position:0%
um this section of law is is all part of
of

04:42:20.330 --> 04:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:42:23.090 --> 04:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh the section that starts reading the
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
following real estate and personal items
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
shall be uh shall uh unless otherwise
 
04:42:31.610 --> 04:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
provided by actually be exempt and so
 
04:42:33.890 --> 04:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
this is just part of that list of the
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
things that are exempt
 
04:42:40.730 --> 04:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
um so I I do
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
um I think I get what you're trying to
 
04:42:46.490 --> 04:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
say but my question is in these last two
 
04:42:46.500 --> 04:42:48.590 align:start position:0%
say but my question is in these last two
sentences

04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
04:42:50.330 --> 04:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
um do you believe that they need to be
 
04:42:53.090 --> 04:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
two separate sentences since the
 
04:42:55.010 --> 04:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
since it's both land and buildings for
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
farming or out agricultural
 
04:42:57.958 --> 04:42:59.150 align:start position:0%
farming or out agricultural
um

04:42:59.150 --> 04:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:02.570 --> 04:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
use do you believe that there's any
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
reason why those two sentences can not
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
be combined into the dude
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
to who is running them
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
I guess it says Landing buildings for
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
farming and agricultural use operated by
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
and then it says Landing using farming
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
agricultural use lease by so is there
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
any reason why you can see that those
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be combined into one
 
04:43:24.718 --> 04:43:26.628 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be combined into one
sentence

04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
04:43:28.250 --> 04:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think so
 
04:43:30.288 --> 04:43:30.298 align:start position:0%
um I think that would be
 
04:43:32.090 --> 04:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
an appropriate
 
04:43:34.430 --> 04:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
change uh if it's if your goal is just
 
04:43:35.930 --> 04:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
to simplify it and have fewer sentences
 
04:43:37.850 --> 04:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
I don't see any problem with that okay
 
04:43:39.730 --> 04:43:39.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
04:43:44.810 --> 04:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I apologize for
 
04:43:44.820 --> 04:43:45.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I apologize for
not

04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
um being up to speed on effective dates
 
04:43:51.650 --> 04:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
I do recall having researched that a
 
04:43:53.090 --> 04:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
couple years ago
 
04:43:56.208 --> 04:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
and um so specifically could you please
 
04:43:59.628 --> 04:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
explain why that this act shall take
 
04:44:02.510 --> 04:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
effect of April 1st 2024 which the
 
04:44:06.770 --> 04:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:08.330 --> 04:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question versus
 
04:44:10.190 --> 04:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
inner power I I can't answer that I
 
04:44:11.690 --> 04:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
don't know I was only focused on the
 
04:44:11.700 --> 04:44:12.948 align:start position:0%
don't know I was only focused on the
verbiage

04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
verbiage
 
04:44:14.448 --> 04:44:14.458 align:start position:0%
um the effective date
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:28.128 --> 04:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will thank you for your
 
04:44:29.868 --> 04:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
testimony again and we will close the
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:56.110 --> 04:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
okay it is 2 45
 
04:45:00.850 --> 04:45:00.860 align:start position:0%
so we will continue on our list HB 83
 
04:45:03.410 --> 04:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
relative to County Commissioners
 
04:45:05.770 --> 04:45:05.780 align:start position:0%
Authority on County
 
04:45:09.770 --> 04:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
buildings representative air
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and just before I
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
say something about that on this past
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill that we went through I'm going to
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
be submitting an amendment to fix that I
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
would say that would be a very good idea
 
04:45:24.288 --> 04:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:28.730 --> 04:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:28.740 --> 04:45:30.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:45:30.170 --> 04:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:45:30.180 --> 04:45:31.070 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:33.890 --> 04:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
so this is HB 83
 
04:45:33.900 --> 04:45:35.810 align:start position:0%
so this is HB 83
um

04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:40.250 --> 04:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
and what this one does is it removes
 
04:45:42.170 --> 04:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
references to expense thresholds for
 
04:45:44.270 --> 04:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners authority to
 
04:45:46.250 --> 04:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
purchase real estate and repair enlarge
 
04:45:48.288 --> 04:45:48.298 align:start position:0%
or erect County buildings
 
04:45:50.270 --> 04:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
in the first two sections of this bill
 
04:45:55.330 --> 04:45:55.340 align:start position:0%
RSA 28 colon 5 and RSA 28 colon 7
 
04:45:57.530 --> 04:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
authorization from the County Convention
 
04:46:00.050 --> 04:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
is required and this dollar threshold is
 
04:46:02.030 --> 04:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
already articulated
 
04:46:04.850 --> 04:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
in RSA 2413
 
04:46:08.510 --> 04:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
so duplicating the threshold in RSA 28
 
04:46:13.930 --> 04:46:13.940 align:start position:0%
colon 5 and RSA colon 20 28 colon 7.
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
merely introduces the probability for
 
04:46:20.810 --> 04:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
error if either of these or RSA 24 colon
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
13 is ever updated
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm recommending this change so that
 
04:46:26.750 --> 04:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount can be referenced in
 
04:46:29.330 --> 04:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:34.490 --> 04:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
the repeal of RSA 30-b colon 2 is
 
04:46:34.500 --> 04:46:35.628 align:start position:0%
the repeal of RSA 30-b colon 2 is
requested

04:46:35.628 --> 04:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
requested
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
because this RSA is entirely redundant
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
with RSA 28 colon 7 and RSA 20 72 colon
 
04:46:44.520 --> 04:46:46.128 align:start position:0%
with RSA 28 colon 7 and RSA 20 72 colon
23.

04:46:46.128 --> 04:46:46.138 align:start position:0%
23.
 
04:46:50.090 --> 04:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
so that's the Crux of this particular
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
04:46:58.010 --> 04:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to comment and also uh
 
04:47:00.170 --> 04:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County Manager Derek Ferlin can
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
your testimony is complete I assume so
 
04:47:17.090 --> 04:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh questions
 
04:47:17.100 --> 04:47:19.490 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh questions
representative

04:47:19.490 --> 04:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:47:21.170 --> 04:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:47:25.128 --> 04:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
another question I'm looking at HB 83
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
that you just introduced which
 
04:47:31.310 --> 04:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
requires that it be authorized by the
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
County Convention
 
04:47:36.288 --> 04:47:36.298 align:start position:0%
and then I'm looking back at HP 43 which
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
was previously introduced which removed
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
the authority of the County Convention
 
04:47:45.170 --> 04:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:49.070 --> 04:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
make that make sense for me why it
 
04:47:51.230 --> 04:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
should require the County Convention in
 
04:47:52.610 --> 04:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
one and not the other
 
04:47:55.250 --> 04:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
well I guess we had discussed about the
 
04:47:56.570 --> 04:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
real real estate and real property
 
04:48:12.890 --> 04:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:15.770 --> 04:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
oh representative manager Puti thank you
 
04:48:17.930 --> 04:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative for
 
04:48:20.330 --> 04:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:48:20.340 --> 04:48:22.610 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:48:22.610 --> 04:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
I want to put it in a succinct way it's
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
in my mind this is creating more
 
04:48:32.930 --> 04:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
confusion in terms of rsa's the
 
04:48:35.570 --> 04:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
evolution and what it is instead of
 
04:48:39.170 --> 04:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
clarifying can you help me
 
04:48:39.180 --> 04:48:40.990 align:start position:0%
clarifying can you help me
understand

04:48:40.990 --> 04:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:48:45.770 --> 04:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
how this is clarifying versus creating
 
04:48:49.190 --> 04:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:00.650 --> 04:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
which I've misplaced
 
04:49:03.050 --> 04:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
um the dollar threshold for doing these
 
04:49:08.050 --> 04:49:08.060 align:start position:0%
kinds of transactions is already stated
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
so it's almost a duplication for it to
 
04:49:12.000 --> 04:49:12.770 align:start position:0%
so it's almost a duplication for it to
be

04:49:12.770 --> 04:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:49:12.780 --> 04:49:14.208 align:start position:0%
be
uh

04:49:14.208 --> 04:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:21.000 --> 04:49:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
why

04:49:35.150 --> 04:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:37.970 --> 04:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:39.650 --> 04:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm also
 
04:49:43.310 --> 04:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
thoroughly confused
 
04:49:46.970 --> 04:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
by the drafting of this particular bill
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
so on section three where it says repeal
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify the way that that
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
wording is
 
04:49:57.830 --> 04:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
it states relative to County Corrections
 
04:50:00.410 --> 04:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
real estate in buildings is comma is
 
04:50:00.420 --> 04:50:02.510 align:start position:0%
real estate in buildings is comma is
repealed

04:50:02.510 --> 04:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
04:50:04.490 --> 04:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's is that some type of an
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
explanation or title
 
04:50:12.288 --> 04:50:12.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
so I understand that you want to repeal
 
04:50:20.208 --> 04:50:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:24.650 --> 04:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
I'm just confused by that language yeah
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:35.930 --> 04:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
okay RSA 30
 
04:50:43.368 --> 04:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.378 --> 04:50:47.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:50:47.170 --> 04:50:47.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:58.850 --> 04:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:01.368 --> 04:51:01.378 align:start position:0%
it says when so authorized by the County
 
04:51:03.170 --> 04:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
Convention they may purchase real estate
 
04:51:04.850 --> 04:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
as may be required for County
 
04:51:07.490 --> 04:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities including County
 
04:51:10.610 --> 04:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
Farms or other uses they may repair a
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
large or erect County buildings at a
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
cost exceeding five thousand dollars
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
and with like Authority they may sell
 
04:51:19.730 --> 04:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
any of the County's real estate so
 
04:51:19.740 --> 04:51:24.050 align:start position:0%
any of the County's real estate so
a

04:51:24.050 --> 04:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.160 --> 04:51:40.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:51:40.250 --> 04:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:45.410 --> 04:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
if RSA 30-b colon 2 is repealed my
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
question is Will County correctional
 
04:51:50.330 --> 04:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
facilities then shall they be exempt
 
04:51:54.770 --> 04:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.650 --> 04:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
what that's a good question I would like
 
04:52:00.530 --> 04:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
to defer that to our uh our Sullivan
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
County Manager
 
04:52:06.288 --> 04:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
no they're repealing this
 
04:52:09.050 --> 04:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
so they were repealing this
 
04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know by repealing it
 
04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
can I can I just make a statement
 
04:52:17.208 --> 04:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
um we will continue with questions first
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
representative anybody else
 
04:52:20.638 --> 04:52:24.350 align:start position:0%
representative anybody else
um

04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
04:52:29.570 --> 04:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'll bring
 
04:52:31.250 --> 04:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
that a little bit closer
 
04:52:31.260 --> 04:52:32.090 align:start position:0%
that a little bit closer
um

04:52:32.090 --> 04:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:35.030 --> 04:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to 28.5 and the five
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars yep I I understand I
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
understand your explanation has there
 
04:52:45.288 --> 04:52:45.298 align:start position:0%
been a stated problem or confusion
 
04:52:45.298 --> 04:52:46.910 align:start position:0%
been a stated problem or confusion
between

04:52:46.910 --> 04:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:52:52.010 --> 04:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
24 13 and 28 5 where this will fix those
 
04:52:56.090 --> 04:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
historical problems or is this more of a
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
housekeeping I think it's more of a
 
04:53:05.390 --> 04:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
your mic's on I didn't know if you
 
04:53:09.470 --> 04:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to okay
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay further questions thank you
 
04:53:30.110 --> 04:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:33.288 --> 04:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
Mr Berlin welcome back uh thank you Mr
 
04:53:34.910 --> 04:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee uh Derek
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
Ferrell in Sullivan County uh manager
 
04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
and testifying in support of this bill
 
04:53:39.958 --> 04:53:40.788 align:start position:0%
and testifying in support of this bill
um

04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:43.610 --> 04:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
just add a bit of context the this bill
 
04:53:46.368 --> 04:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
emanated from uh my research on the next
 
04:53:48.530 --> 04:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
bill which was starting out looking at
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
the threshold and updating that but when
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
I was doing the cross-referencing it
 
04:53:54.410 --> 04:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
just occurred to me that we have a
 
04:53:55.970 --> 04:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
dollar threshold referenced in three
 
04:53:55.980 --> 04:53:57.530 align:start position:0%
dollar threshold referenced in three
separate

04:53:57.530 --> 04:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
um rsas and it just introduces the
 
04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for error if you ever do
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
change the threshold you might not
 
04:54:06.110 --> 04:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
intuitively understand that it's it
 
04:54:09.230 --> 04:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
appears in others so the the references
 
04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the county commissioner chapter of
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
chapter 28 so RSA is I think it's 28 is
 
04:54:17.448 --> 04:54:17.458 align:start position:0%
it 28 5 and 28 7.
 
04:54:21.770 --> 04:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
yes 25 and 28 7. really the specifying
 
04:54:24.410 --> 04:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
the dollar value is is to me is is uh is
 
04:54:24.420 --> 04:54:25.850 align:start position:0%
the dollar value is is to me is is uh is
redundant

04:54:25.850 --> 04:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
04:54:28.610 --> 04:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
um the when the budget is approved any
 
04:54:30.770 --> 04:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
repair projects or capital projects are
 
04:54:32.030 --> 04:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
generally either depending on how the
 
04:54:34.250 --> 04:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
county does it identified by line item
 
04:54:36.650 --> 04:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
or enumerated in the context of a
 
04:54:39.170 --> 04:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repair budget so
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
um I just felt that there wasn't any
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
additional value added by specifying the
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
dollar value because if you change RSA
 
04:54:48.288 --> 04:54:48.298 align:start position:0%
24 colon 13
 
04:54:50.090 --> 04:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
um that's where the you know the
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
delegation's oversight and approval of
 
04:54:53.628 --> 04:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
those projects now one of the
 
04:54:56.270 --> 04:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
justifications for increasing that
 
04:54:57.530 --> 04:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
threshold which I guess I'll get to in
 
04:54:59.208 --> 04:54:59.218 align:start position:0%
the next hearing so I I guess I'll table
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
that remark
 
04:55:01.200 --> 04:55:02.150 align:start position:0%
that remark
um

04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:04.128 --> 04:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
but I guess it does come up because it's
 
04:55:06.530 --> 04:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
in response to the previous question
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
um there are instances when we are
 
04:55:10.970 --> 04:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
making repairs that do exceed five
 
04:55:12.890 --> 04:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh we had a heat
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
exchanger in the nursing home about a
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago that failed and I
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
believe it was like a thirteen thousand
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
dollar repair given the emergency nature
 
04:55:25.430 --> 04:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
of of that particular issue we certainly
 
04:55:27.230 --> 04:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to go back and get the
 
04:55:28.850 --> 04:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
the county delegation to convene a
 
04:55:31.550 --> 04:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and and approve it so
 
04:55:33.708 --> 04:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
um but they did approve and appropriate
 
04:55:35.810 --> 04:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
a maintenance and repair budget and
 
04:55:37.610 --> 04:55:37.620 align:start position:0%
that's where we drew the funding from so
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
I guess in that particular instance the
 
04:55:40.970 --> 04:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
threshold did matter and it was in
 
04:55:43.550 --> 04:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
response to a particular situation but
 
04:55:45.470 --> 04:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
really this did stem from
 
04:55:49.010 --> 04:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
um the desire to update House Bill 87
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
which is in line with previous bills
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
which is just a matter of keeping up
 
04:55:58.570 --> 04:55:58.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:01.970 --> 04:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
oh and I guess I also say Mr chair
 
04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
um in response to any confusion about
 
04:56:07.010 --> 04:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill House Bill 43 uh this
 
04:56:08.510 --> 04:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
is specifically
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
in relation to building or enlarging or
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
repairing as opposed to the disposal and
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
so I do think there is a clear
 
04:56:19.730 --> 04:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
distinction as to what this bill is
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
trying to fix and I don't think it
 
04:56:23.090 --> 04:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
without getting into the whole real
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
estate versus Real Property discussion
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I do think 288c is clearly on the
 
04:56:29.570 --> 04:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
disposition end of it and this is on the
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
enlarging or erecting which I do think
 
04:56:33.890 --> 04:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
if you're going to build a building that
 
04:56:35.448 --> 04:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
absolutely the delegation should know
 
04:56:37.550 --> 04:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
about it which is why
 
04:56:39.890 --> 04:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
um you know I again have no issue with
 
04:56:42.530 --> 04:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
the oversight on that end of it but once
 
04:56:43.970 --> 04:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
it's built I guess the broader legal
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
question is who then has the authority
 
04:56:48.530 --> 04:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
to uh to dispose of it knowing that
 
04:56:49.670 --> 04:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're not going to sell a building
 
04:56:51.050 --> 04:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
without also addressing the land under
 
04:56:52.368 --> 04:56:52.378 align:start position:0%
it but
 
04:56:54.410 --> 04:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
um and then 25
 
04:56:56.868 --> 04:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
000 as opposed to 5 000 is this you know
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
we we put up a a shed in our community
 
04:57:01.850 --> 04:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
garden this past year and that cost
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
eight thousand and um
 
04:57:06.410 --> 04:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
at the risk of in um incriminating
 
04:57:08.030 --> 04:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
myself I will tell you we absolutely
 
04:57:10.270 --> 04:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
just did that without the delegations
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
explicit approval other than the funds
 
04:57:15.770 --> 04:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
that were appropriated in the budget so
 
04:57:17.810 --> 04:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
you know you could say that we had the
 
04:57:19.070 --> 04:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
approval because they did approve the
 
04:57:20.270 --> 04:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
budget but it wasn't like we're going to
 
04:57:21.650 --> 04:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
go to them with a line item approval for
 
04:57:26.448 --> 04:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:27.470 --> 04:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll wait for the
 
04:57:34.010 --> 04:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay oh and Mr chair I sorry there to
 
04:57:38.750 --> 04:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
clear up any other confusion thank you
 
04:57:39.948 --> 04:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
Kate for
 
04:57:43.250 --> 04:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
um the question on RSA 30 Dash B colon
 
04:57:46.190 --> 04:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
2. um I'll just read it verbatim so it's
 
04:57:48.050 --> 04:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
under the Department of Corrections
 
04:57:51.650 --> 04:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
statute and it says 30-b colon 2 real
 
04:57:54.770 --> 04:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
estate semicolon buildings in accordance
 
04:57:57.170 --> 04:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
with RSA 287 when authorized by the
 
04:57:58.610 --> 04:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
County Convention the County
 
04:58:00.110 --> 04:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners May purchase such real
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
estate as may be required for a County
 
04:58:03.890 --> 04:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
correctional facility and may repair
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
enlarge or erect County buildings
 
04:58:08.330 --> 04:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
housing County correctional facilities
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
and may sell any of the County's real
 
04:58:10.920 --> 04:58:11.930 align:start position:0%
and may sell any of the County's real
estate

04:58:11.930 --> 04:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
estate
 
04:58:15.170 --> 04:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
as provided in RSA 72 colon 3 section 2
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
County correctional facilities shall be
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
exempt from taxation except that County
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
farms and their lands buildings and
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
taxable personal property shall be taxed
 
04:58:28.368 --> 04:58:28.378 align:start position:0%
so everything in that chapter is covered
 
04:58:31.250 --> 04:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
almost word for word in either rsas 28 7
 
04:58:34.208 --> 04:58:34.218 align:start position:0%
or 7223 I mean it is completely
 
04:58:36.650 --> 04:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
redundant serves no purpose and has no
 
04:58:38.570 --> 04:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
value hence the the recommendation to
 
04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
simply delete it in the interest of of
 
04:58:43.610 --> 04:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:45.948 --> 04:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you
 
04:58:45.958 --> 04:58:49.430 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you
questions

04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:53.330 --> 04:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
that was the last pink card
 
04:58:59.270 --> 04:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to submit a pink card
 
04:59:02.570 --> 04:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
before we close the hearing
 
04:59:04.430 --> 04:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none we closed the hearing
 
04:59:18.410 --> 04:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:18.420 --> 04:59:22.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay it is three o'clock we'll open up
 
04:59:27.830 --> 04:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing on our last bill of the day
 
04:59:34.490 --> 04:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:36.530 --> 04:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
committee for all your patience and
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
questions on all of these bills
 
04:59:41.400 --> 04:59:41.990 align:start position:0%
questions on all of these bills
um

04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is hb30 HB 87
 
04:59:48.530 --> 04:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
and this bill raises the monetary cap on
 
04:59:50.690 --> 04:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
the value of enlargements or repairs to
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
County buildings vested in the County
 
04:59:52.320 --> 04:59:53.448 align:start position:0%
County buildings vested in the County
Convention

04:59:53.448 --> 04:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
Convention
 
04:59:57.170 --> 04:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
currently RSA 24 colon 13 uses five
 
04:59:59.570 --> 04:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars as a benchmark for
 
05:00:02.448 --> 05:00:02.458 align:start position:0%
Capitol building project thresholds in
 
05:00:04.128 --> 05:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
today's times and especially with
 
05:00:06.530 --> 05:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
inflation twenty five thousand dollars
 
05:00:08.270 --> 05:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
is a widely used threshold to
 
05:00:10.490 --> 05:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
distinguish capital projects and repairs
 
05:00:13.128 --> 05:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
from non-capital projects and repairs
 
05:00:15.650 --> 05:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
capital projects are normally singled
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
out for approval in a county budgeting
 
05:00:20.090 --> 05:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
process so the delegation oversight and
 
05:00:21.770 --> 05:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
approval of these projects would be
 
05:00:23.510 --> 05:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
accomplished during each budget cycle
 
05:00:23.520 --> 05:00:24.770 align:start position:0%
accomplished during each budget cycle
anyway

05:00:24.770 --> 05:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:00:27.170 --> 05:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
I think that our rsas need to reflect
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
the reality of the cost of capital
 
05:00:31.250 --> 05:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
building projects
 
05:00:33.890 --> 05:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars is not realistic
 
05:00:37.610 --> 05:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
anymore doing so would not uh
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
so doing so would not only make our
 
05:00:41.750 --> 05:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
current rsas realistic but also save
 
05:00:44.030 --> 05:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
time requiring delegation oversight and
 
05:00:46.190 --> 05:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
approval for projects that really should
 
05:00:49.368 --> 05:00:49.378 align:start position:0%
not require that time
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill is all about
 
05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:02.810 --> 05:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative status
 
05:01:05.090 --> 05:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you once
 
05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
again representative Aaron
 
05:01:09.890 --> 05:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
um my question about this particular
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill goes to the delegation's authority
 
05:01:13.440 --> 05:01:14.810 align:start position:0%
bill goes to the delegation's authority
to

05:01:14.810 --> 05:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:16.430 --> 05:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
tax tax
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
citizens to Levy County taxes and in
 
05:01:22.670 --> 05:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
part that Authority is based on the
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
expenses that the county must incur on
 
05:01:27.530 --> 05:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
behalf of its citizens
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
so I I'm wondering
 
05:01:34.910 --> 05:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why you think that 25 000
 
05:01:39.650 --> 05:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
is an appropriate amount given how tight
 
05:01:42.110 --> 05:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
most County budgets are and how
 
05:01:45.170 --> 05:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
reluctant most County delegates are to
 
05:01:47.230 --> 05:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
raise County taxes
 
05:01:50.570 --> 05:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:01:53.448 --> 05:01:53.458 align:start position:0%
well the five thousand dollars in this
 
05:01:55.970 --> 05:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
particular statute
 
05:01:55.980 --> 05:01:59.330 align:start position:0%
particular statute
um

05:01:59.330 --> 05:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:01.490 --> 05:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
is a benchmark on Capitol building
 
05:02:03.770 --> 05:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
projects and we've seen the Capitol
 
05:02:05.208 --> 05:02:05.218 align:start position:0%
building projects
 
05:02:10.128 --> 05:02:10.138 align:start position:0%
are are um typically much more expensive
 
05:02:14.590 --> 05:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
and even yes while we have an eye on
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to
 
05:02:19.788 --> 05:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
um you know not raise taxes and be
 
05:02:22.690 --> 05:02:22.700 align:start position:0%
mindful of how much our Capitol Building
 
05:02:25.128 --> 05:02:25.138 align:start position:0%
expenses are
 
05:02:25.138 --> 05:02:27.350 align:start position:0%
expenses are
nonetheless

05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
05:02:34.490 --> 05:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:38.270 --> 05:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that you would need
 
05:02:41.090 --> 05:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
County Convention approval much more
 
05:02:41.100 --> 05:02:42.170 align:start position:0%
County Convention approval much more
often

05:02:42.170 --> 05:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
often
 
05:02:42.180 --> 05:02:43.788 align:start position:0%
often
than

05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:02:47.570 --> 05:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
for a five thousand dollar ticketed item
 
05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
a capital project than you would for
 
05:02:52.610 --> 05:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
something more expensive
 
05:02:55.550 --> 05:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I think we would you know with this
 
05:02:59.410 --> 05:02:59.420 align:start position:0%
it's just a more realistic number for
 
05:03:01.850 --> 05:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
many of the Capitol building projects
 
05:03:05.570 --> 05:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing in in our
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
in our projects for you know in in the
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
county in the county
 
05:03:16.750 --> 05:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
05:03:22.910 --> 05:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for uh
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:03:29.628 --> 05:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
in several of these bills we've talked
 
05:03:32.030 --> 05:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
about thresholds
 
05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
and in periods of
 
05:03:35.160 --> 05:03:37.368 align:start position:0%
and in periods of
inflation

05:03:37.368 --> 05:03:37.378 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
05:03:40.010 --> 05:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
like we've had in the last couple of
 
05:03:40.020 --> 05:03:41.750 align:start position:0%
like we've had in the last couple of
years

05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:03:46.128 --> 05:03:46.138 align:start position:0%
these thresholds become very important
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
all through government spending at least
 
05:03:55.310 --> 05:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
in one case we applied a measure of
 
05:03:55.320 --> 05:03:56.868 align:start position:0%
in one case we applied a measure of
inflation

05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was CPI
 
05:04:04.550 --> 05:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
so that the thresholds would not
 
05:04:07.448 --> 05:04:07.458 align:start position:0%
become obsolete
 
05:04:11.330 --> 05:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
immediately and become more so as time
 
05:04:14.570 --> 05:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
went on depending on what the inflation
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
is I'm just wondering in all of these
 
05:04:21.310 --> 05:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
cases where we have thresholds applied
 
05:04:25.490 --> 05:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
would it behoove us to apply some
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
measure of inflation so that next year
 
05:04:35.208 --> 05:04:35.218 align:start position:0%
if if the inflation rate becomes
 
05:04:39.730 --> 05:04:39.740 align:start position:0%
30 percent or if there is a deflation
 
05:04:43.070 --> 05:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
that that would automatically kick into
 
05:04:43.080 --> 05:04:46.128 align:start position:0%
that that would automatically kick into
gear

05:04:46.128 --> 05:04:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:48.410 --> 05:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative La sells I think that's a
 
05:04:50.930 --> 05:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
an excellent observation that perhaps
 
05:04:53.570 --> 05:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
that many of these statutes that we have
 
05:04:57.288 --> 05:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
that have dollar amounts or thresholds
 
05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
like this should indeed be more likely
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
would be more more
 
05:05:04.200 --> 05:05:06.708 align:start position:0%
would be more more
um

05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
better written
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:17.208 --> 05:05:17.218 align:start position:0%
you know Mark to to the rate of
 
05:05:19.970 --> 05:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
inflation instead of a dollar number but
 
05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
we see you know dollar numbers in our
 
05:05:25.850 --> 05:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
statute so I was just looking to make
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
that adjustment
 
05:05:31.490 --> 05:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't be unreasonable to tie
 
05:05:39.430 --> 05:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.230 --> 05:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative menchaputi
 
05:05:44.270 --> 05:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:05:48.530 --> 05:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:48.540 --> 05:05:50.868 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:50.878 --> 05:05:52.250 align:start position:0%
 
sitting

05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
sitting
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
you know counties that have
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County that has a large
 
05:05:56.878 --> 05:05:59.150 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County that has a large
delegation

05:05:59.150 --> 05:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
05:06:02.750 --> 05:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
and having set on the executive
 
05:06:06.410 --> 05:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
committee these thresholds have worked
 
05:06:08.750 --> 05:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
well in terms of having the checks and
 
05:06:08.760 --> 05:06:10.610 align:start position:0%
well in terms of having the checks and
balances

05:06:10.610 --> 05:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
balances
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
and uh so by changing you've seen like
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
by changing in one representative will
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
suspend um could you please again try to
 
05:06:22.080 --> 05:06:23.150 align:start position:0%
suspend um could you please again try to
keep

05:06:23.150 --> 05:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
keep
 
05:06:27.470 --> 05:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
to questions on the
 
05:06:31.368 --> 05:06:31.378 align:start position:0%
on the bill itself rather than getting
 
05:06:31.378 --> 05:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
on the bill itself rather than getting
into

05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say personal history or
 
05:06:36.770 --> 05:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
whatever but let's try to keep this as
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
quick as we can representative manager
 
05:06:41.930 --> 05:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
Puti question clarifying uh testimony
 
05:06:43.368 --> 05:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:45.890 --> 05:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I'll try to because each
 
05:06:49.190 --> 05:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill is kind of tying into the other so
 
05:06:52.670 --> 05:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
every time I ask a question on one bill
 
05:06:55.610 --> 05:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
the next bill changes that or affects
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
that so there is a cascading effect on
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
all the bills that so far so I mean
 
05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
changing one RSA in one place it has a
 
05:07:08.208 --> 05:07:08.218 align:start position:0%
cascading effect have you looked at that
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
in a totality
 
05:07:12.770 --> 05:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
how it's going to impact different
 
05:07:14.890 --> 05:07:14.900 align:start position:0%
locations different
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
rsas that are tied into
 
05:07:20.690 --> 05:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not clear on what your
 
05:07:26.150 --> 05:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
um how how it affects multiple counties
 
05:07:33.708 --> 05:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
or multiple other statutes I mean what
 
05:07:37.930 --> 05:07:37.940 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to do here is to just
 
05:07:41.330 --> 05:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
put in a measure of reality as to how
 
05:07:43.208 --> 05:07:43.218 align:start position:0%
much our Capital
 
05:07:45.530 --> 05:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
Improvement projects the building
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
projects actually cost these days I
 
05:07:50.570 --> 05:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
don't know that you can ever find a
 
05:07:52.970 --> 05:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
capital building project that's uh
 
05:07:55.610 --> 05:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh five thousand dollars anymore
 
05:08:01.010 --> 05:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
and so if you would see if there was a
 
05:08:02.510 --> 05:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
capitol building
 
05:08:05.690 --> 05:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
project that was that amount of money
 
05:08:05.700 --> 05:08:06.830 align:start position:0%
project that was that amount of money
um

05:08:06.830 --> 05:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
that would be more more times that you
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
would have to call the County Convention
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:23.150 --> 05:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
I got one clarifying question along the
 
05:08:25.128 --> 05:08:25.138 align:start position:0%
lines of Representative mandaputi's
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
question is we've seen a lot of
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
different bills today with a lot of
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
dollar figures changing authorized by
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
this authorized by that
 
05:08:38.810 --> 05:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:41.570 --> 05:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
in this case does this bill changing
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
that dollar value effect
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
other parts of the rsas that might that
 
05:08:49.550 --> 05:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
was one of my questions does it impact
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
or conflict with other parts of the rsas
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:04.368 --> 05:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question now that
 
05:09:08.570 --> 05:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
you can hear me
 
05:09:08.580 --> 05:09:10.970 align:start position:0%
you can hear me
um

05:09:10.970 --> 05:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
I'm confused and I hope you can clarify
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
clarify it for me
 
05:09:17.878 --> 05:09:20.030 align:start position:0%
clarify it for me
um

05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.208 --> 05:09:23.218 align:start position:0%
I realized this the only change in in
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is is a dollar amount by the
 
05:09:29.090 --> 05:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
looks of things that yes correct okay
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:33.610 --> 05:09:33.620 align:start position:0%
um but how
 
05:09:37.730 --> 05:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
does does this
 
05:09:37.740 --> 05:09:39.948 align:start position:0%
does does this
RSA

05:09:39.948 --> 05:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:09:39.958 --> 05:09:44.050 align:start position:0%
RSA
authorize

05:09:44.050 --> 05:09:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
the county
 
05:09:46.680 --> 05:09:48.170 align:start position:0%
the county
to

05:09:48.170 --> 05:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:09:51.170 --> 05:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
issue bonds
 
05:09:53.750 --> 05:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
without going through the proper
 
05:09:58.190 --> 05:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:01.010 --> 05:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
no you'd still have to issue
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
well it says the power to raise County
 
05:10:05.510 --> 05:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
taxes to make Appropriations for the use
 
05:10:07.490 --> 05:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
of the county and to authorize the
 
05:10:10.010 --> 05:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
purchase of real estate for its use the
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
sale and conveyance of its real estate
 
05:10:13.368 --> 05:10:13.378 align:start position:0%
the erection enlargement or repair of
 
05:10:15.650 --> 05:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
its buildings exceeding an expensive
 
05:10:17.810 --> 05:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars we want to raise
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
that to twenty five thousand and the
 
05:10:22.250 --> 05:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
issuing of bonds for its debt shall be
 
05:10:25.010 --> 05:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
vested in the County Convention so you'd
 
05:10:26.930 --> 05:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
still have
 
05:10:31.070 --> 05:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
um you know the the County Convention
 
05:10:33.470 --> 05:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
um you know needing to approve any kind
 
05:10:36.530 --> 05:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
of issuing of bonds and debts
 
05:10:36.540 --> 05:10:38.448 align:start position:0%
of issuing of bonds and debts
uh

05:10:38.448 --> 05:10:38.458 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:40.368 --> 05:10:40.378 align:start position:0%
but it would be at a higher dollar
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
amount because the the capital
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
Improvement projects normally are not
 
05:10:47.990 --> 05:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars anymore right
 
05:10:50.090 --> 05:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.570 --> 05:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative uh yokella thank you
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
05:11:00.650 --> 05:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
um you keep on talking about Capital
 
05:11:04.010 --> 05:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
Improvement projects but in fact isn't
 
05:11:07.128 --> 05:11:07.138 align:start position:0%
it the case that you're also
 
05:11:07.138 --> 05:11:07.930 align:start position:0%
it the case that you're also
um

05:11:07.930 --> 05:11:07.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:11.390 --> 05:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
raising the requirement for approval for
 
05:11:13.550 --> 05:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
repairs to buildings
 
05:11:15.948 --> 05:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
from five thousand dollars so if you
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
need you know five thousand dollar fix
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
of of a plumbing issue versus a twenty
 
05:11:22.490 --> 05:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollar fix of appointment
 
05:11:25.368 --> 05:11:25.378 align:start position:0%
May issue only when it reached the level
 
05:11:26.570 --> 05:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
of a twenty five thousand dollar
 
05:11:28.250 --> 05:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
plumbing issue fix would you need to go
 
05:11:30.110 --> 05:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
to the convention
 
05:11:33.288 --> 05:11:33.298 align:start position:0%
okay so but the thing is that Capital
 
05:11:35.690 --> 05:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
repairs and projects from non-capital
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
projects and repair well
 
05:11:41.090 --> 05:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
we have to distinguish the value amounts
 
05:11:43.610 --> 05:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
of this of capital projects and repairs
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
from non-capital projects and repairs
 
05:11:47.510 --> 05:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
and what we're seeing is these capital
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
projects and repairs are no longer
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
around the amount of five thousand
 
05:11:52.200 --> 05:11:53.270 align:start position:0%
around the amount of five thousand
dollars

05:11:53.270 --> 05:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:11:55.788 --> 05:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
and non-capital projects and repairs are
 
05:11:58.610 --> 05:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
already covered in in our budgets
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
so the dollar amounts for those usually
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
are you know we anticipate how much
 
05:12:04.850 --> 05:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
we're going to need for those kinds of
 
05:12:04.860 --> 05:12:06.050 align:start position:0%
we're going to need for those kinds of
projects

05:12:06.050 --> 05:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
projects
 
05:12:12.410 --> 05:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:15.410 --> 05:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Gilman thank you
 
05:12:16.670 --> 05:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
05:12:18.770 --> 05:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I think part of what's
 
05:12:24.170 --> 05:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
a problem here and you can tell me if
 
05:12:25.970 --> 05:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
this is consistent this is what we've
 
05:12:27.890 --> 05:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
been trying to get at
 
05:12:27.900 --> 05:12:28.490 align:start position:0%
been trying to get at
um

05:12:28.490 --> 05:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:30.948 --> 05:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
most of these are even maybe all of
 
05:12:34.190 --> 05:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
these bills that reference a dollar cap
 
05:12:35.650 --> 05:12:35.660 align:start position:0%
or a dollar figure
 
05:12:38.448 --> 05:12:38.458 align:start position:0%
some of them are about revenue and some
 
05:12:41.390 --> 05:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
of them are about sale or or income for
 
05:12:42.590 --> 05:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
the county
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
does this does this last bill which
 
05:12:49.310 --> 05:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
refers to both of those the sale or
 
05:12:53.448 --> 05:12:53.458 align:start position:0%
um you know revenue or an expenditure
 
05:12:57.050 --> 05:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
just get us all messed up again
 
05:12:59.208 --> 05:12:59.218 align:start position:0%
well this is uh regarding buildings
 
05:13:02.448 --> 05:13:02.458 align:start position:0%
exceeding uh the enlargement or repair
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
of its buildings exceeding it's the
 
05:13:04.440 --> 05:13:06.050 align:start position:0%
of its buildings exceeding it's the
capital

05:13:06.050 --> 05:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
capital
 
05:13:08.208 --> 05:13:08.218 align:start position:0%
building expense
 
05:13:10.970 --> 05:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars so and but we're
 
05:13:13.788 --> 05:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
saying that you you won't really see
 
05:13:17.390 --> 05:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
that amount anymore that the the Capitol
 
05:13:19.610 --> 05:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
Building expenses are much more
 
05:13:22.010 --> 05:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
expensive than five thousand dollars
 
05:13:25.490 --> 05:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
hello Mr sure go ahead
 
05:13:27.650 --> 05:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
I I understand that
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and I agree that you know 5000 is no
 
05:13:33.230 --> 05:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
longer uh it doesn't get you much but it
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
does say in the second line real estate
 
05:13:39.650 --> 05:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
for its use the sale in conveyance as
 
05:13:41.770 --> 05:13:41.780 align:start position:0%
well as the erection and enlargement and
 
05:13:46.670 --> 05:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
repair so and previously we got rid of
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
the County Convention having to deal
 
05:13:50.530 --> 05:13:50.540 align:start position:0%
with any of
 
05:13:52.970 --> 05:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know the
 
05:13:56.930 --> 05:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
small smaller smaller items smaller
 
05:13:58.670 --> 05:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
things that you don't want to you know
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
draw the whole County Convention to so
 
05:14:03.470 --> 05:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
my question is are we are we once again
 
05:14:06.770 --> 05:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
getting confused but because we're we're
 
05:14:10.850 --> 05:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
using both uh the expenditure funds and
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
the intake of funds sale versus
 
05:14:17.330 --> 05:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
erection of an enlargement I I think
 
05:14:19.368 --> 05:14:19.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I I think
 
05:14:21.110 --> 05:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
that this is just
 
05:14:23.868 --> 05:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
um trying to distinguish between
 
05:14:25.990 --> 05:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
the reality of what
 
05:14:26.000 --> 05:14:26.390 align:start position:0%
the reality of what
[Music]

05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:14:26.400 --> 05:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:30.590 --> 05:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
are are real capital building project
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
thresholds are
 
05:14:35.390 --> 05:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and and what the non-capital projects
 
05:14:38.208 --> 05:14:38.218 align:start position:0%
and repairs actually cost
 
05:14:38.218 --> 05:14:39.890 align:start position:0%
and repairs actually cost
so

05:14:39.890 --> 05:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:42.110 --> 05:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you I think it would be fair to
 
05:14:45.650 --> 05:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
say that this particular paragraph is on
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
County Convention Powers it's a laundry
 
05:14:52.010 --> 05:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
list of individual items that the County
 
05:14:53.868 --> 05:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
Convention has
 
05:14:56.990 --> 05:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
rule over if you will
 
05:15:00.410 --> 05:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
am I miss I think that's fair to say yes
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so due to the fact
 
05:15:14.650 --> 05:15:14.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:18.650 --> 05:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
involves the enlargement or repair
 
05:15:23.448 --> 05:15:23.458 align:start position:0%
or the erection of buildings as does the
 
05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
previous Bill 83
 
05:15:29.930 --> 05:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
and furthermore since
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
both statutes reference a a dollar
 
05:15:37.368 --> 05:15:37.378 align:start position:0%
threshold of five thousand and in this
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
one the you're changing striking the
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
5000 and making it twenty five thousand
 
05:15:45.470 --> 05:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
whereas in the previous bill it's been
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
deleted do you
 
05:15:50.050 --> 05:15:50.060 align:start position:0%
is there a sense that this might be
 
05:15:53.448 --> 05:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
incongruent with each other and there
 
05:15:55.970 --> 05:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
may be a problem
 
05:15:58.430 --> 05:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think so but I would defer that
 
05:16:05.330 --> 05:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:08.750 --> 05:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Aaron
 
05:16:13.128 --> 05:16:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:17.448 --> 05:16:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:20.090 --> 05:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
before you start Miss Ferlin I think
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's maybe a general sense maybe I'm
 
05:16:23.810 --> 05:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
misreading it but I think
 
05:16:25.610 --> 05:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
a bunch of us
 
05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:16:29.570 --> 05:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
believe that a lot of these changes may
 
05:16:32.330 --> 05:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
be interfering with impacting
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
conflicting with others
 
05:16:37.490 --> 05:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure how that's going to
 
05:16:37.500 --> 05:16:39.410 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure how that's going to
be

05:16:39.410 --> 05:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:16:43.128 --> 05:16:43.138 align:start position:0%
excuse me thanks Mr chair but yes excuse
 
05:16:43.138 --> 05:16:43.850 align:start position:0%
excuse me thanks Mr chair but yes excuse
me

05:16:43.850 --> 05:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:16:43.860 --> 05:16:44.390 align:start position:0%
me
um

05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:47.390 --> 05:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
I must ask a point of order it's very
 
05:16:49.788 --> 05:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
clear that we don't impugn
 
05:16:51.530 --> 05:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
um others thoughts or ideas when we're
 
05:16:53.628 --> 05:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
on the house floor and I think that the
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
same thing holds here so I'd prefer that
 
05:16:59.208 --> 05:16:59.218 align:start position:0%
you not State how I might be feeling in
 
05:17:01.670 --> 05:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
regards to any of this thank you sure
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
I'll take that under advisement
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative so go ahead
 
05:17:07.250 --> 05:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and once again
 
05:17:08.510 --> 05:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh Derek
 
05:17:09.770 --> 05:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
Ferrell and Sullivan County Manager
 
05:17:13.070 --> 05:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of house bill 87.
 
05:17:13.080 --> 05:17:13.910 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of house bill 87.
um

05:17:13.910 --> 05:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
very simply the the dollar threshold
 
05:17:19.730 --> 05:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
raise was really pegged to our
 
05:17:23.150 --> 05:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
um counties approach to Capital versus
 
05:17:26.810 --> 05:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
non-capital projects uh I referenced my
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
my prior career as an Air Force civil
 
05:17:28.680 --> 05:17:29.868 align:start position:0%
my prior career as an Air Force civil
engineer

05:17:29.868 --> 05:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
05:17:33.170 --> 05:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
um 25 000 was was widely accepted and I
 
05:17:34.550 --> 05:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
would go so far as to say an industry
 
05:17:36.410 --> 05:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
standard for what's deemed to be a
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
capital project and so we that's how we
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
internally treat uh during our budget
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
process there are things that we know
 
05:17:45.050 --> 05:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
are going to repair that are just
 
05:17:46.550 --> 05:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
run-of-the-mill repairs to our
 
05:17:48.890 --> 05:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
facilities and those May cost you know
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
anywhere from very little very few
 
05:17:53.090 --> 05:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
dollars to sometimes very thousands of
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
dollars but we make a distinction with
 
05:17:57.050 --> 05:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
anything that's going to be projected to
 
05:17:59.330 --> 05:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
cost over 25 000 it gets its own
 
05:18:02.090 --> 05:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
treatment in our budget and in our
 
05:18:04.250 --> 05:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
budget presentations
 
05:18:05.868 --> 05:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
um so this was just an attempt to try to
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
standardize that language I would say
 
05:18:10.788 --> 05:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
that regardless of whether it's a repair
 
05:18:13.610 --> 05:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
that's done under our other budget
 
05:18:15.288 --> 05:18:15.298 align:start position:0%
category for just general maintenance
 
05:18:17.930 --> 05:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
and repair of different facilities the
 
05:18:19.550 --> 05:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
delegation has oversight of all of that
 
05:18:21.470 --> 05:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
just by virtue of of appropriating and
 
05:18:23.810 --> 05:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
passing a budget we just provide special
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
attention to those repairs that we call
 
05:18:27.948 --> 05:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
Capital and we've Associated that with a
 
05:18:30.530 --> 05:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
25 000 threshold
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
um in reference to the previous
 
05:18:33.770 --> 05:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
questions about cascading and impacts of
 
05:18:37.010 --> 05:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
other rsas the answer is yes that's
 
05:18:38.810 --> 05:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
specifically why we struck the reference
 
05:18:41.448 --> 05:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
to five thousand dollars and 28.5 and
 
05:18:44.270 --> 05:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
28.7 just to clarify it because they are
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
all interchanged but it should only be
 
05:18:48.170 --> 05:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
referenced once in my opinion just for
 
05:18:50.810 --> 05:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
Simplicity and to avoid the possibility
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
of introducing unforced errors so once
 
05:18:56.510 --> 05:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
the County Convention has approved a
 
05:18:58.788 --> 05:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
budget which includes sub-capital as
 
05:19:01.250 --> 05:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
well as capital requirements then all
 
05:19:03.530 --> 05:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
the other rsas simply fall in line once
 
05:19:04.970 --> 05:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
you have that Authority that's been
 
05:19:09.288 --> 05:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:13.250 --> 05:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:16.010 --> 05:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
I apologize that's escaping me
 
05:19:16.020 --> 05:19:18.110 align:start position:0%
I apologize that's escaping me
um

05:19:18.110 --> 05:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:19.970 --> 05:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
well I guess I'll end it there and wait
 
05:19:21.770 --> 05:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
for any other follow-up questions thanks
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair okay thank you for your
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions
 
05:19:28.190 --> 05:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
for taking a question so to the point
 
05:19:34.730 --> 05:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
that you just raised about
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the cascading effect or or trying to
 
05:19:39.890 --> 05:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
eliminate or prevent that cascading
 
05:19:39.900 --> 05:19:41.208 align:start position:0%
eliminate or prevent that cascading
effect

05:19:41.208 --> 05:19:41.218 align:start position:0%
effect
 
05:19:45.470 --> 05:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
would it make any sense to then state in
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
these proposed bills a clause as
 
05:19:53.448 --> 05:19:53.458 align:start position:0%
referenced in RSA whatever it is because
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
and I asked that question because
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise I as a freshman or a layperson
 
05:20:04.670 --> 05:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
has no idea that there is any other
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
reference anywhere else and I say that
 
05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
with all due respect that that may
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
create an entirely
 
05:20:13.730 --> 05:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
onerous problem of administration for
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
you but I
 
05:20:16.910 --> 05:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise I don't know how to get around
 
05:20:18.830 --> 05:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
this so I apologize for the lengthy
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair
 
05:20:21.650 --> 05:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I I
 
05:20:23.090 --> 05:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree if I understand you
 
05:20:24.650 --> 05:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
correctly what I would Envision then is
 
05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
in rsas 28 5 and 7 for example we could
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
add a little Clause that says as per RSA
 
05:20:32.990 --> 05:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
2413 and then everything points back to
 
05:20:35.150 --> 05:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
the source document and I I think that
 
05:20:38.208 --> 05:20:38.218 align:start position:0%
would be a a value-added amendment to
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
those other rsas just to make sure that
 
05:20:42.170 --> 05:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
everything's in sync oh I do remember Mr
 
05:20:43.128 --> 05:20:43.138 align:start position:0%
chair what I was going to say before
 
05:20:46.190 --> 05:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
about the um uh the question from
 
05:20:47.628 --> 05:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
representative LaSalle is about whether
 
05:20:50.330 --> 05:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
or not we should do an index reference
 
05:20:53.628 --> 05:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
inflation versus coming back every so
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
often to have these discussions uh which
 
05:20:57.948 --> 05:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
I've enjoyed thoroughly uh you guys
 
05:21:00.590 --> 05:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
probably might I might disagree but I I
 
05:21:02.330 --> 05:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
think it's it's whichever way we want to
 
05:21:03.770 --> 05:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
go about it I think if you do the
 
05:21:05.448 --> 05:21:05.458 align:start position:0%
inflationary index you never have to
 
05:21:07.430 --> 05:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
come back and see me again
 
05:21:09.650 --> 05:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
um but then you'd have authorization
 
05:21:11.330 --> 05:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
limits that one year it's a nice round
 
05:21:12.650 --> 05:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
number like three thousand or five
 
05:21:13.850 --> 05:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
thousand and then the next year it's
 
05:21:16.368 --> 05:21:16.378 align:start position:0%
five thousand and eleven and probably
 
05:21:17.810 --> 05:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
with some pennies and I think that would
 
05:21:19.610 --> 05:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
be a little bit awkward but certainly
 
05:21:22.368 --> 05:21:22.378 align:start position:0%
not inaccurate and it would avoid the
 
05:21:23.690 --> 05:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
administrative headache of having to
 
05:21:25.610 --> 05:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
come back and do this so it's I guess
 
05:21:27.650 --> 05:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
there are probably equal pros and cons
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
to whichever approach but at least
 
05:21:31.310 --> 05:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
having um
 
05:21:33.110 --> 05:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
the ability to come have a discussion
 
05:21:35.628 --> 05:21:35.638 align:start position:0%
you can you know I guess decide what
 
05:21:37.070 --> 05:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
makes more sense if you're just strictly
 
05:21:38.990 --> 05:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
following inflation then decide whatever
 
05:21:41.090 --> 05:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
that index should be and and call it a
 
05:21:41.100 --> 05:21:42.288 align:start position:0%
that index should be and and call it a
day

05:21:42.288 --> 05:21:42.298 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:21:42.298 --> 05:21:45.948 align:start position:0%
day
um

05:21:45.948 --> 05:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:47.570 --> 05:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
darn it I did it again I had two points
 
05:21:48.830 --> 05:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
and now the other one escaped me so I
 
05:21:48.840 --> 05:21:52.550 align:start position:0%
and now the other one escaped me so I
apologize

05:21:52.550 --> 05:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
05:21:55.320 --> 05:21:57.368 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
oh

05:21:57.368 --> 05:21:57.378 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
I got it back uh regarding the the
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
comment about the the
 
05:22:02.638 --> 05:22:03.288 align:start position:0%
comment about the the
um

05:22:03.288 --> 05:22:03.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:06.170 --> 05:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
the conflicting all these rsas I can I
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
can appreciate I live this every almost
 
05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
every day probably weekly I'm digging
 
05:22:12.530 --> 05:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
into the RSA so I can appreciate that
 
05:22:14.448 --> 05:22:14.458 align:start position:0%
I've got a lot more familiarity for
 
05:22:17.030 --> 05:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
better or worse than you all do and I
 
05:22:19.490 --> 05:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
agree it can be probably a bit daunting
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
I do think if you break it down into the
 
05:22:26.208 --> 05:22:26.218 align:start position:0%
the terminology and thinking about what
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
do we think the the framers of our rsas
 
05:22:31.430 --> 05:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
meant by the enumerated powers in terms
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
of what's real estate real property I
 
05:22:33.948 --> 05:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
think there's some tweaks that could
 
05:22:36.770 --> 05:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely benefit and clear things up
 
05:22:38.750 --> 05:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
um but I also think that when we looked
 
05:22:41.090 --> 05:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
at the various rsas we talk about the
 
05:22:43.550 --> 05:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
difference of enlarging or erecting
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
buildings versus disposing and so I
 
05:22:47.510 --> 05:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
think those are all
 
05:22:51.170 --> 05:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
distinct actions that these bills if you
 
05:22:52.550 --> 05:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
go back and look at them again I think
 
05:22:55.670 --> 05:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
there are there's less overlap in
 
05:22:57.288 --> 05:22:57.298 align:start position:0%
confusion than maybe what appears today
 
05:22:58.610 --> 05:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
because you've just gotten the fire hose
 
05:23:01.610 --> 05:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
treatment of getting bombarded with all
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
eight chapters of the county rsas that
 
05:23:05.868 --> 05:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
probably before today you might not have
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
even known existed so
 
05:23:10.368 --> 05:23:10.378 align:start position:0%
um I do think there's it's more distinct
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
in separate Lanes of action that we're
 
05:23:14.208 --> 05:23:14.218 align:start position:0%
requesting and I do think if you trace
 
05:23:17.208 --> 05:23:17.218 align:start position:0%
it all back it does preserve the
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
authority and legal responsibility of
 
05:23:20.570 --> 05:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
each branch of government I do think it
 
05:23:22.730 --> 05:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
there's a nice perfect complementary
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
relationship between what the delegation
 
05:23:26.810 --> 05:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
is required to do and then what the
 
05:23:28.970 --> 05:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are required to do as per
 
05:23:30.530 --> 05:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
the rsas I just think with a few little
 
05:23:32.810 --> 05:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
tweaks we could clear up any
 
05:23:35.090 --> 05:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings or confusion and and
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
we'll all be much better off for it
 
05:23:40.970 --> 05:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
for the questions uh representative
 
05:23:45.288 --> 05:23:45.298 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:23:46.430 --> 05:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
for thank you for taking another
 
05:23:48.590 --> 05:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
question that last statement that you
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
made is exactly what I was trying to get
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
to so my question is why does this one
 
05:23:55.128 --> 05:23:55.138 align:start position:0%
use the word sale
 
05:23:55.138 --> 05:23:56.270 align:start position:0%
use the word sale
and

05:23:56.270 --> 05:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:58.490 --> 05:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
erection and enlargement and give it a
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
dollar value that um
 
05:24:03.530 --> 05:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
shall be vested in the County Convention
 
05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
and the other ones take the sale out you
 
05:24:08.570 --> 05:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
know or take it away from the County
 
05:24:08.580 --> 05:24:10.730 align:start position:0%
know or take it away from the County
Convention

05:24:10.730 --> 05:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
Convention
 
05:24:12.590 --> 05:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gilman for the
 
05:24:14.030 --> 05:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
question that actually is another thing
 
05:24:16.310 --> 05:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
that I forgot to mention which is I
 
05:24:20.650 --> 05:24:20.660 align:start position:0%
would strongly Advocate as a non uh
 
05:24:23.810 --> 05:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
granitarian uh English major but I did
 
05:24:25.368 --> 05:24:25.378 align:start position:0%
have Mr Couture for eighth grade eighth
 
05:24:26.628 --> 05:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
grade English and grammar and he was
 
05:24:26.638 --> 05:24:27.948 align:start position:0%
grade English and grammar and he was
phenomenal

05:24:27.948 --> 05:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
phenomenal
 
05:24:29.150 --> 05:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I think that there should be
 
05:24:31.490 --> 05:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
semicolons delineating the items in that
 
05:24:35.690 --> 05:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
list to distinguish those commas from
 
05:24:38.150 --> 05:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
the comma that appears between the words
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
erection and enlargement
 
05:24:44.208 --> 05:24:44.218 align:start position:0%
uh because I think the 25 000 is meant
 
05:24:46.550 --> 05:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
to only apply to the section that says
 
05:24:49.070 --> 05:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
the erection enlargement or repair of
 
05:24:51.170 --> 05:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
its buildings exceeding an expense of 25
 
05:24:53.570 --> 05:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
000 and using semicolons for the other
 
05:24:56.208 --> 05:24:56.218 align:start position:0%
items would clearly indicate that the 25
 
05:25:00.170 --> 05:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
000 does not apply to the purchase of
 
05:25:02.208 --> 05:25:02.218 align:start position:0%
real estate uh the sale and conveyance
 
05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
of its real estate so I think that's
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
where commas versus semicolons matter
 
05:25:08.448 --> 05:25:08.458 align:start position:0%
and I think this is one indication or an
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
example of where
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
um it is confusing
 
05:25:18.410 --> 05:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:22.190 --> 05:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.410 --> 05:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.270 --> 05:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
oops having no more pink cards will
 
05:25:37.490 --> 05:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:41.208 --> 05:25:41.218 align:start position:0%
so that was our last one for today
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
um just want to go over next week's
 
05:25:43.680 --> 05:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
um just want to go over next week's
schedule

05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
05:25:47.628 --> 05:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
uh the bill should be posted here
 
05:25:51.770 --> 05:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
shortly on next Wednesday we will meet
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
as a committee for uh some more hearings
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock on Wednesday again
 
05:26:02.030 --> 05:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
the following day Thursday I think
 
05:26:04.070 --> 05:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
um we mentioned that it's we have just
 
05:26:05.208 --> 05:26:05.218 align:start position:0%
so many bills we're gonna have to do
 
05:26:07.550 --> 05:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
more work than a single day at least the
 
05:26:09.590 --> 05:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
plan is to get ahead rather than fall
 
05:26:14.990 --> 05:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
behind so on Thursday morning we will
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to exec execut exec a lot of the
 
05:26:21.650 --> 05:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
bills that we did today on Thursday
 
05:26:21.660 --> 05:26:22.850 align:start position:0%
bills that we did today on Thursday
morning

05:26:22.850 --> 05:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
morning
 
05:26:25.490 --> 05:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
and then in the F that'll be uh starting
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
at 10 30 that'll give
 
05:26:27.840 --> 05:26:28.610 align:start position:0%
at 10 30 that'll give
um

05:26:28.610 --> 05:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:32.570 --> 05:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
should you each caucus decide uh to hold
 
05:26:35.690 --> 05:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
the caucus prior to that uh enough time
 
05:26:37.490 --> 05:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
to do that so on Thursday morning we'll
 
05:26:42.830 --> 05:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
begin at 10 30. and then at 1 30 we will
 
05:26:42.840 --> 05:26:43.550 align:start position:0%
begin at 10 30. and then at 1 30 we will
um

05:26:43.550 --> 05:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:46.010 --> 05:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
do four more
 
05:26:49.550 --> 05:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh bills in a hearing so
 
05:26:55.430 --> 05:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
all hearing all Pub uh all bills and
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
then on Thursday it'll be 10 30 morning
 
05:27:05.868 --> 05:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
executing bills afternoon four more
 
05:27:05.878 --> 05:27:08.448 align:start position:0%
executing bills afternoon four more
bills

05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:08.458 --> 05:27:12.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:15.230 --> 05:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
so there were several bills um that we
 
05:27:17.690 --> 05:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
heard today that I believe you would
 
05:27:20.810 --> 05:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
like to exec next week where we
 
05:27:24.170 --> 05:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
suggested or asked for amendments and
 
05:27:26.690 --> 05:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
the sponsors agreed to those amendments
 
05:27:29.930 --> 05:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
and I would like to see those amendments
 
05:27:33.410 --> 05:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
prior to executing any of the bills
 
05:27:35.810 --> 05:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
absolutely any amendments I know we had
 
05:27:39.610 --> 05:27:39.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron and
 
05:27:46.190 --> 05:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
the County administrator will have some
 
05:27:48.590 --> 05:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
amendments for us but that's an
 
05:27:50.750 --> 05:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
excellent point we should have those uh
 
05:27:53.390 --> 05:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
at least by Wednesday morning Tuesday
 
05:27:57.230 --> 05:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
and it would be helpful
 
05:28:03.110 --> 05:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned several times that
 
05:28:06.530 --> 05:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
if there's one on especially your bills
 
05:28:09.170 --> 05:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron where we have so
 
05:28:10.730 --> 05:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
many of them and they all have different
 
05:28:13.910 --> 05:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollar figures if and where they impact
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
the other if we can somehow reference
 
05:28:16.798 --> 05:28:17.868 align:start position:0%
the other if we can somehow reference
that

05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
so we're not so some of us aren't uh
 
05:28:26.448 --> 05:28:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:30.110 --> 05:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:54.110 --> 05:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:57.530 --> 05:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
I I would think if I think that's an
 
05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
excellent idea not only because uh it
 
05:29:00.480 --> 05:29:01.730 align:start position:0%
excellent idea not only because uh it
might

05:29:01.730 --> 05:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
ensure the passage of some of their
 
05:29:06.110 --> 05:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
bills rather than yes not so that might
 
05:29:09.470 --> 05:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
be to their advantage to do so yes
 
05:29:12.650 --> 05:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative
 
05:29:15.170 --> 05:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
I think it is an excellent idea but the
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
fact remains that we have heard each
 
05:29:18.650 --> 05:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
bill individually
 
05:29:21.650 --> 05:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
and are therefore
 
05:29:23.628 --> 05:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
under some obligation I mean the bills
 
05:29:25.128 --> 05:29:25.138 align:start position:0%
are ours now they've come to our
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee in their hours we can do what
 
05:29:29.390 --> 05:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
we wish but I think that we are under
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
some obligation to dispose of each bill
 
05:29:31.920 --> 05:29:34.250 align:start position:0%
some obligation to dispose of each bill
individually

05:29:34.250 --> 05:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
individually
 
05:29:34.260 --> 05:29:34.850 align:start position:0%
individually
um

05:29:34.850 --> 05:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:38.030 --> 05:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not we get an overview of all
 
05:29:39.530 --> 05:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
of them I just I just want to make sure
 
05:29:42.190 --> 05:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
that we yeah totally understand
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:51.230 --> 05:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:29:56.510 --> 05:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is one County out of
 
05:29:59.390 --> 05:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
10. so we have heard from one County
 
05:30:02.208 --> 05:30:02.218 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to fix and how it
 
05:30:02.218 --> 05:30:04.390 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to fix and how it
impacts

05:30:04.390 --> 05:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
05:30:08.030 --> 05:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh nine other counties
 
05:30:10.850 --> 05:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
you know that's for us to make the
 
05:30:12.590 --> 05:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
determination from where we are coming
 
05:30:15.830 --> 05:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
from and how it would impact
 
05:30:15.840 --> 05:30:18.230 align:start position:0%
from and how it would impact
correct

05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:30:20.690 --> 05:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
we don't just some of us do not disagree
 
05:30:23.868 --> 05:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
with that representative yokella
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh
 
05:30:31.490 --> 05:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
in in uh prior sessions
 
05:30:34.730 --> 05:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
um is my understanding that we can only
 
05:30:34.740 --> 05:30:35.350 align:start position:0%
um is my understanding that we can only
um

05:30:35.350 --> 05:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
propose in executive session amendments
 
05:30:42.170 --> 05:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
that we a member of the
 
05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
um the committee are uh sponsor of
 
05:30:47.638 --> 05:30:48.650 align:start position:0%
um the committee are uh sponsor of
um

05:30:48.650 --> 05:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:51.230 --> 05:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
can you have you made a ruling on that
 
05:30:53.930 --> 05:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
for this term has that role changed I
 
05:30:55.510 --> 05:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe the rules changed but
 
05:30:59.810 --> 05:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
we've had uh individuals the sponsors do
 
05:31:01.670 --> 05:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
the Amendments before okay I don't see
 
05:31:09.050 --> 05:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:09.060 --> 05:31:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:31:10.310 --> 05:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:11.750 --> 05:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
I think we're done for the day we'll see
 
05:31:33.970 --> 05:31:33.980 align:start position:0%
