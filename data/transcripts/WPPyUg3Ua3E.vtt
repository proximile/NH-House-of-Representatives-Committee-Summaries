00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 align:start position:0%
in saying we think there's four issues
 
00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
we need to work on and make
 
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the
 
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
Judiciary the Judiciary having listened
 
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
in carefully either in person or by Zoom
 
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
or both um has already started to
 
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
implement some of these um which means
 
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
for a bunch of non- lawyers we didn't
 
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
get it too bad up here and we now have
 
00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
two final subcommittee reports that we
 
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
will hear you should have copies of of
 
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
them and we'll talk about them and I
 
00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
hope uh approve them and then there's
 
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
one final agenda item after that so the
 
00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on Guardian
 
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
limp parenting coordinator
 
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
role uh the chair of that is
 
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
representative katab would you uh
 
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
present your subcommittee's report
 
00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
please sure do you want me to read the
 
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
report or just go over highlight I'd say
 
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
go over the highlights okay so this
 
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was formed to look into
 
00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
Guardian at lims and also parenting
 
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
coordinators and we ended up mostly
 
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
focusing on the parenting coordinator
 
00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 align:start position:0%
model and house belill 1263 was passed
 
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
through the house it's now in Senate
 
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary it got introduced last
 
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 align:start position:0%
Thursday so it hasn't been voted on
 
00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:23.670 align:start position:0%
Thursday so it hasn't been voted on
there

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
yet we felt like the parenting
 
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
coordinator might offer a little bit of
 
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.429 align:start position:0%
coordinator might offer a little bit of
a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
kind of a way of looking at a way of
 
00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue for now and
 
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
we've asked in the meantime when it's a
 
00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 align:start position:0%
budget year if the court could collect
 
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
some data on G's which they were amable
 
00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 align:start position:0%
to doing um mostly
 
00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
just collecting on you know when a g
 
00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
would have been used but perhaps
 
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't have couldn't have been
 
00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
afforded and similarly if the if the
 
00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator is passed we'd
 
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
also like to know how often it's used
 
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
and then how often parties end up
 
00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
agreeing on something just to kind of
 
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
have a few data points so I believe the
 
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
court has two judges that hear many of
 
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
these cases and they were going to those
 
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
two judges are going to kind of track
 
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
when they would have used a jail just to
 
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
kind of because there's no really not a
 
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
great way of tracking that piece but I
 
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
believe it's two is that right two three
 
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay three judges so that will be
 
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
tracked because that's kind of something
 
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.710 align:start position:0%
tracked because that's kind of something
that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
really needs to be looked at in a budget
 
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 align:start position:0%
year not in a not in a non-budget year
 
00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 align:start position:0%
so that was where we left off there was
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
we ended up with the hb1 1263 and we
 
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 align:start position:0%
own happy to answer any questions if
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
anybody on the committee had
 
00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
any attorney krian you want to respond
 
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
to this uh give us a little update from
 
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 align:start position:0%
please good morning Erin crean general
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
counsel for the judicial branch um I I
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
think I have to start by thanking the
 
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
committee so much for their interest in
 
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
this topic and and How Deeply immersed
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
you got into the work of the Family
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
Division I think you saw yourself
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
personally many cases where litigants
 
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 align:start position:0%
would have benefited from or appreciated
 
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh the assistance of either Guardians at
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
Lia or or other models um it is a little
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to track how consistently
 
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're not able to make
 
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
appointments and so we're going to work
 
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
on that anecdotal sample which will
 
00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 align:start position:0%
hopefully be helpful uh to you with our
 
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
our very um large marital docket judges
 
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
tracking it and it will out of the total
 
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
number of cases they look at that may
 
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
give you an idea of how common it is uh
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
I personally did a fair amount of
 
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
research looking through old budget
 
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
codes with LBA trying to find out how
 
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
much this was funded at the past it
 
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
appears the code was reused uh for
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
another fund uh so the amounts that I
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
saw in some of the old budgets they they
 
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
they're clearly the the modern version
 
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
of that fund and not the historical
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
potentially larger than the actual past
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures were too bad this is being
 
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.830 align:start position:0%
expenditures were too bad this is being
recorded

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
huh well I I I want to be transparent I
 
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
know how frustrating it is that we we
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to find this number I
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
went and had a big stack of paper files
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
from one of our long time judges that I
 
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
was kind of rooting through thinking for
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
sure he had printed it out at one point
 
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
um but I I I don't think we're able to
 
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly how much the fund was
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
before it's certainly in the hundreds of
 
00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
thousands um so hopefully this anecdotal
 
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
sample will be helpful to you and just
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate so much the committee's
 
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 align:start position:0%

Representatives cab lonza Pearson and

myself when we last met I uh did submit
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
um the draft up until then um of the uh
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
of this subcommittee and I will not uh
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
go through all of that now because it's
 
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
already in the record but I'd like to
 
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 align:start position:0%
bring it up to date um and I'm going to
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
start um after um the text of the draft
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
includes the Supreme Court rule
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%

what follows is
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
this um the thought that it would be

demonstrates to the committee that the

Supreme Court does not take seriously
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
the need for training before the judge
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
is assigned
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%

00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
the courts do not play a role in um in

appointing the
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%

has been made by the governor and uh

shares as we understand at three staff
 
00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
attorneys the subcommittee did develop a
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
whole series of questions um on uh what
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
is reasonable to expect
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
um for a
 
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.670 align:start position:0%
um for a
system

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh to be initiated uh which judges
 
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
should be required what about the
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
absence of support staff how do you
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
include in their decisions and
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
explanation of why they reach their
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
decision would requiring mediation
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
effectively reduce case loads and
 
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
therefore the time that any Cas is in
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
the system what specific staff should be
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
added to the court with responsibilities
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
to best manage inhouse and an external
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
training um and then there's some other
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
factors also about having um a big
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
brother or big sister in effect an
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
experienced judge paired with a judge
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
with no
 
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
experience um is it possible to have a
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
regular uh schedule of
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
supervision um
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
and might there be cases that could best
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
be handled outside the judicial system
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
for in order to a better meet the needs
 
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
of the citizens and more
 
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.509 align:start position:0%
of the citizens and more
completely

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
um uh again find a way to lessen to some
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
degree the case load that makes it
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
almost impossible for for
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
thoughtful uh judges to have as much
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
time as they need to make an informed
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
decision as we sit here today on April
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
2nd um House Bill
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
10:05 um which has to do with Education
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
and Training of Judges has passed the
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
house and is in um the finance committee
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
by the end of the day today it is highly
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
possible that that bill will have passed
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
out of the finance committee at the
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
moment it has been combined with two
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
other bills one of them being um the uh
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh a bale Reform Bill um uh and those of
 
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
us sitting here would prefer that the
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
bill be floating its own vote but that's
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
not the way finance committee sees it at
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
the moment the bill does however despite
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
a good deal of push back from some
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
principles involved the bill does
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
provide the specific number of hours for
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
training for judges and staff and for
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
the staff to plan and execute specific
 
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.030 align:start position:0%
the staff to plan and execute specific
training

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
requirements um it also has uh protected
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
the word shall rather than May um in
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
order to help
 
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.590 align:start position:0%
order to help
um

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
reinforce what I'm sure is the Court's
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
commitment to good training but what I
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
know is the legislator's commitment to
 
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
know is the legislator's commitment to
appropriate

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
training this legislation House Bill 105
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
which will end up with a different
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
number by the time it works its way
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
through would help help make it possible
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
for the courts to better carry out what
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
the legislature considers to be
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
essential in order for the Circuit Court
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature to best meet
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
the needs of New Hampshire

interact thank you Mr chairman again
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
Erin krian general counsel of the
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
judicial branch um one of the things
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
that I have observed in the work of the
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I and I haven't even been
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
in my position for all of it um is that
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
the courts continue in the way that
 
00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
things are done and there are some very
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
very good ideas um that point out things
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
that now that I reflect on them
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes appear obvious uh
 
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's suggestion of
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
having more staff attorneys in the
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
circuit court is an excellent suggestion
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh that is a uh the life of a circuit
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
court judge is a harried existence with
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
very um little of the support that one
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
typically thinks of when one imagines a
 
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
judge um I often think of them as
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh they just go and work
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
and work and sometimes I talk to them
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
and they tell me that they have had
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
stress dreams about how many orders they
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
need to get out and and ensuring that
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
people do get timely Justice uh so I
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
know that this is um that that's a very
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and good suggestion it's it's
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
appeared in some of my fiscal notes now
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh where I say well maybe we could do
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
more with a staff attorney here as
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh requesting a full new
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
judge um and I know that many people in
 
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
this committee have been supportive of
 
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759 align:start position:0%
uh having more judges as well um and
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
have had other really great ideas about
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
Staffing and and doing things
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
differently uh and the Circuit Court uh
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
represent ball I think of your
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion of working with the
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Education which was
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
excellent um it was it was intuitive it
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
it was just not something that we knew
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
to even ask or pursue and and we are
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
getting enrolled in that program now so
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
that we can have more people coming from
 
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
high school to work in the courts uh so
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
some of these suggestions have just well
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
all of the suggestions are are
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
appreciated but some of them are things
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't think of ourselves they're
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're more creative looking at other
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
states um imagining different ways that
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
things could be done knowing how other
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
parts of the government work from the
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
different other committees that you're
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
on or from your own past Public Service
 
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519 align:start position:0%
in other areas um so it's it's something
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
that um I've really appreciated and uh I
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
think that that suggestion here is I
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
almost feel a little bit silly for not
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
having thought of it because when you
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
say it it makes so much sense um but
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's we we are used to persisting
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes in in the way that things have
 
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.309 align:start position:0%
sometimes in in the way that things have
been

00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
done um
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
I I I I do appreciate I just want to
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
comment very briefly on um the issue
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
that um that you mentioned rip Smith
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
I when I took this uh position I read a
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
few hundred pages of the uh relationship
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
between the legislature and the judicial
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
branch in the state of New Hampshire uh
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
which is a a very interesting history
 
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
and I I complimented uh representative
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
Lyn I told him that he was throughout
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
that history i' had seen his influence
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
in in Bar review articles and cases that
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
he determined um and I would not want
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
the judicial Branch's position on the
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
training issue to be taken as anything
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
that impedes their respect that the
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
judicial branch has for a recommendation
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
or for an observation that comes from
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature um you know that respect
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
exists in a in a hearing in a verbal
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
communication of a suggestion in a bill
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
um in in any form that it's received um
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
I know that there is great comedy
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
between the branches of government in
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire my most recent Billet was
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
working for the US Senate Judiciary
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
Committee the relationship between the
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
US Senate Judiciary Committee and the US
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
Federal Judiciary is not uh not this
 
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
collegial uh not characterized by this
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
level of of Comedy uh and close work
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
together uh I don't say that to be to be
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
negative on anyone there it's just
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
there's no history like the history that
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
there is here for the collaboration
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
between branches um so although that
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
remains the position it is not in any
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
way a uh a challenge to the power of the
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
legislature which is vast um the
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
legislature can destroy courts establish
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
new judgeships lower the maximum penalty
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
for murder to a year establish new civil
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
actions amongst many other things um the
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
power of the legislature um over the
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
court system is almost unlimited it has
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
simply been our position that there is a
 
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
very small Zone which is typically the
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
inner administrative work of the
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that is um the independence of
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary that training does come
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
within in the same way that discipline
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
came within in in R Petition of JCC um
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
when it the Supreme Court adjudicated it
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
a couple decades ago uh so I I I know
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
that this is a disagreement and it's and
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's a respectful disagreement um and I
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
would I hope that disagreement is is
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
taken in the spirit of great respect for
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
the role of the legislature to make
 
00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
policy determinations great respect for
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
the work that you put into them and how
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
good these suggestions are and how much
 
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.310 align:start position:0%
good these suggestions are and how much
they're

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
appreciated um but a difference of
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
opinion on a constitutional
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
matter before the committee had its
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
special committee had its first meeting
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
I spent some time with administrative
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
judge king and supreme Chief McDonald
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
and it was like a first
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
date and where you're trying not to make
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
a fool of yourself and try to make a
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
good impression and you're inching
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully realistically closer to each
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
other and what we all discovered is we
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to gang up against problems not
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
each other irrespective of what previous
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
iterations of special committee on the
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
courts may or may not have done and it
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
was that tone that continued and uh so
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
commentary um in terms of outside eyes
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
and your um embarrassment at not seeing
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
something I bring in occasionally
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
patients from the medical practice I'm
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
part-time CEO of
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
because the people who work for me are
 
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
so on top of what they're doing they see
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
that better than anyone and they also
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
miss things that people from a distance
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
can see so I intentionally bring in
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
certain patients that I know to be
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
articulate and savvy
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
and say please give a critique and I I
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
interrupt them after 4 minutes of lavish
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
praise saying thank you very much
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate that now how can we fix some
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
things gang up with us and they're
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
helpful and it's not because my staff
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
isn't capable it's they're in a silo and
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
the other people have outside eyes and
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's all to the
 
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.630 align:start position:0%
that's all to the
good

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
um if the question on any particular
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
issue issue where we apparently think
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
you should do something and you're
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
having some hesitancy if it is a
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
question of time or money or staff those
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
are issues that can be worked on
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
together as the next budget's put
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
together um also I am wondering uh about
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
the initial training if it should be
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
different if a new judge was previously
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
let me use the British terms a solicitor
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
rather than a barrister if you've got
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
newly appointed judges who don't try
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
cases in court but are real estate
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys and don't go to court but do
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
wonderful work might the training to be
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
a judge be longer and more intensive
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
than the training for a lawyer who has
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
been in court regularly or what if in a
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
different field I have a friend in
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
another state who is observing the Court
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court for similar reasons who
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
tells me how a wonderful lawyer was just
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
appointed to family court and for 20
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
years he was very distinguished as a
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
patent attorney and I offer that I
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
probably know more about Family Court
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
than he does so mightn't the initial
 
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
training be
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
um more structured around different
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
needs of incoming judges uh just a
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
thought I think that's a that's a very
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
apt observation and it does it does need
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be um changed depending on who is
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
coming in a a former marital Master is
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
very knowledgeable a a former prosecutor
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
is going to be great in District
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
division but is going to need more work
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
um for the Family Division um so that
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
that is something that we do try to do
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
because we have been onboarding sort of
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
one two three at a time it uh it has
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
been a little bit easier to specifically
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
structure the training to the the needs
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
of the individuals that are on boarding
 
00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
I think we have three that we just went
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
through um a Long training period with
 
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
and we were able to be a little bit
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
different because their backgrounds were
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit different and so the fact
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we're usually not taking on a large
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
number all at one time has made that
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
that there are exceptions to that but at
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
least at this moment they're sort of
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
coming in um 1 two three at a time we
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
get a little bit more of an opportunity
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
to really here are training to the
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
particular individuals that are coming
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
on board take good notes because our
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
hope is this will continue the next two
 
00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:37.830 align:start position:0%
hope is this will continue the next two
budget

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
Cycles uh Vice chair Smith I think you
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make some
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
comments I did want to thank you very
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
much for your comments and how
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
carefully attentive you were in terms of
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
how you you raised the issues that are
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
of some concern um
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh I I do want to comment on
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
one side comment that you made having to
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
do with your experience in
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
Washington and I would suggest you you
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
that over the
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
2 50 years or so there have been many
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
many times including recent times where
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
the legislative Branch uh both the the
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate um had very
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
positive relationships with the
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and with the
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
courts and um it is
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
only sometimes in the history of this
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
country that there has been
 
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.630 align:start position:0%
country that there has been
um

00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
where where each of the branches lost
 
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
sight of their common
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
purposes and um I want to make sure that
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we don't lose sight of
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
our common purposes without regard to
 
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.830 align:start position:0%
our common purposes without regard to
the

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
personalities of who at any specific
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
time is operating
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
any in any specific position so I thank
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
you very much for the care in which you
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
comments anyone else with a question or
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
a comment uh representative
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank you Mr
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
chair Atty krian to get your guidance uh
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
relative to the current status and what
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
is projected in the future uh based on
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
the report we have with Court rule 45
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
saying 2 years for additional
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
training are you in support of the bill
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's in finance right now stating that
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
the training would be completed within
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
three months of
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
hire um representative cutab was kind
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
enough to share the bill draft with me
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
before introduction and I did not
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
recommend any changes to her proposed
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
timelines which I know she researched I
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
believe she she reviewed other states
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
practices as well um so I I do not this
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
is a recommendation from the legislature
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
to the branch and we we receive it with
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
respect but we certainly have the
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
ability to implement that
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
um so it is it is not an inability to
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
implement the legislature's
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations in those areas the the
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
major issues that we had that are recent
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
relate to sort some sort of unusual
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
events including covid um where actually
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
we got a little bit of an opportunity to
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
do more training because some of the
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
cases were um not able to be heard it
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't it wasn't safe for folks to come
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
in right away uh so we sometimes might
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
take an opportunity like that and go
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
very very heavy in one year and you
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
might say the next year it doesn't need
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
to be quite as much because we utilize
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
that past opportunity so there are
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
certainly things that that happen that
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
adjust um what you might project in an
 
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
average year in an average onboarding
 
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
period but you know barring unusual
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
events we do try to train people within
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
that time period and we have um three
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges going through that
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
training I think they just completed
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
most of it um relatively quickly after
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
their um confirmation so I I think
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can Implement
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
and I um had the opportunity to consult
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
on that bill and did not um try to
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
adjust the time periods that she
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
recommended one followup Mr chair
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
followup U then relative to the bill
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
that you you have current currently
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
support on but notwithstanding any
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
adjustments to it is the three-month
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
timeline enough to complete the total
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum that's referenced in the
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
build in finance right now it is a
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
continuing curriculum um so it is it is
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing there's a continu education
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
requirement in addition to the initial
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
um it is not difficult to persuade
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
judges to engage in training um these
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
are people who voluntarily went to
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
school for 20 years and would probably
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
go back if they could um so the interest
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
is is there Judes love to do training I
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
know that there has been a little case
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
load stress um and I think also the
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion to have a Judicial training
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
coordinator is a good one I previously
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
um worked in a department that had a
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated Workforce uh training director
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
and the training that she was able to
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
procure and the work that she was able
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
to do persuading people to design new
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
trainings uh pers persuading people to
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
do free trainings going to experts and
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
and getting them to volunteer was
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
excellent it was the highest quality um
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
so I I do think that that suggestion is
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
a very good one that will lead to higher
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
quality training um but but we do have
 
00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
the ability to implement those
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements and
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
the initial training requirements one
 
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.870 align:start position:0%
the initial training requirements one
last

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
followup and specific to the
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
uh rep report that we have before
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
us was stating the Circuit Court judges
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
do not have clerks is that some is that
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
not something we should be addressing as
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
a legislature to reduce the workload
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
that would then would allow this type of
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
uh continuing training to be
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
facilitated that's a that's a great
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
question and a great observation uh I do
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
think that that has the potential to be
 
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
a force multiplier for our judges um
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
that being said there are of course many
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
demands at all times on the the the
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
resources of the state and we want to be
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
mindful that we don't balance those
 
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
competing concerns the legislature does
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
they decide where the where the money
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
will go for new hires and and things of
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
that nature um but would we use that
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
would that make judges more effective
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
would it potentially mean that someone
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
who is not whose time is not as
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
expensive as a Judicial officer is able
 
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
to displace some of the work that's
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
currently being done by a Judicial
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
officer I think ultimately there would
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
probably be some savings there and and
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
potentially we would not be as
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
restricted as we are um in the
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
constitutionally which we have to be and
 
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
how judges are chosen they have to go
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
through a process but um if we needed to
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
we could hire more um it's not the same
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
lifetime commitment that that choosing a
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
Judicial officer is that has to be done
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
more carefully and only based on what we
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
know our needs will be for a long long
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
time um so I think that that's a very
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
sharp observation and something that
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
would make judges more effective thank
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
you Attorney K thank you Mr chair along
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
that line um in the medical part of The
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
Healing Center that I look after we have
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
doctors nurse practitioners and medical
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
assistants there was a week with a
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
Ultimate Storm of things coming together
 
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
where we had no nurse practitioners and
 
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
no medical assistants doctors were
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
putting patients into the room doctors
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
were doing all the things and the work
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
slowed way down and I'm thinking law is
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
not much different in terms of who's
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
backstopping the ones on the bench and
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
if there are um clerks and uh attorneys
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
backing up the judges it can get a lot
 
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
more work done and with less expense
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
than just just naming more judges
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
although we need to do that too so yeah
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
this is to be encouraged this needs to
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
be in the next um plea at budget time I
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
think um having been told on several
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
occasions by more than one from the
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that as the reports
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations are
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
implemented and the Judiciary welcomes
 
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.029 align:start position:0%
implemented and the Judiciary welcomes
our

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%

70 now the third and final topic we have
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
is the speaker asked if once this was
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
all put together and if you would be so
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
kind as to give me what we already have
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll take this and I'll do some
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
editing and rewriting and and so on and
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
then get back to you okay
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
um the speaker asked would we now
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
adjourn the
 
00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.829 align:start position:0%
adjourn the
committee

00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
and I thought what if something of a
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
real hot button nature comes up over the
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
summer and we are now the ones who think
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
why didn't we see that but here it is
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
well we've just adjourned too late 10
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
years from now there's another special
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee or Mr Speaker we keep this
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
open until end of October and perhaps
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
decide this is a topic we want to
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
address name a subcommittee to go to
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
work on then reconvene this and that
 
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee report we discuss to see if
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
it'll be in the final report and he said
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
sure keep it open so we are open and
 
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
I've handed notes or sent email to
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
various ones uh asking what do you think
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
might be a worthy topic for our
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
consideration now there's a number of
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
topics that can be suggested that are
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
very good but I do not see they fall
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
within the perview of the special
 
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
committee but there may be some which do
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
and this is is from representative Erica
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
Leon my former Vice chair when I chaired
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services she said I
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
have heard numerous complaints that
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
unless there are broken
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
bones assault on a child and domestic
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
addressed in reviewing the statutes
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
district court has jurisdiction to
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
arraign defendants charged with felony
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
offenses and the a preliminary
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
examination to determine whether the
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
probable cause exists to believe the
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
offense was committed and the defendant
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
committed the offense and if so to be
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
bound over to the superior court for
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
further proceedings this is she says in
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 490
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
DF colon
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
3-a and she adds I would like to
 
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
understand what currently happens when a
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
child is physically or sexually
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
assaulted if there are already specific
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines on how the reports are
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
handled at
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
DCF uh that would be helpful uh is there
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
a likely intersection between dcyf and
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
the courts on this uh what might the
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
special committee choose to do on this
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
topic and I'm not stipulating to any of
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
the facts I've quoted I've just read a
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
report and I want to throw this out to
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
any member of the uh special committee
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
and also to attorney
 
00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:35.390 align:start position:0%
and also to attorney
craigan

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
craigan
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative Kap I think it's
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
definitely something worth looking into
 
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.230 align:start position:0%
definitely something worth looking into
I

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
think on a similar note we had also
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
discuss potentially looking into
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
domestic violence but I think because
 
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
they become Hot
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
Topics it becomes a
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
quick point of contention where people
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
are like oh we're not let's not look
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
into that but I doesn't mean that it's
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
any less important to look into I think
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
we we have these issues going on and I
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we potentially
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
do take some time to look into them and
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
I wonder if it could be
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
a potentially like an intersection of
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
looking into both abuse but also the DV
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
issue as well like if it could kind of
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
be a combined issue to look into both of
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
them because I do think that that that
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
is something that we continually heard
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
issues on
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
and I I feel like for DV it was a
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
similar situation where
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
some judges were giving orders where
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
people felt like they shouldn't have
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
been given but then on the extreme side
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
there was also some orders being given
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
where or some orders not being given
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
where people were like hey this
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely should have be given I mean
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
think the Lindsay Smith's C case and so
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
it seems like um there may be a similar
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
issue with abuse
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
where it's not kind of properly being
 
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
addressed and I wonder if this might be
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
an issue that we could take a look at
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
together might it be something that
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
internally Judiciary might wish to take
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
a private look at uh not necessarily
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
disposing of what's before us but at
 
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
least beforehand because it may be the
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
case that as you examine how this has
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
been hand handle you may see there's a
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
few judges that go way overboard on
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
giving orders and a few judges that
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't seem to do anything else and if
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
that is the case that is continuing
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
education individually some things can
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
be and should be handled that way before
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
they're handled more publicly at least
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
that much uh just a suggestion an answer
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:51.069 align:start position:0%
is not
needed

00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
what are completely different and conent
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
right so work when it comes to
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
deal only thatview outside of the
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
criminal it's taking a look at it to see
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
if somebody else may Pi up the ball as
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
long as that
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
job we're looking at
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
that otherwise we are going to happen
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
anything that
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
happens charge cannot be
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman um one thing I
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
will say on the work of the special
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
committee on DCF is that I understand at
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
least at this moment that they're going
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
to start I think with the investigative
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
process that dcyf follows and I think
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
they're inviting the chiefs of police
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
and some others um the court does have a
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
role in the investigative process it is
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
a little more limited um you know by
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
statute on a probable cause finding we
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
can issue orders that for example allow
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
an interview of a child um so there
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
there are laws that the legislature has
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
passed that involve the court in some of
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
those early steps
 
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
um a very good kind of compendium of the
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
Court's role in abuse and neglect cases
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
is our our protocols um which are
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
available online and I'm happy to send a
 
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
a link to the researcher as well um that
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
just lays out the existing law that we
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
follow in investigative process and
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
different types of cases um certainly
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature can can make adjustments
 
00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:21.079 align:start position:0%
in these areas but um I think the
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
investigative we have a little bit lower
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
of a role and I think that may be where
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
the committee is starting and then
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
eventually they will go through
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
potentially at a later time the court uh
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
process as well with abuses neglect
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
cases representative Leon who gave me
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
that piece I just read is now the chair
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
of the special committee on
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
DCF and when the email was followed up
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
with a phone call it was uh on the order
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
of the handoff from our perspective
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
Family Court what more should we ask for
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
look at whatever before then it becomes
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
a a matter of superior court and
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
different rules and different judges and
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
so on I think that's what she was
 
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
looking for is where is that connection
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
from us to her and I think there's
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
there's some Connection in the um the
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect protocols um between
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
work that's done in the on our side in
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
the court side and then work's done in
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
the dcyf side because they do have to
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
interact with us for permission in a
 
00:42:23.069 --> 00:42:23.079 align:start position:0%
number of areas um and that's probably
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
the best guide for anyone that wants to
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
learn more about what we're currently
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
do representative Vice chair Smith thank
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
you um I'm interested also in the
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
difference between um the Civil
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
component and the
 
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.309 align:start position:0%
component and the
criminal

00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
component and um I
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
myself uh would speaking only for myself
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
would be fearful of anything that we
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
might do that
 
00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:03.069 align:start position:0%
might do that
unintentionally

00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:03.079 align:start position:0%
unintentionally
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
blurs the separation between civil and
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
criminal particularly in terms of
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
um considered I I'm I'm picking my words
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
carefully here but because it's
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
certainly I don't want to say who are
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
charged because then we're off into a
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
different game um and I'm not
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
sure that this is the
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
place to do that and while I completely
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
sympathize with representative Leo
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
wanting to um find another little perch
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
for some of the enormous resp
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities she has I'm not sure
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
place I I could not comment on on that
 
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.870 align:start position:0%
place I I could not comment on on that
ma'am

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
ma'am
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature has set um a lot of
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
guidance to the courts already in terms
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
of how to pursue an abuse and neglect
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
case the legislature can certainly
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
adjust um those standards um there are
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
competing concerns there there are the
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
rights of children there are the rights
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
of parents um the primary focus in a
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
criminal case is on the rights of the
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
defendant um the the primary focus in a
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
civil case is on the burden to the
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
plaintiff um and vindicating their
 
00:44:43.549 --> 00:44:43.559 align:start position:0%
rights these are different frames um and
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
not everything is always handled the
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
same way by different states but I think
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
you do generally find that Most states
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
in abuse and neglect case the the
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
primary consideration is the best
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
interest of the child and that's it it
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
may be that all 50 states are identical
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
in that standard I have to do more
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
research but I think you that is a a
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
standard if it is the rights of the
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
child for abuse and neglect are we
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
separating abuse and neglect versus
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
physical sexual harm as two different
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
spheres one is civil the other is
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
Criminal is that where the line
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
is the standards are different uh in an
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect case the primary issue
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
is what will what will happen to the
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
child next where will they be if if you
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
look at a criminal case um if the very
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
high burden of of um of proof is not met
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
then you default back to the situation
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
which existed before the case was
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
initiated if a defendant is not
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
convicted then they move about their
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
life as normal uh in an abuse neglect
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
case I think that would leave a question
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
about what happens next with the child
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what the disposition of
 
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
the parent is uh so abuse neglect is
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
focused on what is
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
next and what is best for the child the
 
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:01.559 align:start position:0%
criminal Cas is um either a very high
 
00:46:03.069 --> 00:46:03.079 align:start position:0%
standard is met in which case a
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
potentially a very severe sanction is
 
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
imposed or it's not in which case no
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
sanction is imposed and no change to the
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
status quo occurs um just to clarify my
 
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
previous question is that roughly the
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
dividing line between civil and Criminal
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
Court there are others for different
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
case types but I would say in this
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
context yes generally for the liberal
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
arts guy yeah thank you yes repres PE um
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
I just had a question thank you for
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
answering and being here appreciate your
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
time um one of the things that came
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
forward in the testimony um was that if
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
people were
 
00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:41.079 align:start position:0%
found not guilty in a criminal
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
court the concern was that then when it
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
came back to the family court where you
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
said that if they're found not guilty
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
they go on with their life but in
 
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:50.559 align:start position:0%
actuality they don't because then they
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
go back to Family Court who says well we
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't really care what Criminal Court
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
says because this is what we think so
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
we're still not going to get your
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
children and so you it's almost it's not
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
a double jeopardy but it's it's you're
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
still being penalized for something that
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
you were found not guilty of um so that
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
was the one that was the one case the
 
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
one person who came to testify and
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's what he was um saying so I I
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question and that does
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
happen that that the same set of facts
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
will be the subject of both a sim a
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
criminal and a civil case in which case
 
00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:23.079 align:start position:0%
the fact that the cases have different
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
burdens um you know the very very high
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt standard for criminal
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
and the lower preponderance of the
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
evidence clear and convincing evidence
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
standard for the civil case will result
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
that the very high burden of the
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
criminal case is not met but the the
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
still greater than 50% but not
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable Dow standard is met in the
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
civil case um so that that does happen I
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
think uh it's not uncommon for example
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
that a victim is not Vindicated in a
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
criminal case and then they sue the
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
defendant and they do obtain a result in
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
a civil case because the burden is lower
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
um so so that is not an unusual result
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
um Double Jeopardy explicitly bars a
 
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
criminal sanction imposed by the same
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
Sovereign uh right and I I I I
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
understand that but it almost is even
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
though you're going to a different
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to get the same result of
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
losing your children and I'm not saying
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
I'm on either side of that I'm just
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
asking I appreciate you explaining that
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify that that can happen
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
ma'am it can be that someone is not
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
convicted in a criminal case and yet
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
they do face a a civil they have the
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
same penalty regardless it should not be
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
the same it should not be typically a
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
civil sanction is not intended to be
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
punitive uh it's intended to vindicate
 
00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
the rights of the the plaintiff or the
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
focus of the case so the plaintiff has
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
lost money in a civil case and they sue
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
to regain that money it can be punitive
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
if it's determined to be by Statute for
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
example punitive damages can be in a
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
civil statute but uh it's typically to
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
vindicate the rights of another person
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
as opposed to to um incapacitate or
 
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
retribute against a criminal defendant
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
just for a quick follow up so just for a
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
clarification so again we're going back
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
to that it's not supposed to be punitive
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
and and all that but take denying the
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
the parent their child is punitive so
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's where I think we're having this
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
real big that gray area that's where the
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
struggle is I think in the family court
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
and amongst the people who came to
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
testify as to how do we Rectify that
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
situation um and I think that's the real
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
the real sticky part of this whole um
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
thing and it it may well require that we
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
do more investigation into that area to
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
find out how do we how do we move
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
forward to make sure that someone
 
00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.430 align:start position:0%
forward to make sure that someone
um

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
isn't um denied their children
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
unjustly that's a very tough balance a
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
lot of these laws you're looking at
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
different parties and their interests
 
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
and how you balance um their rights and
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very uh difficult job and
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
not every state has done it the exact
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
same way um they are a little different
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
from state to state um
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's certainly a challenging
 
00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
question I think you do often see that
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes the state will try an approach
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
move back to a previous approach um
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
because it's so difficult to get that
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
that balance exactly right and I I don't
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
envy the the task that you have thank
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
you very much we've got just a few
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
minutes left in case there's anything
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
additional representative ball for
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
something additional thank you chairman
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
Pearson um so the only thing would bring
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
up is another thing that we might want
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about if we were to reconvene is
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
after the bills go through that we have
 
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
kind of um sponsored to get forward um
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
if they do not pass and they are not
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor that we may want
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
to come back and look at why these bills
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
may not have um gone forward and what we
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
can do to kind of go back to square one
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
and and see if there are any changes we
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.309 align:start position:0%
 
make

00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
if anyone on the special committee
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
has further ideas please send them to me
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
in an email and if you want to flesh
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
them out with some commentary and even
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
make suggestions as to who might be
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
interested in this subcommittee uh in
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
this Committee in serving on a
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee please do so and uh we've
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
got some time to do it excellent
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
excellent suggestion representative
 
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
ball with
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
that I adjourn the meeting of the
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
special committee and uh see you
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
sometime and thank you so much again for
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
coming Mr chair and speaking I'm sure
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
from my colleagues I would like to thank
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
you for your leadership on on this
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
committee which was not easy and um I
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
think we've made some progress all B

00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
foster care system Prime sponsor Senator

00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
first rule of testifying before this

committee turn the mic on thank you
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and good morning Mr
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee um my
 
01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
name is Shannon chandley and I serve the
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
people of marac Wilton Milford and
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
Amherst in District 11 in the Senate um
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
I come before you today to introduce
 
01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
566 as the chair said it is to establish
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
a committee to study foster care
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
families and the foster care system so
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
um I have served several terms in the
 
01:00:34.029 --> 01:00:34.039 align:start position:0%
house and I'm in my second term in the
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
Senate and and throughout um my tenure I
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
have received calls from constituents
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
who have concerns about the foster care
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
system um you know these concerns um
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes people are quite desperate I'm
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
sure you've heard some of the um the
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
concerns that the folks have raised to
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
me here in your committee um they are
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
include they include um uh uh certainly
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
a lack of uh placements for foster
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
children um discrepancies between kin
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
and non-kin fostering uh requirements of
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
the Foster family and the living space
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
so this bill was a way of trying to um
 
01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
look at the entire issue in one setting
 
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
for a while I tried to come up with um
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
certain ways to maybe uh how can we and
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
for lack of the better term I'll use the
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
word fix the system but I think that
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily A system that is
 
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
broken it is a system that needs to be
 
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:43.039 align:start position:0%
um looked at so problems identified
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
challenges identified and solutions
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
created and I think that a study
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee might be the best place to do
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
that um I've reached out to various
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
shareholder uh stakeholders advocates
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
and um members of the legislature who
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
are expert in this area and that
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
certainly includes um your chair and
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
honorable members of this committee and
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
I widespread support for doing this I
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
considered that there are there have
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
been um foster care subcommittees in the
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh oversight committee on
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
DHHS and there are other committees that
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees that look at
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
Children's Services but in con in um
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
consultation with a number of people
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
with expertise in the area seemed like
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
this might be the best way to move
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
forward um the bill is very simple it
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
sets up your standard uh study committee
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
and I know many of us are loathed to uh
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
put forward more study committees where
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
issues are extremely important we need
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
to do that and um the charge is uh to
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
assess the regulations and requirements
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
to qualify as a foster parent um um the
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
special circumstances of foster care
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
provided by relatives and how to best
 
01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
provide guidance to recruit and CA uh
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
and maintain um potential Foster
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
families um it's not limited to that and
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
the the committee as it does its work
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
May find other areas where there are
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
issues and identify those as um needing
 
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
Solutions so with that I ask you to look
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
favorably upon sb56 6 and um happy to
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
take any questions if you have any thank
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
you before I turn them loose I'm just
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
noticing the allstar cast of House
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
members you have as
 
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors Greg Pearson patrino sidal
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
wow it is it is I said that I could I
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
reached out to folks with a real if not
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
expertise working knowledge of these
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
issues and certainly the members of this
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
committee are those folks as my father
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
often said don't your shoulder out by
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
excessively patting yourself on the back
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
any questions for the
 
01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
senator representative
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question fabulous Bill
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
I just have one quick question
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
um on line8 it says the members of the
 
01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
committee shall receive mileage at the
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislative rate is there a reason to
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
not include federal rate I'm just
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
thinking of the accounting nightmare for
 
01:04:25.559 --> 01:04:26.589 align:start position:0%
thinking of the accounting nightmare for
the

01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
same it is not no it's not so if that is
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely not a problem to address it
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the members of the
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
committee who would be eligible for that
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
rate I think it's worth
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
um does anyone know the difference so
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
I I know there is the state rate and the
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
federal rate but I did not I I assume
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
both were um encompassed in legislative
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
rate but that I I am absolutely willing
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
to change that to accommodate the
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
federal rate is not um included in your
 
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
income tax on your
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
1040 we can elect as I
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
recall the federal rate or or the
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislative rate legislative rate
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
becomes income I signed off saying I
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
wanted the federal rate and that is how
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
I've been paid for8 years
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the reason I ask I
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
can't imagine
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
that this person gets the federal rate
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their legislative rates
 
01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
while we have the senator here um
 
01:05:40.589 --> 01:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could move past our own
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
wallets and ask her any questions about
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Raymond thank you
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
Mr uh chairman and thank you for taking
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
my question sure so this is only my
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
first term in the house and so I don't
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
have uh a huge familiarity with study
 
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
committees so when a committee like this
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
is formed do you also investigate how
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
other states potentially are doing
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
foster care and if there's things that
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
we can learn from them or is it only
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
kind of a review of our internal systems
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
it would Encompass both because it
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
really is at the um the chair will the
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
committee will be established and the
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
chair is able to run the committee as um
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
the chair sees fit and I think that
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
given C certainly within the parameters
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
outlined in the bill the uh chair may
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
decide that the way to do this is to
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
call in some of um the people from the
 
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
state and from the other agencies with
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
whom the state contracts to understand
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
what the situation is the there may also
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
be um people who have some concerns or
 
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
complaints who want to come and address
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh raise those issues before the
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
committee and in terms of seeking
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
Solutions looking at other states is one
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
of the potential ways to find
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
Solutions do you have a candidate from
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
the senate in mind who might like to
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
chair this committee um there are
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
several able and willing folks and um I
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
would certainly um be happy to do so but
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm defer to um the Senate
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
president's appointment you have good
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
Senators on this too okay anyone
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
else representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
chairman Senator chandley uh just wanted
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
to ask uh in um for preface my question
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
is in optimizing the performance level
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee to be
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
appointed the starting point being has
 
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
there been an audit done of the foster
 
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
care system in in the state of New
 
01:07:53.789 --> 01:07:53.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know I would think that
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
would something be something that would
 
01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
have to be looked into I don't know how
 
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
recently that has been done one follow
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
up Mr chairman follow up and then uh
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
because the with with the goal of
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
getting this done while we're young
 
01:08:09.789 --> 01:08:09.799 align:start position:0%
because this is a very important issue
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh would would you be aware though of
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
any highlights of um subject matters
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
that would be prevalent as issue one and
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
two for the committee to address so I
 
01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
think issue one is pro and of course
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
again this is subjective but issue one
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
may well be um how do we make sure that
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
we have enough foster care parents
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
available and issue number two is what
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
do we do to train and um and guide them
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
in their role as foster parents um and
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'll I'll make that issue
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
number one those two things are issue
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
number one and issue number two would be
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
what are the barriers why do people not
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
serve or why do they back away from
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
serving so a fiscal no would be a
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
reality in in this
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
work a any any solutions that would be
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
proposed through legislation would
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
likely have a fiscal note but I'm not
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
sure of that thank you Senator welcome
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%

as the last bill you heard but it is
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
quality uh the office of child advocate
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
this issue to Senator Ward uh in the
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
fall after conducting an in-depth

investigation into incidents of severe
 
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
child abuse where a number of infants
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
were not adequately protected in the
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
welfare system due in part to the
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
inability of DCF medical providers and
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to timely and
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
effectively share
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%

01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 572 a bill that establishes
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
a commission to study the sharing of
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
confidential records between law
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement the medical community child
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
protection services and the legal
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
Community this problem implicates a
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
number of state and federal statutes as
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
well as policies and procedures across
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
these three sectors the commission will
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
study the relevant laws the barriers to
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
information sharing in this Arena of
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary teams to investigate
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
child abuse and how to prevent such
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
roadblocks since many agencies are
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
involved in the work uh we need to
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
safeguard the sharing of information so
 
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
our children are protected while their
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
privacy is also protected I want to
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Ward thanks you for
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
your consideration and support of Senate
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 572 I would defer questions to some
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
of the Advocates we have here and if
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
there's anything they can't answer I can
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
get your questions to Senator Ward and
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
for take my question um so what we've
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
got is a few U entities that can't share
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
information with each other right like
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
hipper is a a problem for you right yeah
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
there there are privacy conc concerns
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
with both medical and law enforcement
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
they have their own standards and
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
getting through those silos so people
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
can know when children are at risk is
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
the challenge and hipper is a federal
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
law isn't it it is and so now what about
 
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement one uh well there
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
are various uh privacy concerns when
 
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a an
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
investigation so state and federal laws
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
this is what the commission would would
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
do is look at all the relevant laws that
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
you need to comply with to see how how
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
can how can we share information without
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
breaking either state or federal law the
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
multidisiplinary followup yeah thank you
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman the multidisciplinary uh
 
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
thing is about uh professional people uh
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
getting together that are involved in
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
the child's issues right correct um and
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
they they've been doing that for some
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
years now and so how have they worked
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
in the past without this with the
 
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
problem of this federal law and uh and
 
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
police now police
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
are um can't share like
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice things criminal okay
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
and is there something else
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
about police can't share well that
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
getting in any specific cases that have
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
happened in the past Senator Ward saw
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
specific instances where children were
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
at risk and the right people weren't
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
able to tell the other people uh what
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
they knew so that they might be able to
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
prevent a tragedy this is what the the
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of the commission would be is to
 
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
find out where there might be gaps in
 
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.270 align:start position:0%
find out where there might be gaps in
the

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
system is your follow up is are there
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
any other entities besides those two
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
entities that have a a non-communication
 
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
issue well I think you'll see if you
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
look at the text of the bill there are a
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
number of stakeholders that are included
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
and I think uh you've got the courts
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
you've got the office of child advocate
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
DCF um the house and the Senate and um
 
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Hospital friction points
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for the yeah I I think
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
that's something the commission would be
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
involved in in fleshing out and and
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
finding I I couldn't tell myself the
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
only two okay yeah thank
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
you anything
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
further seeing nothing thank you so much
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and if the senator could uh be
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
in touch with me uh a little bit later
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
on when the names of the committee will
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
be put together I appreciate that thank
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you chair recognizes um I
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
think I get it right Amy Roy or
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's oh there we go okay good
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
morning uh my name is Dr Amy Roy I am a
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
pediatric emergency medicine doctor uh
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
with the Elliott hospital and then I
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
of sorry um I also conduct specialized
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
medical exams for the child protection
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
programs both with the Elliot and at
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um I've been in that role I
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
think for about seven or eight years now
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
and uh certainly have encountered over
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
that time lots of issues with sharing of
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
information um as these
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
multidisciplinary teams have sort of uh
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
taken root in New Hampshire you know I
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
think we in the medical community
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
certainly recognize them as really being
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
an invaluable tool for child protection
 
01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
these provide uh a really critical and a
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
unique opportunity for um dialogue
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
between medical community child
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
protective services between law
 
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement sometimes other stakeholders
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
such as mental health and uh may serve
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
when we are able to come together and
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
have the kind of dialogue that we need
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
to have as an opportunity to really sort
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
of solidify and crystallize in uh in in
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
the sort of minds of those agencies that
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
there is significant reason for concern
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
for abuse and a real need to move
 
01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
forward expeditiously um equally
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
importantly and I actually have a good
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
example of this uh sometimes what comes
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
out of these Medical out of these
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team meetings is an
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
equally important opportunity to resolve
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
a concern for abuse so that a family may
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
really be able to put that episode
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
behind them and to um and to move
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
forward uh a recurring stumbling block
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
as we've already heard referenced here
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
is um the capacity to share information
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
and certainly amongst the medical
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
community um a pervasive concern is
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hippa fear of a HIPPA violation
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
and the difficulty that most routine
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
medical providers have in really
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
understanding the nuances of HIPPA which
 
01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:05.719 align:start position:0%
is a big complex piece of federal
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and in knowing where there
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
are in fact protections and
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities to share information um
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
certainly it's hard to believe that the
 
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
intention of HIPPA is to prevent the
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
sharing of information that is really
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
gerine to um to Children's Health but we
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh certainly need help in understanding
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
how to communicate that what the sort of
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
guardrails are and how to function
 
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
effectively but also legally within that
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team um setting I
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
think it's also important to remember
 
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
you know when we look at who is signing
 
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
consents to release information you know
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
in many of these instances a parent may
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
also be a perpetrator and that can be a
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
little bit complicated um so I think I
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
can say with real confidence that the
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
medical community would uh urge and
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
embrace the passing of this bill so that
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
we can have some clarity that would
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
allow us to um make these teams the
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
effective tool that we know that they
 
01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
effective tool that we know that they
can

01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
be and I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
if there are any any questions
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair long thank you
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for your
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the testimony that we get
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
here often is medical uh
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
because if you have medical information
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
at the school district for example
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's not their medical in
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
information um it's your medical
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
information uh now my understanding
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
medically is I don't know about four
 
01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
years ago or
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
sooner um if the entity was
 
01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.709 align:start position:0%
sooner um if the entity was
under

01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
um uh if they if they were held to the
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
same uh confidential ity requirements
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
then it could be passed is is that still
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
the understanding I'm not sure I
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
understand that completely well it was
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
mostly on when we were looking at uh
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
doing um video uh medical appointments
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
but via vid video okay uh the passing
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
the passing we we looked at the passing
 
01:22:16.239 --> 01:22:17.110 align:start position:0%
the passing we we looked at the passing
of

01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
information um so that the other entity
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to start from the
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
beginning um and we found out that if
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're beholden to
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
confidentiality then that information
 
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
can be passed to them are you familiar
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
with any changes of that sort no I feel
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
like I might not be the best person for
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
this question but I think you know
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
between when there's sharing information
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
between medical providers who are really
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
operating under that same framework then
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
yes that is allowed um and beyond that I
 
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe so but I may not the
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
person to ask okay all right thank you
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
any further
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you J recognizes Lisa masio and

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone Lissa masio I am
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
the associate child advocate and with me
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
is Jennifer Jones one of our assistant
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
child Advocates I feel like I haven't
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
seen you all for a while you're we've
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
missed you too I've missed
 
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
you uh so we are here um as uh Senator
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
Ward's representative said uh this bill
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
was born of an issue that the office dis
 
01:23:58.750 --> 01:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
discovered um last springish into the
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
fall um as you know we are an
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
independent oversight agency overseeing
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
All State serving
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
agencies um and we support this bill
 
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
obviously as we helped write it we
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
worked closely with Senators Carson and
 
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:13.639 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley and the oversight
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
commission for children's services
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
around this issue um to increase
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
protection for vulnerable children and
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
this piece of uh legislation is kind of
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
central to that work in increasing
 
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
communication um around members of the
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
multidisciplinary team so I'm going to
 
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
let um Miss Jones here talk about the
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
process that this bill was born of a
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
little bit and the specific players to
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that have
 
01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:44.030 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that have
been

01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
asked good morning lovely to be here
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
with you all I feel like I haven't seen
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
this Committee in some time myself so
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
it's nice to be back um so I I want to
 
01:24:56.109 --> 01:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
talk a bit
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
about kind of getting down to the
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
technical pieces of what a
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
multidisciplinary team does and um why
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's so important that a
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team is able to
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
collaborate so when there is an
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
investigation concerning child abuse and
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
or neglect um particularly with
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
reference to the investigation that
 
01:25:20.669 --> 01:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate conducted
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
um as Lisa mentioned um last year um we
 
01:25:27.109 --> 01:25:27.119 align:start position:0%
took to look at approximately nine cases
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
where there were serious bodily injury
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
to 11 non-ambulatory infants so when
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a case like that
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be law
 
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement in dcyf so your stage Child
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
Protection collaboration that's a co-
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
investigation because we're not only
 
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
looking at child safety but we're
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
looking at potential uh a criminal
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
aspect we know small infants can't
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
injure themselves um in the way that
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
they were injured in these cases that we
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
we had um been uh our office had been
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
referred to so as we took a deep dive
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
into the communication so there were two
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
aspects to it we took a deep dive into
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
reviewing the records for each of these
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
individual cases meaning we were looking
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
at the communication between all members
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
of the multi-disciplinary team so that
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
includes law enforcement Child
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
Protection uh
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
prosecution excuse me as Dr Roy
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned sometimes that includes other
 
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
entities um like your non- investigative
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
collaborative team members like uh
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
crisis centers mental health and so we
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
were looking at again the communication
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
between those uh entities and how they
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
were collaborating as an investigative
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
team and we also did a system mapping
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
review so that we could look at human
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
factors right things that were barriers
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
um or things that may have occurred or
 
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
happened um just in decision day-to-day
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
decision- making of those investigators
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
as well as system barriers so we largely
 
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
found that in almost all of those cases
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
there was a breakdown in communication
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
at some point in time um that could have
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
been in the onset where law enforcement
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
was responding and asking questions and
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
getting information without the presence
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
of DCF or um quite the opposite where
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
CPS was out responding in the immediate
 
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement hadn't been looped
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
in just yet and so those investigations
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of moving parts so it's
 
01:27:22.109 --> 01:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
not just about the child or infant being
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
seen in the immediate in the medical
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
information that may come out of that
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
one time appointment or that one time um
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know referral to the Ed or um you
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
know there's there's lab work there's um
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up skeletal surveys that may
 
01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
uncover or identify additional injuries
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
that didn't exist at the time of the
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
first initial examination and so what
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
happens is um in the respective
 
01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
investigations as that information
 
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
continues to present itself so as you
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
know you can imagine it takes some time
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
for lab work to get back it takes
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
approximately two weeks for a skeletal
 
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
survey to occur if the investigative
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
agencies are getting that
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
information at different times and not
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
able to share it creates a real
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
disadvantage about what one another
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
knows about their investigation and how
 
01:28:12.719 --> 01:28:13.910 align:start position:0%
knows about their investigation and how
they're

01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
collaborating um and so we found it
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
imperative um to have this um study
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
commission to really get get to some of
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know representative bigford had some
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
great questions um along with
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative long about like how does
 
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
that work how can you do that in a
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
legally defensible way and that's why we
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
want this study commission so what does
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
it look like when there's medical issues
 
01:28:43.149 --> 01:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
right but they're specific to child
 
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
abuse and what and how do we pursue
 
01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.390 align:start position:0%
abuse and what and how do we pursue
those

01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
investigations while honoring the
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
Privacy that all people are entitled to
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
medically but understanding that this
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
isn't you know this isn't just calling
 
01:28:59.470 --> 01:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
up and inquiring about somebody's you
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
know average visit to their primary care
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
physician this is a child abuse
 
01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
investigation and safety is Paramount so
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
what does that look like and how can we
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
navigate it in a way that um we're
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
really not running into um one
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
investigative agency having information
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
the other doesn't um as you can imagine
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
a collaborative investigation requires
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
good communication and timely
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
communication another um issue that we
 
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
were able to um elicit from our system
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
mapping is that this also um sort of in
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
the long game when these things go to
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
trial if dcyf and or law enforcement
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the Child's full medical
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
record and they don't have all the
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
records in their Discovery medical
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
professionals can't speak to it at trial
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
as expert Witnesses and that really
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
really can impede the judge's ability to
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
assess safety in a way that they have
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
all of the facts and so there's a lot of
 
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's a really multifaceted issue and
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
that's why we are fully in support of
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
the study commission um thank you so
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
much for your time I'm happy to answer
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
any questions oh sorry did you have more
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
all I you can either ask questions or I
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
can tell you more and then you can ask
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
both of us questions up to you
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
sir I'll I pick B okay I'll keep going
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
so um as Jen said it it is a very
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
complex area rather than us just try and
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
write a bill that would somehow cover
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
Hippa and law enforcement and dcyf the
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
study commission will help because some
 
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
of the specific barriers we were seeing
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
is it does appear under the current laws
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
and I I did attach you I know we all
 
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
like appendices appendix a which is a
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
compilation of all the relevant
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
rsas it is clear from those read
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
together that the legislature intends
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
for these multi disciplinary teams to be
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
able to communicate however
 
01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are some gaps some
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
of these statutes require rulemaking
 
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
which just never occurred so that's a
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
gap some of them just sort of become
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
circular in logic so for example DCF
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
gets medical records and they get law
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement records however they
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
currently read their confidentiality
 
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
statute to mean they can only disclose
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
their records I things they created
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
their case notes not even to include the
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
cap exam that they paid for and sent the
 
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
child too so there's this this like
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
chicken in the egg problem that DCF now
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
has a lot of records and can't share it
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
with anybody else they can't give law
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement the cap exam they can't tell
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
medical what's happening um so that's um
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
a gap that needs to be solved however we
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to just sort of infringe a
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
solution on them we wanted the players
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
to come to the table and say how can we
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
overcome that similarly law enforcement
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
especially during an active
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
investigation against a parent of one of
 
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.229 align:start position:0%
investigation against a parent of one of
these

01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
children don't necessarily want to share
 
01:32:09.629 --> 01:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
notes about an active investigation
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
because if they give it to dcyf because
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
this is a court case they're required to
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
disclose it in Discovery so now you're
 
01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
actually giving records to the
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
perpetrator so it's it's a complicated
 
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
issue in that mapping all of the parties
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
said we really want to fix this we
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
really want to be able to talk to each
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
other but these are all complicated
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
issues we need to sit down at a table
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
and figure out what to do uh that
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
mapping did also discover another Gap um
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
at the court that some of the current
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
laws around abuse and neglect RSA 169
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
see the definitions are being
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
interpreted in a way to require a much
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
higher standard than necessary so we do
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
have another bill I believe you're
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
hearing soon uh when it comes over SB
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
459 addresses that issue so we're trying
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
to kind of address the discrete issues
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
and allow this multi-disciplinary team
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
which the legislature created but now
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
execution now you get to ask questions
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.109 --> 01:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's Vice chairman long
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony um I mean this is
 
01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
probably going to put a stick in the
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
wheel uh but we hear several testimony
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh of parents being left out of the loop
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
I you know I I understand there are some
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
things you want to keep from them if
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
they are the ones being investigated but
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
we're off often hearing that even if the
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
court or somebody deems uh that it
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't at that level they're still not
 
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
hearing that and and um the child is
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
still either being kept from them or so
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if
 
01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's I mean I get this information um
 
01:34:09.119 --> 01:34:10.510 align:start position:0%
that's I mean I get this information um
confidential

01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
sharing um but also if parents could be
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
even a parent that's not
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
um um that's not uh being investigated
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
for abuse uh they're not getting the
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
information um so they don't know what's
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
happening with their child they don't
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
know what one entity or another entity
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's law enforcement
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
DCF uh whomever um so I I I think that
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
would be I I think it would be helpful
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
knowing where the gaps are and with the
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
parents uh we know what we want to keep
 
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
from whomever is being investigated I
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
get that uh but my understand through um
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
testimony uh from parents is that
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
they're not getting investigated however
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
they still can't get any information
 
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
about their child so this Bill thank you
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
for the question and I hear what you're
 
01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
saying because we've we've heard similar
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
things frankly parents call our office
 
01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
saying I can't figure out what's going
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
on um this particular Bill send them to
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
you feel free um this particular bill
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
has to do with the professional
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
multidisciplinary team which is created
 
01:35:24.669 --> 01:35:24.679 align:start position:0%
under statute already it is only
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
professionals sharing information about
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
an ongoing open child abuse case under
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
some of the statutes though that I
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
included in this appendix though RSA 170
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
g8a is dcf's confidentiality statute
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
which is very clear that a parent who is
 
01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.350 align:start position:0%
which is very clear that a parent who is
under

01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
investigation is allowed to get in
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
information about their case unless the
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
department determines that disclosing to
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
that parent likely if they are a
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
potential perpetrator would um the harm
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
to the child would be outweighed so
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's within the statute it's also
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
within um again sometimes there have
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
been administrative rules that should be
 
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
made that haven't been made or maybe are
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
outdated um but parents receiving
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
information I think would be a separate
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
issue that a parent would need to deal
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
with with these separate entities law
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement has rules around who's
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to see an ongoing investigation
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
which is usually nobody and then Hippa
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
as Dr Roy mentioned it is actually
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
usually the parent that holds all the
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
control in a hipa situation as far as
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
giving consent which again in this case
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
if the parent is the perpetrator
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
allowing them to refuse to disclose that
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
child's medical records can actually
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
really endanger that child um but
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
parents getting information is actually
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
part of some of these statutes and is
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
separate from this particular
 
01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team just because of
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
the way it was established in statute
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
you sing no more cards on this Bill
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
what oh I'm
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
sorry representative McMahon sorry no no
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's fine you're multi asking as
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
always Mr chairman don't worry about it
 
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
I just have a question for see it's
 
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
moving up I used to miss representative
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
Raymond and I got that one solved and
 
01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.229 align:start position:0%
Raymond and I got that one solved and
yeah

01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
sorry Cooperative collaboration to
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
achieve consensus is now in place
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
okay attorney I relative to the 170 G8
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
confidentiality uh that you kindly
 
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
provided it uh I want to ask your
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
guidance on relative to the authority
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
having jurisdiction it appears to be the
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner or design on
 
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.870 align:start position:0%
commissioner or design on
whether

01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
information it says here if it outweighs
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
the need for the disclosure then they
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
can um deny that would you have
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations on specific language
 
01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
that would need to be changed in
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
existing law so it doesn't become a
 
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
Quantum physic calculation as to impact
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
but it is application versus
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
interpretation of application of
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
distribution of confidential information
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I think this
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
study commission could potentially take
 
01:38:30.669 --> 01:38:30.679 align:start position:0%
up that question as part of of the
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
multidisiplinary team I can tell you
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
from when I was a dcyf attorney um so
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
these aren't 91a requests so they're not
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
handled in quite the same way these 170
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
g8a information requests typically do go
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
to the legal department within any uh
 
01:38:49.589 --> 01:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
district office and then the discussion
 
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
is held um at that level of weighing the
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
those pros and cons of danger to that
 
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
child for the disclosure versus the
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
parents right under the statute to get
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
the records it can go all the way up to
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
field administrator level or you know
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
dcyf State office level typically the
 
01:39:10.589 --> 01:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner herself is not involved in
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
those conversations um but it certainly
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
could be um part of a conversation
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
around this statute I think this multi-
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
disciplinary team because the parent is
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
not part of that professional team That
 
01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.030 align:start position:0%
not part of that professional team That
explicit

01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
question would not come up but this
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
statute's key as far as what information
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
sharing means who's assessing it and at
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
what level so um P perhaps language
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
could be offered um I
 
01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
think I don't know of any personal cases
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
where this has been an issue right now
 
01:39:46.109 --> 01:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
it it is meant to the whole statute is
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
meant to protect children so it is
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
weighed with the child safety in mind
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
one followup Mr chair follow up they
 
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
stipulate to agreeing with you on
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
protecting the children that's not up
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
for debate the issue is the application
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
of the protection for the children as
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
you both of correctly pointed out if the
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner is playing a major role in
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
this is there a representative I was
 
01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
just looking at who's the members of the
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee is there a representative of
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office that then
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
would then that should be if not so
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
designated a part of this uh
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort so the folks that
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
are on this particular study commission
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
are relating more specifically to that
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team so it is the
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
director of dcyf who would sort of
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
represent the field and then the a
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative of the DCF legal
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
department because it is the dcyf legal
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
department that ultimately is making
 
01:40:42.239 --> 01:40:43.229 align:start position:0%
department that ultimately is making
these

01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:43.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
interpretations of
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
statutory release so it is DCF legal
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
that has decided even though this is our
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
cap exam that we have done we can't show
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
it to anybody else because that's how
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
we're reading the statute so I think
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
probably especially because DHHS is such
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
a huge uh Department the commissioner's
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
office is not really a person that's
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
involved with this multi- disciplinary
 
01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
team particularly but it is dcyf legal
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
as well as DCF director who's ultimately
 
01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
kind of assessing those specific cases
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay I'll leave it at that thank thank
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
you attorney thank you Mr
 
01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:27.430 align:start position:0%
you attorney thank you Mr
chairman

01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
after a Resolute search I see no hands
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
up so thank you so much thank you and
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
this uh concludes the hearing on Senate
 
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.589 align:start position:0%
this uh concludes the hearing on Senate
Bill

01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
572 Senator Ward and I had an extensive
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
conversation about a few aspects of this
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
bill so you are now being
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
handed an
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
yes this is hot off the press the
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
amendment has been worked and reworked
 
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
um and once you
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh can I have one please sorry may I
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
have one excuse
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
me so once you get it I suggest you put
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
it side by side with
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
um the original bill the bill is
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
submitted and I'll walk you through the
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
made and for the OCA purposes uh let me
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
give you a sneak peek uh for reasons
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
I'll elaborate everybody else on the
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
commission now becomes consultants and
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
the only members of the renamed
 
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
committee are five legislators this is
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
because of recently passed RSA
 
01:42:57.870 --> 01:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
1449 but everybody who was not a
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
legislator who was in the commission is
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
also being mentioned by title as
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
consultants because we want them there
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then there's a few other adjustments
 
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
along the way so this is not substantive
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
to the task of this group it is simply a
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
matter of bringing the membership into
 
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
compliance with uh an RSA so if
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
everybody has um both please look at the
 
01:43:28.239 --> 01:43:29.550 align:start position:0%
everybody has um both please look at the
original

01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
26 line 26 says notwithstanding RSA 1449
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
the membership of the commission shall
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
be in other words I know it's in law but
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it that way um
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
we're backing off that um and so if you
 
01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
look over at the amend Amendment page 1
 
01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
line 11 the members of the committee and
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%

of the Senate is appointed by the
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate Senator Ward
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
suggests four members of the House
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Speaker of the House of
 
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives one from this committee
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
one from Health and Human Services
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs committee and two
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
members from any
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
committee we want to make sure we get
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
the subject matter expert s from the
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
house appointed as they will do in the
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
Senate at least one of whom shall be a
 
01:44:31.709 --> 01:44:31.719 align:start position:0%
member of the minority party now look at
 
01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
line 16 the committee shall te shall
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
seek testimony from various persons and
 
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
agencies in order to accomplish its
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
purpose these shall include but not
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
limited to that's the whole list of
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
people and the bill is submitted on the
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
top of page two it's the same folks we
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
want them there
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
but the reason the LSR was was made was
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
large committees with Quorum uh find
 
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't make their Quorum
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
they have difficulties in steering a
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
large ship so we want them to come if
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
they want to come to every meeting
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
they're welcome to if they only can come
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
to certain meetings that doesn't
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
penalize the work of the committee so
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's the main change but continuing on
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
therefore uh page two in the
 
01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:31.950 align:start position:0%
therefore uh page two in the
amendment

01:45:31.950 --> 01:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
um the original bill says this group
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
will meet 10
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
times and then it said the preliminary
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
report will be November 1st good luck
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
and then it said the final report will
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
be in 2025 which is after the
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
election so there some we saw some
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
difficulties with that and so the 10
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
meetings is out they can meet as often
 
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
as the five of them are willing to meet
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the final report is due in
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
2024 so that is the amendment Senate
 
01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:11.239 align:start position:0%
award and I came up with um which we
 
01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
think makes this a more wieldy
 
01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:17.430 align:start position:0%
think makes this a more wieldy
committee

01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
um so I'll give you a minute
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
to chew on that and ask any questions Mr
 
01:46:28.589 --> 01:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
chairman may I yes um same question uh
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
page two line 21 of which bill the bill
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%

line1 um same question with with the
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
since the other Bill the mileage members
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee should receive mileage
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the legislative rate all I can say is
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
I've been serving on committees and
 
01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
commissions for eight years now here and
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%

behind a pregnant girlfriend with no

that makes for a heart-wrenching

Hallmark movie it has absolutely no

can only enlist with parental permission

finally took a modum of action in
 
01:59:20.589 --> 01:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
raising the marriage age from 13 for
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%

02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
payment requirements marriage at that
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
time was a financial best case scenario
 
02:01:22.069 --> 02:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
the past 50 years have changed the
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
landscape of financial opportunity for
 
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
American women dramatically we need to
 
02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
recognize the so socialization of women
 
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
and girls in the 1950s and 60s is so
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
very different than today I'm thrilled
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
to be joined here today by Advocates
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
from the national organization dedicated
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
to the eradication of child marriage in
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
America Unchained at last they will be
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
providing the committee with more
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
in-depth statistics and personal
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
experience as a visual for a moment
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
think about the Hall of
 
02:02:05.790 --> 02:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives now fill that room
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
halfway and those are the children
 
02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:10.470 align:start position:0%
halfway and those are the children
married

02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
married
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
off imagine facing each one of those
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
kids trapped in a marriage contract they
 
02:02:20.669 --> 02:02:20.679 align:start position:0%
cannot exit and say there just aren't
 
02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
enough of you to just ify my doing
 
02:02:24.669 --> 02:02:24.679 align:start position:0%
anything to prevent this Hall from
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
filling up keep in mind none of those
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
children can gain sanctuary in a
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
domestic violence shelter if they need
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
it because they aren't old enough I want
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
to make it eminently clear that raising
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
the age of marriage does not in any way
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
shape or form pass judgment on anyone
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
else's marriagein marriage origin story
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
my parents included we can celebrate
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
those who followed a Teenage Love Affair
 
02:02:59.310 --> 02:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
into a decades long marriage while
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
simultaneously acknowledging that
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
marriage is more than a love story it's
 
02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
a contract too a contract that should be
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
entered into by consenting adults we are
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
the policy makers we can make this right
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
and set the legal age to enter into a
 
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
marriage contract at 18 cont contracts
 
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:25.000 align:start position:0%

02:03:48.990 --> 02:03:49.000 align:start position:0%

02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
minutes Senator Al Shiller could you

02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
yeah you
 
02:04:48.549 --> 02:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
did okay okay the clock starts now thank
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
thankk you so I'm rent Timothy Horan
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
from Stafford County District which is
 
02:04:55.629 --> 02:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
just a town of town of Durham so I was
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
around in um 2009 when we passed the
 
02:05:02.350 --> 02:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
marriage equality law which actually um
 
02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of a same you know
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage both parties had to be
 
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
18 and I think that was part of a
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
process of uh perhaps simplifying and
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
clarifying our understanding what
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
marriage is which is it's first and
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
foremost a contract between two people
 
02:05:23.709 --> 02:05:23.719 align:start position:0%
and we used to think that one had to be
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
male and one was female and now it's
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
common place for people of the same
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
gender to marry but that's
 
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh that was something we recognized when
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
we uh created same gender marriage it's
 
02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
something that should apply to uh when
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
they a male and the female are are
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
marrying I mean yes people who married
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
their lives are connected in all sorts
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
of ways and but there's lots of people
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
um who aren't married to each other who
 
02:05:51.149 --> 02:05:51.159 align:start position:0%
are raising children lots of people have
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
married to other who are living together
 
02:05:54.669 --> 02:05:54.679 align:start position:0%
lots of people who aren't married to
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
each other who are having sex and that
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
was true before 2009 it's even more true
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
now so I think
 
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
um so I think uh having a Uniform age of
 
02:06:08.109 --> 02:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
18 to enter into the marriage contract
 
02:06:12.189 --> 02:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
is uh is is just basically the way to go
 
02:06:14.109 --> 02:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
so there it's just not an
 
02:06:16.990 --> 02:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
equal it's just not a valid relationship
 
02:06:19.709 --> 02:06:19.719 align:start position:0%
if either party or perhaps in some case
 
02:06:22.270 --> 02:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
both are not able to enter into a
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
contract without parental uh parental
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
permission and of course the marriage
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
the divorce rate for people marry you
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
know child marriages is very high and
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
some cases uh the need to divorce
 
02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
happens even
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
before um the party is is 18 and that
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
creates a very major problem since they
 
02:06:46.589 --> 02:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
uh aren't able to initiate the divorce
 
02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings um if they're under 18 so
 
02:06:51.790 --> 02:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
that's um so I think uh I think just
 
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
build a simple common sense it just
 
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
clarifies what the evolution we've
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
already seen in merage law over the
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
years and it as I said it's a contract
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
between those two people and there's
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
lots of other stuff involved but it's
 
02:07:06.030 --> 02:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
basically a commitment between those two
 
02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
people so they should both be able uh
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
they should both be adults and able to
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
freely enter into the contract and I
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if the military thing is
 
02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
going apparently it's not going to come
 
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
up during this hearing today which is
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
good but it it has come up on the floor
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the past and um so the military Ary
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
um the only the the military U you can
 
02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
your child is eligible for military
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
benefits regardless of whether you're
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
married to the other parent there's only
 
02:07:36.990 --> 02:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
issue is maybe you can't live on the
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
base if you're not married to 10 seconds
 
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
repres um the military thing which may
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
or may not come up during this debate C
 
02:07:46.109 --> 02:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
apparently not during the hearing is non
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
is kind of nonsensical and if you feel
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to come up you probably
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
should have your researcher clarify it
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
cuz any questions for the
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative thanks representative
 
02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:57.910 align:start position:0%
representative thanks representative
Panic

02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
Panic
 
02:08:02.189 --> 02:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm my understanding is once a 16
 
02:08:06.229 --> 02:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
or 17y old enters into a marital
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
contract that they are considered by the
 
02:08:15.629 --> 02:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
state an adult and that they could go to
 
02:08:20.109 --> 02:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
see a lawyer and get the marriage
 
02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
nullified or go through a divorce cuz
 
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
once they me enter into a marital
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
contract they considered adults so I
 
02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
think it that's what I my understanding
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
was last year when this bill came well
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
that I would just say I'm not
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily the right person answered i'
 
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not a I'm not a lawyer I've also
 
02:08:42.189 --> 02:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
actually never been legally married but
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
I have been in Partnership so I would
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
just say that's probably something um we
 
02:08:48.030 --> 02:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
should have our excellent research team
 
02:08:49.629 --> 02:08:49.639 align:start position:0%
clarify because I'm not sure if that's
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
actually true but even if you are sort
 
02:08:53.549 --> 02:08:53.559 align:start position:0%
of Legally considered an adult it's
 
02:08:55.629 --> 02:08:55.639 align:start position:0%
still more difficult if you're um under
 
02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
18 and then there's problems you know
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
after the divorce is granted too so I
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
would I would just I would my first
 
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
impression is um I I disagree with what
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying but that's probably an
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
issue that uh we should have the
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
research to clarify if you think that's
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
an issue before we exec the bill and
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
certainly um it should be clarified
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
before we have the floor debate because
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
I know I know a lot of site issues have
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
come in in past floor debates and derail
 
02:09:20.589 --> 02:09:20.599 align:start position:0%
previous attempts to pass this
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
legislation so that's about about all I
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
have to say although that was probably a
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
fairly lengthy answer but thank you any
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%

02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%

year or two um I used to I haven't um
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
gotten the full
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
update I'm sure I'm sure somebody will
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
be bringing that forward yeah zero and
 
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
the year before I think there was
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
two no somebody with the answers will be
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
bringing them for so let us not
 
02:13:33.149 --> 02:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:13:38.069 --> 02:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
Perez uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you know that I'm
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
being very vocal about this issue and
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
then I always support anything that has
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
to do with child marriage but my
 
02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:51.559 align:start position:0%
question to do is um online two and
 
02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
three uh no person below the age of 18
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
she'll be capable of Contracting a Val
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
marriage or marriage contract as such a
 
02:14:04.189 --> 02:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
person should be null or void
 
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
um this is my only
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
concern and I know that I'm a Survivor
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
that you know I was I was married when I
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
was younger but my concern is that we
 
02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
have people coming from other countries
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we have different different points
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
of view
 
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
and by no or avoiding something I'm I'm
 
02:14:28.270 --> 02:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
just concerned that not every single
 
02:14:31.390 --> 02:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
marriage ended into abuse relationship
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
or uh not work uh that's the only
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
concern that I do have so that would
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
fall under where we do we're state to
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
state type thing where we do recognize
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
that and if you get married like out of
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
state where they allow it or out of the
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
country where they do allow that then
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have to fall under Federal
 
02:14:56.109 --> 02:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction I believe that's the Full
 
02:14:57.870 --> 02:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
Faith and Credit Clause of the
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution so they wouldn't suddenly
 
02:15:03.149 --> 02:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
be unmarried when they moved to New
 
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%

02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
they be able to go to a domestic abuse
 
02:16:20.990 --> 02:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
shelter um I because they're underage
 
02:16:24.189 --> 02:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
believe anybody under the age of 18 will
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
be turned away from all domestic abuse
 
02:16:30.189 --> 02:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
shelters because they do not have a
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
legal guardian with them and most of
 
02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.230 align:start position:0%
legal guardian with them and most of
those

02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
that um like if someone is trying to get
 
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
away from their spouse or whoever then
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
in these instances of child marriages
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
there are many victims who have gone to
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
domestic violence shelters and who have
 
02:16:52.190 --> 02:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
been turned away or the police have been
 
02:16:54.589 --> 02:16:54.599 align:start position:0%
escorted back to escorted them back to
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
their parents or their legal guardian
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
who happens to be their husband who then
 
02:17:03.309 --> 02:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
further abuses them even more because
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
they try to get away from them followup
 
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I think probably that my question
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
isn't really germing into your bill or
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment but maybe we can work on
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
something like that in the future
 
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:18.760 align:start position:0%

as um as you've heard heart disease um

higher rates of being uh trafficked um
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
something as simple as back pain all of
 
02:19:27.070 --> 02:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
these things can be mitigated by having
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
protective factors in place having
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
supportive uh adults outside of their

homes having
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
um uh access to services this bill is a
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
really important and critical step in
 
02:19:43.469 --> 02:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
establishing one of those protective
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
factors protecting our young kids from
 
02:19:48.150 --> 02:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
entering into a contract and having
 
02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%

these traumatic
experiences

02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
I'll also note that this is part of a
 
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
national movement there have been um 11
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
states soon to be 12 states that have um
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
enacted legislation similar to this um
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
to end child marriage in their states
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
additionally um to answer rep panic's
 
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
question there have been 215 minors
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
married since 2000 between 20 2 and
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
20123 um since 2019 there have been nine
 
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
children who have been married 83% of
 
02:20:27.389 --> 02:20:27.399 align:start position:0%
these were girls wed to adult men with
 
02:20:29.790 --> 02:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
an average age difference of 4 years
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
older from the child who was married and
 
02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
the 2018 legislation was certainly well-
 
02:20:38.670 --> 02:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
intended but only protected about 4% of
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
the individuals that it needed to
 
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
protect the rest of those those um cases
 
02:20:47.469 --> 02:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
are aged 17 and above every single life
 
02:20:50.110 --> 02:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
is important even one child marriage is
 
02:20:51.389 --> 02:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
too many
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
um we have done as a state so much to
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
invest in our system of care and invest
 
02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
in the mental well-being of our children
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
I think this is an a a critical next
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
step in ensuring that we mitigate Aces
 
02:21:05.070 --> 02:21:05.080 align:start position:0%

02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
last and that intrigued me earlier when
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:11.269 --> 02:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
term good afternoon my name is Becca
 
02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
Powell and I'm here representing
 
02:24:14.429 --> 02:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
Unchained at last uh the Survivor Le
 
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that's dedicated to ending
 
02:24:17.309 --> 02:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
forc and child marriage in the United
 
02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
States uh the 2018 legislation that
 
02:24:21.309 --> 02:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
raised the marriage AG to 16 was very
 
02:24:22.910 --> 02:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
well intentioned but it didn't go far
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
enough 96% of the minors who married in
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire before 2018 were aged 16
 
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
or 17 so the 2018 legislation only
 
02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
protected 4% of the individuals it was
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
intended to protect but s SP 359 isn't
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
about creating a better system to enter
 
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
minors into marriage this bill will do
 
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
what 11 other US states have done and
 
02:24:43.150 --> 02:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
set the marriage age at 18 no exceptions
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh because child marriage itself is
 
02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
inherently dangerous as you heard this
 
02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with maturity minors
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
don't automatically wake up on their
 
02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
18th birthday with some new wisdom or
 
02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
ability to make good decisions what they
 
02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
do wake up with is all the rights of
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
adulthood they didn't have even the day
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
before and that's so crucial especially
 
02:24:59.309 --> 02:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
for a minor who is being forced to marry
 
02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
before minor turns 18 they can't even
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
open the door and leave home to get away
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
if their parents are planning an
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
unwanted wedding for them uh minors who
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
run away from home are repeatedly
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
repeatedly can be deemed a child in need
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
of services and summoned to a court
 
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
hearing to determine further
 
02:25:13.469 --> 02:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action in our experience
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
domestic violence shelters across the US
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
will routinely turn away unaccompanied
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
minors and youth shelters in general are
 
02:25:20.349 --> 02:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
not a solution uh they typically only
 
02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
limit the state of 21 days and their
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
main goal is to reunite that minor with
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
their parents uh additionally a minor
 
02:25:27.309 --> 02:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
can easily retain an attorney because
 
02:25:28.910 --> 02:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
contracts with miners are voidable and
 
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
they generally can't file a legal action
 
02:25:31.870 --> 02:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
which just creates additional obstacles
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
for them and representative panic I want
 
02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
to address a question you asked earlier
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
yes miners are automatically emancipated
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
upon marriage which does bring some
 
02:25:41.269 --> 02:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
limited legal rights of adulthood
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
however these rights do arrive too late
 
02:25:44.990 --> 02:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
to prevent a forced marriage that minor
 
02:25:46.510 --> 02:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
would first have to undergo the trauma
 
02:25:47.870 --> 02:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
of a forced marriage which in our
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
experience can typically mean being
 
02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
pulled out of school raped on her
 
02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
wedding night and forced into a life of
 
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual servitude and you
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
can't undo this trauma and you can't
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
unrape a minor just by giving them some
 
02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
limited rights of adulthood by
 
02:26:02.429 --> 02:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
emancipating them afterwards also the
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
rights of emancipated minors are as I
 
02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
said limited in our experience domestic
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
violent shelters will turn away even
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
emancipated minors and emancipated
 
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
minors often have trouble accessing the
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
rights that they do have imagine for
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
example how a landlord would feel uh
 
02:26:17.389 --> 02:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
about renting an apartment to a 16 or
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
17-year-old uh and because of these
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
limitations globally child marriage is
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
recognized all child marriage is
 
02:26:24.990 --> 02:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
recognized as being forced marriage
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
because minors just simply do not have
 
02:26:28.830 --> 02:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
all of the rights of adulthood they need
 
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
to enter any contract let alone a
 
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
contract as serious as marriage and
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
because of this when girls have reached
 
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
out to Unchained who provides Direct
 
02:26:37.389 --> 02:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
Services to those who are facing forced
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
marriages when girls under 18 have
 
02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
reached out and asked for our help and
 
02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
have learned of their limited legal
 
02:26:43.389 --> 02:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
options we've unfortunately seen some
 
02:26:45.389 --> 02:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
turn to self harm and even suicide
 
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
attempts uh so for all those reasons I
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
ask you to please do what the Senate did
 
02:26:51.389 --> 02:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
and vote Yes on SP 359 and I'm happy to
 
02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:27:00.429 --> 02:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um are you
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with our present
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
law here in New Hampshire yes uh 16 and
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
17 year olds can uh enter into marriage
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
with the consent of one parent and
 
02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:10.349 align:start position:0%
with the consent of one parent and
judicial

02:27:10.349 --> 02:27:10.359 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
review follow up um because I um do
 
02:27:18.030 --> 02:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
think that um they do have certain
 
02:27:21.309 --> 02:27:21.319 align:start position:0%
legal uh rights under that law
 
02:27:23.389 --> 02:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
so as I said yes when they're married
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
they're automatically emancipated and
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
they do get some limited rights of
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
adulthood um but as I mentioned those
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
rights arrive too late to prevent a
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
forced marriage and you know that trauma
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately can't be undone just by
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
giving them some of those limited rights
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
of adulthood um and additionally as I
 
02:27:39.269 --> 02:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned those rights are only limited
 
02:27:40.830 --> 02:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
and in our experience domestic violence
 
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
minors thank you for your testimony
 
02:27:51.070 --> 02:27:51.080 align:start position:0%

okay three minutes thank you I am
 
02:28:26.110 --> 02:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
Michelle hanash I am the director of
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
policy and women's programs at the AA
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
Foundation we are a nonprofit working to
 
02:28:32.910 --> 02:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
end harmful practices like child
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
marriage we also receive those help
 
02:28:37.230 --> 02:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
requests from individuals fleeing Force
 
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
marriages across the us including from
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
minors and it is because of these
 
02:28:44.269 --> 02:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking stories that we are so
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
adamantly in support of s SP
 
02:28:50.269 --> 02:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
359 and keeping the marriage age at 18
 
02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
and eliminating the dangerous loopholes
 
02:28:54.269 --> 02:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
that allow for children to be entered
 
02:28:56.429 --> 02:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
into marriage and I believe in the past
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
it had been asked whether it would be a
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
good idea to add a military exception to
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
the marriage age that's not currently
 
02:29:07.269 --> 02:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
the law and that's not proposed in s359
 
02:29:08.670 --> 02:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to take just a few minutes
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
to explain why that would not be a good
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
idea so first to explain the common
 
02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
misconception you do not need to be
 
02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
married to list the mother of your baby
 
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
or anyone for that matter is the benefit
 
02:29:22.030 --> 02:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
ICI of your death benefits and as you
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
heard children receive service members
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
benefits regardless of their marital
 
02:29:29.790 --> 02:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
status and using other spousal benefits
 
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
that would not apply like health
 
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
insurance or housing to a non-married
 
02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
partner are not a reason to keep
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
children entered into child marriage
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
using someone's Current financial
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
dependency as a as a justification for
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
child marriage will only keep them
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
further dependent and ryant on public
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
assistance government aid for a lifetime
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
we all believe that there are other

02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
those children receive protection as
 
02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
much as any child being forced to marry

economic freedom educational opport
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%

02:30:58.830 --> 02:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
much any
 
02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:01.070 align:start position:0%
much any
questions

02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
aha representative I might as well just
 
02:31:05.469 --> 02:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
get everybody upset with me we're not
 
02:31:07.269 --> 02:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
upset with you well after I say this
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
we'll our lunch quickly thank you Mr
 
02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.710 align:start position:0%
we'll our lunch quickly thank you Mr
chairman

02:31:11.710 --> 02:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:31:16.389 --> 02:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
um my confusion here
 
02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
is we're advocating for genital
 
02:31:22.269 --> 02:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries for children
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
under 18 years old but you're not going
 
02:31:27.429 --> 02:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
to allow them to be married under 18
 
02:31:31.429 --> 02:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
years old I can't seem to line those two
 
02:31:34.910 --> 02:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
different thought processes up I think
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
something like this needs to be left
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
alone it has to be a question
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative I mean how do you how do
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
you how do you justify that part and
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
then this part here where you're saying
 
02:31:49.990 --> 02:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
you can't get married well reassign
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
genital surgeries but we won't allow you
 
02:31:56.910 --> 02:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
to get married it just how do you as
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
square that away sure thank you for the
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
question as as people have mentioned
 
02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
marriage is a contractual relationship
 
02:32:07.030 --> 02:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
18 is the age to enter into
 
02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
contracts setting the marriage age at 18
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
I should say keeping the marriage age at
 
02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
18 and eliminating the loopless is
 
02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
entirely consistent with the laws when
 
02:32:19.389 --> 02:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
it comes to entering into a contract and
 
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
we should
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
um allow children to be abused because
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
of other issues that are being debated
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
when it comes to legislation ending
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
child marriage is entirely consistent
 
02:32:32.429 --> 02:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
with the laws on childhood and on
 
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
contracts and
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise having loopholes in the law
 
02:32:40.269 --> 02:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
completely makes a mockery of of so many
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
other laws when it comes to
 
02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
children thank you any further
 
02:32:48.910 --> 02:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Trey recognizes Mr
 
02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:53.550 align:start position:0%

Dana
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning Mr
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you uh just to address a
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
few things I heard earlier to begin with
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
a brief anecdote I once found myself
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
outside an abortion clinic speaking to a
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
young African-American gentleman very
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
upset uh that his uh European girlfriend
 
02:33:34.030 --> 02:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh was not going to allow him to be a
 
02:33:38.670 --> 02:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
father and so it seems uh uh this is off
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
topic please speak to the bill a brief
 
02:33:45.469 --> 02:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
anecdote to uh frame the bill please all
 
02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
right so the First Choice it seems is
 
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
death and I'm speaking to rep PR's
 
02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
content uh comment and after facing
 
02:33:59.830 --> 02:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
death we Face birth and then directly to
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
rep Perez's comment the next choice we
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
face is a gender assignment and whether
 
02:34:09.269 --> 02:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
we are think we ought to be a boy or a
 
02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
girl at a very young
 
02:34:15.150 --> 02:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
age uh after that we Face the choice of
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
who we find
 
02:34:19.150 --> 02:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
attractive after that we chase the
 
02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
choice of
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
whether to consummate
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
that after that it
 
02:34:29.309 --> 02:34:29.319 align:start position:0%
seems uh today's reality is we decide
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
whether that ought to be a marriage
 
02:34:37.269 --> 02:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:41.269 --> 02:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
death and um I find this a curious order
 
02:34:41.279 --> 02:34:42.590 align:start position:0%
death and um I find this a curious order
of

02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
events and if you go to the most recent
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
02:34:50.429 --> 02:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
case uh
 
02:34:50.439 --> 02:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
case uh
uh

02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:57.429 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:00.990 --> 02:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
2 2590 it says a third the US Supreme
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
Court says a third basis for protecting
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
the right to marry is that it safeguards
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
children and families and thus draws
 
02:35:09.269 --> 02:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
meaning from related rights of
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
childbearing procreation and education
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
going back to pierce V Society of sis uh
 
02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
sisters uh protecting religious
 
02:35:21.309 --> 02:35:21.319 align:start position:0%
minorities so while many view marriage
 
02:35:24.510 --> 02:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
is a legal contract if you look at line
 
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
15 here it says no magistrate or
 
02:35:30.429 --> 02:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
minister of religion so solemnize any
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
marriage I submit there are many who
 
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
view it not as a legal contract but a
 
02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:38.230 align:start position:0%
view it not as a legal contract but a
religious

02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
religious
 
02:35:42.830 --> 02:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how this bill is written
 
02:35:51.469 --> 02:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't run a foul of Berger fell both
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of due
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
process uh recognizing full faith and
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
credit and recognizing First Amendment
 
02:36:03.230 --> 02:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
rights and granted it may be a very tiny
 
02:36:05.309 --> 02:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
minority but I would just urge you to
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
consider this in the broader context of
 
02:36:11.269 --> 02:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
all of these issues and at what ages all
 
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
of these sort of events ought to occur
 
02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:15.630 align:start position:0%
of these sort of events ought to occur
thank

02:36:15.630 --> 02:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
you any
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing thank you for your
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
testimony um I do know that in Most
 
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
states the minister of religion is both
 
02:36:31.790 --> 02:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
a minister of the sacrament and um a
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
legal representative of the state and I
 
02:36:37.309 --> 02:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
do know that in those states where
 
02:36:39.870 --> 02:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes those are in Conflict uh that
 
02:36:40.910 --> 02:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
discussion can the minister solize
 
02:36:45.790 --> 02:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
matrimony for the church and not be a
 
02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative of the state when those
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
two things Clash I'll just leave that as
 
02:36:52.830 --> 02:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
an open issue okay thank you these are

02:37:32.269 --> 02:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I'm sorry here in New
 
02:37:34.510 --> 02:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire allowing 16 and 17 year olds
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
to be entered into marriage actually
 
02:37:39.389 --> 02:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
encourages legalizes and incentivizes
 
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
the trafficking of minors under the
 
02:37:44.070 --> 02:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
guise of marriage the way it works is
 
02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
the federal government does not specify
 
02:37:49.550 --> 02:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
any minimum age for marriage and this is
 
02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
a really dangerous and gaping and
 
02:37:53.550 --> 02:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
shameful loophole in federal law that
 
02:37:57.150 --> 02:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
allows and encourages the trafficking of
 
02:37:59.630 --> 02:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
minors in the US and mostly it's girls
 
02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
who are trafficked for the US
 
02:38:03.469 --> 02:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
citizenship forced to marry adult men
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
overseas who get a visa and a path to
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
citizenship it also encourages and
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
legalizes the opposite men in the US can
 
02:38:12.990 --> 02:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
bring in traffic sex traffic girls from
 
02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
overseas minor girls under the guise of
 
02:38:18.670 --> 02:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
marriage and it's perfectly legal so the
 
02:38:21.550 --> 02:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
way it works is that USCIS and the state
 
02:38:23.670 --> 02:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
department are allowed to approve the
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
petition of a spous for a spousal fiance
 
02:38:29.230 --> 02:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
visa involving a minor only if the
 
02:38:31.309 --> 02:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
marriage would be legal in the state
 
02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
where the couple will reside and that
 
02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
means that right now in New Hampshire
 
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
USCIS and the state department can
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
approve these petitions for minors as
 
02:38:41.950 --> 02:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
young as 16 and 17 almost all of our
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
neighboring states in fact every single
 
02:38:46.269 --> 02:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
one except for Maine has addressed this
 
02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
problem by making the marriage age 18 no
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions because that way USCIS and
 
02:38:52.510 --> 02:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
the state department cannot approve
 
02:38:54.030 --> 02:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
these marriages but here in New
 
02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our girls are not being
 
02:38:58.030 --> 02:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
protected and this is not a small
 
02:38:59.550 --> 02:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
problem by the way the US Senate
 
02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security committee issued a
 
02:39:02.349 --> 02:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
report in
 
02:39:04.510 --> 02:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
2017 that showed that in the decade
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
leading up to that report there were
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
almost 9,000 petitions for a spousal
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
fiance visa involving a minor as young
 
02:39:15.550 --> 02:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
as 13 that were approved by USCIS and
 
02:39:18.510 --> 02:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
the younger party was a girl in 95% of
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
those cases let's catch up to the rest
 
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
of our uh to the rest of our neighbors
 
02:39:25.389 --> 02:39:25.399 align:start position:0%
and uh 11 states across the US that have
 
02:39:26.670 --> 02:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
solved this problem by making the
 
02:39:28.349 --> 02:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
marriage age 8 no exceptions and
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
stopping the legal trafficking of
 
02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
minors any
 
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nelson hi thank
 
02:39:37.870 --> 02:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
02:39:42.190 --> 02:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
my question I just I wanted to um just
 
02:39:44.670 --> 02:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
get some clarification from you
 
02:39:51.389 --> 02:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
um so you're saying that even if we have
 
02:39:56.190 --> 02:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh per RSA uh age limitations and
 
02:39:58.990 --> 02:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
residency limitations here in New
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already in law that the
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
Federal Government Can supersede
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
that so what I'm saying is the federal
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
government cannot supersede the minimum
 
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
age but it can follow the minimum age
 
02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
and since the minimum age now is 16 that
 
02:40:16.429 --> 02:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
means minors at age 16 or 17 can be
 
02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
legally trafficked because USCIS can
 
02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
approve that if we made the marriage age
 
02:40:23.429 --> 02:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
18 the USCIS would not be able to
 
02:40:26.990 --> 02:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
approve the uh spousal or fiance visas
 
02:40:29.830 --> 02:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
for minors as young as 16 and 17 who are
 
02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
being forced right now to uh marry adult
 
02:40:34.590 --> 02:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
men overseas so they br traffic for
 
02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
their citizenship can I please have a
 
02:40:39.389 --> 02:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
follow follow um I believe in current
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
statute um both um parties have to be
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents my understanding
 
02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
is that one party needs to be a New
 
02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:48.230 align:start position:0%
is that one party needs to be a New
Hampshire

02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:50.429 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
resident

02:40:50.429 --> 02:40:50.439 align:start position:0%
resident
 
02:40:55.150 --> 02:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
oh thank you any other
 
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
questions and Sher I wonder if I could
 
02:40:58.429 --> 02:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
also address a question that was raised
 
02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
before regarding emancipation so there
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
was discussion um representative panic I
 
02:41:05.469 --> 02:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
hope that my colleague Becca explained
 
02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
why the Emancipation that you're right
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
once you're married you're emancipated
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately those rights arrive too
 
02:41:12.389 --> 02:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
late to help somebody who is being
 
02:41:14.190 --> 02:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
forced to marry something that we see
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
almost every day at unchain at last cuz
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
these girls reach out to us and we have
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
to say well nothing we can do until
 
02:41:21.469 --> 02:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
you're married but beyond that actually
 
02:41:23.429 --> 02:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
the automatic emancipation upon marriage
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
is extremely dangerous public policy
 
02:41:29.070 --> 02:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
because once a minor is married and
 
02:41:30.670 --> 02:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
emancipated they lose their parents
 
02:41:32.590 --> 02:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
financial obligation to them and
 
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
typically before we emancipate a minor
 
02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire under the new
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
emancipation statute we first make them
 
02:41:40.030 --> 02:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
prove to a court that they are
 
02:41:42.510 --> 02:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient in their personal and
 
02:41:44.830 --> 02:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
financial affairs but nobody is looking
 
02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
at that when we're emancipating minors
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
just because one of their parents
 
02:41:49.630 --> 02:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
decided it was time for them to get
 
02:41:51.110 --> 02:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
married because this can happen with
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
just one parents consent in most cases
 
02:41:55.150 --> 02:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
then we're forcing these minors to
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
become financially dependent on their on
 
02:41:59.230 --> 02:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
their spouse which is a known risk
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
factor for domestic violence but it also
 
02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
creates another perverse incentive for a
 
02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
parent to force their own child to marry
 
02:42:08.269 --> 02:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is that parents are
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
using this as a way to unilaterally
 
02:42:12.630 --> 02:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
terminate the parental rights of the
 
02:42:14.830 --> 02:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
other parent they can one parent can
 
02:42:16.910 --> 02:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
marry off their 16 or 17-year-old
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
without even notifying the other parent
 
02:42:20.590 --> 02:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
and then the minor is emancipated and
 
02:42:22.429 --> 02:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
there goes that child support obligation
 
02:42:24.510 --> 02:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
you never wanted to pay or the child
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
custody battle you want to get out of
 
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact what a case like this went
 
02:42:30.110 --> 02:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
up to the Idaho Supreme Court where a
 
02:42:31.950 --> 02:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
woman found out her aranged husband had
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
paid someone money to marry their
 
02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
16-year-old daughter so he could get out
 
02:42:38.030 --> 02:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
of their child custody battle and she
 
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
lost when she fought it out to the Idaho
 
02:42:41.550 --> 02:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Supreme Court said child
 
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:48.510 --> 02:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
do you're saying nothing further thank
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you please
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
vote Yes on S SP
 
02:42:56.030 --> 02:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
359 now just a little straw poll we
 
02:42:58.870 --> 02:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to exact this bill uh unless
 
02:43:02.030 --> 02:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
we all want to so is there anybody who
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
thinks we should wait before we exact
 
02:43:07.750 --> 02:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:10.030 --> 02:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
up seeing no
 
02:43:13.269 --> 02:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
thumbs that means we can go forward to
 
02:43:17.309 --> 02:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
exec this bill so I Clos the hearing on
 
02:43:20.510 --> 02:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 359 and I now open the exec
 
02:43:25.710 --> 02:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:36.560 align:start position:0%

02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
discussion I sensed on the part of a few
 
02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
folks little bit of hesitancy and that's
 
02:44:09.150 --> 02:44:09.160 align:start position:0%

the marriage doesn't say anything about
 
02:44:29.790 --> 02:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
justices of the peace who in this state
 
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:35.550 --> 02:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
magistrates and a Justice of the Peace
 
02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
can solemnize a
 
02:44:41.230 --> 02:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
marriage so there's one issue that I
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
have with the bill could we look at just
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
that when one would think that no
 
02:44:49.469 --> 02:44:49.479 align:start position:0%
justice of the peace May commit an act
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
against an RSA and if that person does
 
02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
so that person will be subject to some
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
strictures and the ACT would be null and
 
02:45:01.150 --> 02:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
void well doesn't say we can't do it
 
02:45:10.429 --> 02:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
know what's your pleasure we can hold up
 
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:21.550 --> 02:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
and of the argument you know we had
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
offline discussion that Justice is bound
 
02:45:26.910 --> 02:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
by the RSA so the
 
02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:31.070 align:start position:0%
by the RSA so the
RSA

02:45:31.070 --> 02:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and if you think you're doing it I
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
think I'm a star for the Red Sox so it
 
02:45:41.070 --> 02:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.269 --> 02:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
yeah anyone else for discussion
 
02:45:44.279 --> 02:45:47.590 align:start position:0%
yeah anyone else for discussion
representative

02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
Bickford um the the issue of military
 
02:45:53.550 --> 02:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
was brought up thank you Mr chair sorry
 
02:45:54.910 --> 02:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
that was that was wrong this is
 
02:45:58.269 --> 02:45:58.279 align:start position:0%
discussion I just call on you oh okay um
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
anyway military was brought up for an
 
02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
issue and one of the things in the
 
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
military as I recall they pay more if
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
you have a wife or spouse I should say
 
02:46:11.469 --> 02:46:11.479 align:start position:0%
and so they've created a benefit that
 
02:46:11.479 --> 02:46:12.830 align:start position:0%
and so they've created a benefit that
makes

02:46:12.830 --> 02:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
makes
 
02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
this uh advantageous to get married at a
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
younger age a lot of people go on the
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
service at 18 19 years old and they I'm
 
02:46:22.269 --> 02:46:22.279 align:start position:0%
going to say their girlfriend uh wants
 
02:46:25.950 --> 02:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
to be with them or at least on base and
 
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
like I say they get money doing this I
 
02:46:33.469 --> 02:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
know uh my my daughter was not underage
 
02:46:36.790 --> 02:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
but that they get extra money for being
 
02:46:38.630 --> 02:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
married you know that's not something I
 
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
really believe in because I believe in
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
equal pay for equal work but that's the
 
02:46:45.070 --> 02:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
way the system is right now and
 
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I I'm hesitant to change because that
 
02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:51.190 align:start position:0%
so I I'm hesitant to change because that
representative

02:46:51.190 --> 02:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:55.269 --> 02:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
of yeah so um I have researched this um
 
02:46:57.550 --> 02:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
I've talked to many of my friends who
 
02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
are military members I've talked to my
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
father who's military member there is no
 
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
room for a wife when it comes to basic
 
02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
training when they enter into the
 
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
military there is no wife or spousal
 
02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
housing they come with the trunk that
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
they are given and the clothes on their
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
back and then they are introduced into
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
basic training yes they do have housing
 
02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
but they follow a chain of command like
 
02:47:25.870 --> 02:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
the military does whoever is higher up
 
02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
in the chain of command they get that
 
02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
housing first and the military has
 
02:47:35.710 --> 02:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
realized that marrying their they
 
02:47:38.269 --> 02:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
realize that is an issue in
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
their that they're having with a lot of
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
their members um and I know I'm not sure
 
02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
if there's been discussions of it I know
 
02:47:48.790 --> 02:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
that I've talked to many military m
 
02:47:50.309 --> 02:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
members who have said that that is an
 
02:47:52.349 --> 02:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
issue that they're trying to face right
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
now of military members especially their
 
02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
younger boys marrying off just to get
 
02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
benefits When in fact there those
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
especially with the pregnant girls um
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
the girls that are pregnant um they have
 
02:48:12.469 --> 02:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
found other there's better ways to go
 
02:48:14.590 --> 02:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
about it then just mirroring off just
 
02:48:18.190 --> 02:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
for benefits I think that's and also if
 
02:48:19.469 --> 02:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
they find
 
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
that they are marrying just for the
 
02:48:23.910 --> 02:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
benefits then they will be Court Marshal
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
and handle the way that the military
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
will handle it they don't just let
 
02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
anybody get married just to get more
 
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
money they tend to have checks
 
02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
imbalances in that military to
 
02:48:40.830 --> 02:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
prevent members just to receive more pay
 
02:48:43.950 --> 02:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
just from having a ring on their finger
 
02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
rep Vice chairman
 
02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman um
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
yeah this is this is these discussions
 
02:48:56.269 --> 02:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
qualify why I believe that nobody should
 
02:48:58.510 --> 02:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
be married under the age of 18 I mean
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
we're having a discussion
 
02:49:02.830 --> 02:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
about a person going at the service that
 
02:49:05.550 --> 02:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
may get another 20 bucks a week if he's
 
02:49:08.670 --> 02:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
married so we're GNA you know so let's
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
incentivize that underage marriage so
 
02:49:14.349 --> 02:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
somebody entering a service could get
 
02:49:16.070 --> 02:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
extra 20 bucks or whatever they get I'm
 
02:49:19.550 --> 02:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
sure it's not very much um
 
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know and didn't we have the
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on um you know other other
 
02:49:26.469 --> 02:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
discussions on nothing to do with
 
02:49:30.070 --> 02:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
marriage and the sanctity of it but just
 
02:49:34.030 --> 02:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
an an advantage uh that's why I you know
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sticking with if you're not 18 years
 
02:49:41.349 --> 02:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
married representative
 
02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman so just to
 
02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
kind of follow up on that it's called
 
02:49:52.110 --> 02:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
so what happens in the military is you
 
02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
get um a one-time bump when you add a
 
02:49:58.309 --> 02:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
dependent it is not when you get married
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's when you add a dependent so that
 
02:50:02.269 --> 02:50:02.279 align:start position:0%
dependent could be a spouse but it could
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
also be a a
 
02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
child um
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
and it's interesting that we're having
 
02:50:10.830 --> 02:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
this discussion and I'm I'm reminded of
 
02:50:12.269 --> 02:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
um one of the representatives who spoke
 
02:50:14.349 --> 02:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
who pointed out that we allow only
 
02:50:17.070 --> 02:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage starting at 18 so if
 
02:50:19.950 --> 02:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
you have a gay military m at 17 who has
 
02:50:21.469 --> 02:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
gotten permission from his parents to
 
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
join the military and they want to get
 
02:50:25.469 --> 02:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
married now so that they can have that
 
02:50:27.630 --> 02:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
spousal benefit they're not allowed to
 
02:50:29.269 --> 02:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
they're only allowed to do it if it's
 
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
opposite sex apparently so to me for the
 
02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
fraction of a percent of individuals who
 
02:50:38.110 --> 02:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
this might apply to it's not a reason to
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
put in danger all of the other
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
individuals who are at risk of child
 
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
trafficking um and again the the bump is
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
a onetime thing when you added to
 
02:50:51.550 --> 02:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
dependent um under their I forget what
 
02:50:54.190 --> 02:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
it's called the it's their enrollment
 
02:50:56.269 --> 02:50:56.279 align:start position:0%
system it's the acronym is deers but I
 
02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
don't remember what all the the letters
 
02:51:00.110 --> 02:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
stand for but basically it's adding your
 
02:51:02.110 --> 02:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
dependence to their system and it's for
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
base housing basically and your cost of
 
02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:11.269 align:start position:0%
base housing basically and your cost of
living

02:51:11.269 --> 02:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:11.279 --> 02:51:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
increase

02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:17.110 align:start position:0%
increase

grman see at least it's the same first
 
02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
letter the first know thank you Mr

worse thank you
 
02:51:47.070 --> 02:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
um so this is my third term here and um
 
02:51:48.990 --> 02:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
this has been discussed since my first
 
02:51:52.590 --> 02:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
term with um representative Cassie L
 
02:51:55.990 --> 02:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward for us um and I
 
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely support this
 
02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
legislation um going round and round it
 
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
it my head you know we're putting kids
 
02:52:09.950 --> 02:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
at risk we're putting young adults at
 
02:52:13.229 --> 02:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
risk so whatever benefit May
 
02:52:16.590 --> 02:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
outweigh whether it's a bump in pay or
 
02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
what housing whatever it may may
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
be the effect on our
 
02:52:28.229 --> 02:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
society when we have
 
02:52:31.710 --> 02:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
traumatized individuals that have
 
02:52:34.269 --> 02:52:34.279 align:start position:0%
experienced trauma
 
02:52:34.279 --> 02:52:36.030 align:start position:0%
experienced trauma
and

02:52:36.030 --> 02:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:38.910 --> 02:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
coercion that's going to affect us down
 
02:52:40.990 --> 02:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
the road
 
02:52:43.870 --> 02:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
um the other piece that's always come up
 
02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
is this notion
 
02:52:51.870 --> 02:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
that a young person under 18 can't
 
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
access help if they're in a domestic
 
02:52:55.040 --> 02:52:56.710 align:start position:0%
access help if they're in a domestic
violence

02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:52:59.710 --> 02:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
situation that has continuously come up
 
02:53:02.469 --> 02:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
over and over being turned away from
 
02:53:05.469 --> 02:53:05.479 align:start position:0%
from support and help because they're a
 
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
minor not being able to get a lawyer I
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
remember our first term it was I don't
 
02:53:13.469 --> 02:53:13.479 align:start position:0%
think you could get a hotel
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
room as you know you couldn't get a
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
hotel room so you could get married um
 
02:53:24.269 --> 02:53:24.279 align:start position:0%
so once again here we are and I'll be
 
02:53:26.590 --> 02:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
voting um in support of raising the
 
02:53:34.590 --> 02:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
you the chair wishes to thank Gabby M
 
02:53:41.309 --> 02:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
Grossman for her
 
02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
contribution and now the uh chair
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Greg thank you
 
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I think you know there's
 
02:53:51.349 --> 02:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of things when we look at
 
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
this bill and and between the house bill
 
02:53:55.790 --> 02:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
that we had um this last year and then
 
02:53:57.269 --> 02:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
this bill you know we're always looking
 
02:54:00.990 --> 02:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
at you know a what type of kiddo in this
 
02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
day and age is getting married that
 
02:54:03.950 --> 02:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
early and we always go back to these
 
02:54:06.590 --> 02:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
abuse things and and I think there's a
 
02:54:08.349 --> 02:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
another thing that we're kind of missing
 
02:54:09.950 --> 02:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
here and I know that the New Hampshire
 
02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
way is we have our own little unique way
 
02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
of doing things and that's that's
 
02:54:15.309 --> 02:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
usually pretty great when we start to
 
02:54:17.950 --> 02:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
see all the states around us um passing
 
02:54:19.750 --> 02:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
these these marriage laws where we're
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to 18 what does that make us it
 
02:54:24.229 --> 02:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't make us the outlier who needs to
 
02:54:26.070 --> 02:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
play katchup what it makes us is it
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
makes us more attractive who is it
 
02:54:30.229 --> 02:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
making us more attractive to it's making
 
02:54:32.710 --> 02:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
us more attractive to these traffickers
 
02:54:34.870 --> 02:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes we've only had so many marriages in
 
02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
this last year but let's look at it we
 
02:54:40.190 --> 02:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
have a n International problem of
 
02:54:42.830 --> 02:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
trafficking especially with internet
 
02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
especially with kids having their phones
 
02:54:47.389 --> 02:54:47.399 align:start position:0%
and being able to get online and meet up
 
02:54:49.389 --> 02:54:49.399 align:start position:0%
with people and stuff we will make
 
02:54:52.389 --> 02:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
ourselves a very attractive state for
 
02:54:54.510 --> 02:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
child traffickers to come so even though
 
02:54:56.110 --> 02:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen that yet that's
 
02:54:58.110 --> 02:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
something to keep in mind when we are
 
02:54:59.830 --> 02:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
one of the only islands on this
 
02:55:01.630 --> 02:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
particular matter so I will be voting
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
for this for a million different reasons
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
but that's an added one thank
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
Nelson um I'm feeling ambivalent right
 
02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
now one way or the other but my concern
 
02:55:17.309 --> 02:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
is that um is
 
02:55:17.319 --> 02:55:19.030 align:start position:0%
is that um is
this

02:55:19.030 --> 02:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:55:24.030 --> 02:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
we have such a larger problem with um
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
human trafficking sex trafficking of
 
02:55:30.510 --> 02:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
minors and raising the age of marriage
 
02:55:33.429 --> 02:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
to 18 is not going to solve that and
 
02:55:36.670 --> 02:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
also in demestic violent situations of
 
02:55:38.590 --> 02:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
minors who are
 
02:55:42.269 --> 02:55:42.279 align:start position:0%
cohabitating so I am hoping that my
 
02:55:44.790 --> 02:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues will join
 
02:55:47.790 --> 02:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
me should we be reelected next time to
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
actually address the real problem that
 
02:55:54.469 --> 02:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
you well my comment is uh when I was
 
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
young I visited my family in rural
 
02:56:05.469 --> 02:56:05.479 align:start position:0%
Canada a little town called pearsonville
 
02:56:05.479 --> 02:56:06.389 align:start position:0%
Canada a little town called pearsonville
New

02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
Brunswick and at 14 people were
 
02:56:12.670 --> 02:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
responsible they did not have
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
adolescence you grew up quickly because
 
02:56:18.950 --> 02:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
the cow had to be milked the absence of
 
02:56:20.510 --> 02:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
Which is far more serious than you
 
02:56:22.389 --> 02:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
didn't take out the trash every other
 
02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
day and I noticed my cousins in Canada
 
02:56:30.750 --> 02:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
were because of this much more mature
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so to get married at 15 and 16 was
 
02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
not a maturity
 
02:56:40.150 --> 02:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
problem well that's not the people I see
 
02:56:44.190 --> 02:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
everywhere else I go even in rural
 
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
Canada as a result what might have been
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay there 60 years ago I do not believe
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
is okay here now and so I will be voting
 
02:57:01.030 --> 02:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:57:04.349 --> 02:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
bill anyone else yes representative
 
02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson um I
 
02:57:09.150 --> 02:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
will admit that I voted against this
 
02:57:11.910 --> 02:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill last year however um times have
 
02:57:15.229 --> 02:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
changed in a very short period of time
 
02:57:19.349 --> 02:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm very concerned that a same-sex
 
02:57:22.070 --> 02:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
marriage is required to be 18 but we're
 
02:57:23.910 --> 02:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
not providing those same protections to
 
02:57:27.110 --> 02:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
the young women in our state um I will
 
02:57:30.510 --> 02:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:33.429 --> 02:57:33.439 align:start position:0%

02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
last year I was very vocal about this
 
02:57:46.269 --> 02:57:46.279 align:start position:0%
bill um supporting RAC and data age 28
 
02:57:50.389 --> 02:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
um have life experience with
 
02:57:58.750 --> 02:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
um basically um I was only 15 years old
 
02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
and my ex-husband he was 47 years
 
02:58:05.389 --> 02:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
old um and someone who didn't know the
 
02:58:08.070 --> 02:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
language uh someone who didn't know the
 
02:58:12.429 --> 02:58:12.439 align:start position:0%
rights um I had 11 years
 
02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
of trauma pain and um
 
02:58:21.150 --> 02:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
struggles um and I don't wish anyone
 
02:58:24.229 --> 02:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
because those scars um even though that
 
02:58:27.150 --> 02:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
I feel like I heal um they're going to
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
be there for the rest of my life um and
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
I don't wish anyone not even my worst
 
02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:36.000 align:start position:0%

attorney's office I've been a prosecutor
 
03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years now um just to not
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
reiterate what Senator Carson said but
 
03:47:58.870 --> 03:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
essentially this bill um in 2017 the age
 
03:48:00.590 --> 03:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
for entry into the criminal justice
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
system was raised from 17 to 18 years
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
old and there were a number of statutes
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
that were sort of lagging behind that
 
03:48:09.349 --> 03:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
didn't get changed this goes back looks
 
03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
at those statutes and changes the age to
 
03:48:14.910 --> 03:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
18 so that everything is aligned now and
 
03:48:20.070 --> 03:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:21.790 --> 03:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
questions I was going to say there was
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
also a handout that the
 
03:48:27.550 --> 03:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
handout around that has everyone who
 
03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:31.279 align:start position:0%

03:48:43.349 --> 03:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:46.670 --> 03:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
much no other pink
 
03:48:49.389 --> 03:48:49.399 align:start position:0%
cards so therefore I conclude the
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 506
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%

last time I testified and said this is a
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
housekeeping thing two hours later it
 
03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:04.920 align:start position:0%

03:55:31.229 --> 03:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
13 basically what the the added language
 
03:55:35.070 --> 03:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
aligns with the child protection act of
 
03:55:37.590 --> 03:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
169c uh pertaining to the placement
 
03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
options uh for children that is
 
03:55:41.870 --> 03:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal law the family
 
03:55:45.110 --> 03:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
first Prevention Services Act of
 
03:55:47.950 --> 03:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
2017 which allows for not just relative
 
03:55:51.870 --> 03:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
caregivers but Kinship Caregivers to uh
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
be a placement option for children not
 
03:55:56.950 --> 03:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
just with uh CPA with the child
 
03:55:59.269 --> 03:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
protection act but for children involved
 
03:56:01.269 --> 03:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
with the juvenile justice system in both
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
the delinquency and shins act and that
 
03:56:06.349 --> 03:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
language of adding kinship would be
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
aligning with that with both federal and
 
03:56:10.950 --> 03:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
state law as well as adding the
 
03:56:12.990 --> 03:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
placement options of certified
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
residential or psychiatric placements
 
03:56:17.189 --> 03:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
that is also part of the children
 
03:56:17.199 --> 03:56:18.790 align:start position:0%
that is also part of the children
protection

03:56:18.790 --> 03:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
act uh secondly on page two uh section
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
five which is lines 1 through 14 will be
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
amending the reporting dates of the
 
03:56:32.149 --> 03:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
Youth Detention Center logs uh those
 
03:56:34.710 --> 03:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
reports go to the department um of
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services uh by anually
 
03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the way it's stated in the statute
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
now the dates of reporting are uh
 
03:56:47.110 --> 03:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
January 1st and July 1st we request that
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
the bill be amended as the language
 
03:56:52.590 --> 03:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
dates in Senate Bill 498 to align itself
 
03:56:55.149 --> 03:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
with the federal reporting dates of the
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice delinquency prevention
 
03:56:59.590 --> 03:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
act which would change the dates uh
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
reporting to October 1st and April 1st
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
and lastly uh this bill on page three
 
03:57:10.670 --> 03:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
which is uh section 10 of the bill uh
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
lines 14 through 19 this bill would
 
03:57:19.950 --> 03:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
repeal the perspective repeal of the
 
03:57:22.229 --> 03:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
section uh known as the rebuttable
 
03:57:24.990 --> 03:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm that went into
 
03:57:26.510 --> 03:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
effect in
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
2021 with House Bill 1162 that had a
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
sunset provision of July 1st of this
 
03:57:37.429 --> 03:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
year of 2024 so this bill would be
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
repealing the repeal of that sunset
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
provision we have asked for that because
 
03:57:45.590 --> 03:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
we find that the rebuttable presumption
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
of harm is a very important evidentiary
 
03:57:51.910 --> 03:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
tool it is trauma informed with all that
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
we know about Early Childhood adverse
 
03:57:58.229 --> 03:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
effects it does not change the
 
03:58:00.550 --> 03:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
definition of neglect that's why it's an
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
evidentiary tool under 169
 
03:58:06.389 --> 03:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
C12 the definition of neglect Remains
 
03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:09.399 align:start position:0%
the Same it's a two-prong definition in
 
03:58:14.189 --> 03:58:14.199 align:start position:0%
which a child is a neglected child is a
 
03:58:17.469 --> 03:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
who is without proper care necessary for
 
03:58:20.510 --> 03:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
the child's physical mental or emotional
 
03:58:23.189 --> 03:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
well-being and then that second prong is
 
03:58:25.469 --> 03:58:25.479 align:start position:0%
that when it is established that a child
 
03:58:28.110 --> 03:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
has suffered serious impairment or is
 
03:58:31.550 --> 03:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
likely to suffer serious impairment I
 
03:58:33.389 --> 03:58:33.399 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a mouthful and there's
 
03:58:35.670 --> 03:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
many elements involved with uh what
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
factors uh the court is to consider when
 
03:58:40.269 --> 03:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
looking at serious
 
03:58:42.790 --> 03:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
impairments and the Supreme Court has
 
03:58:45.550 --> 03:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
has simplified it to be harm harm to a
 
03:58:49.349 --> 03:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
child or potential harm to a child and
 
03:58:51.550 --> 03:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
that's the hard part sometimes in court
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
because that's not in line with what we
 
03:58:56.630 --> 03:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
know about Early Childhood adverse
 
03:59:00.269 --> 03:59:00.279 align:start position:0%
effects and that harm occurred but it
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
may not immediately manifest itself it
 
03:59:05.229 --> 03:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
may not be readily a parent to a child
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
who has been exposed to certain
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
situation and experiences in their home
 
03:59:10.000 --> 03:59:10.910 align:start position:0%
situation and experiences in their home
and

03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
therefore that would prevent sometimes
 
03:59:15.590 --> 03:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
the state from acting from
 
03:59:18.670 --> 03:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
intervening or delay intervention
 
03:59:21.389 --> 03:59:21.399 align:start position:0%
waiting for that harm to manifest itself
 
03:59:23.110 --> 03:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
and that's not in line what what we all
 
03:59:26.590 --> 03:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
as a society know about Early Childhood
 
03:59:29.590 --> 03:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
adverse effects and therefore four years
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
ago as my understand that the
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
legislature heard testimony from many
 
03:59:36.990 --> 03:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
entities including um a review of the
 
03:59:40.229 --> 03:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
federal review of cases that were not uh
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
acted upon and saw that consistently
 
03:59:44.389 --> 03:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
those were the ones that were considered
 
03:59:47.389 --> 03:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
to be exposure cases when children were
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
exposed to certain conditions in the
 
03:59:53.229 --> 03:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
home and those conditions put them at
 
03:59:56.269 --> 03:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
risk of serious impairment so therefore
 
03:59:59.229 --> 03:59:59.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1162 which is a lot of great
 
04:00:02.309 --> 04:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
things for child welfare it finally
 
04:00:05.590 --> 04:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
defined psychological melt treatment it
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
finally included a stepparent as a
 
04:00:12.990 --> 04:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
parent of a child and it included four
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumptions of harm in which
 
04:00:19.149 --> 04:00:19.159 align:start position:0%
the court may make a finding that a
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
child has been harmed a rebuttable
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
presumption that this child has been
 
04:00:26.149 --> 04:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
harmed unless and until proven otherwise
 
04:00:28.750 --> 04:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
to certain exposure cases and that is
 
04:00:30.870 --> 04:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
when a child is exposed to substance
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
misuse in the home that is adversely
 
04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
affecting the care of the child when a
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
child is exposed to driving while
 
04:00:41.590 --> 04:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
intoxicated by being in the car with a
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
parent who is driving while impaired
 
04:00:47.550 --> 04:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
three when a child is exposed to
 
04:00:50.670 --> 04:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
physical violence in the home by the
 
04:00:53.229 --> 04:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
parent the parent is either physically
 
04:00:55.309 --> 04:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh violent towards another child in the
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
home or another adult in the home and
 
04:01:01.070 --> 04:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
that child is exposed to that and lastly
 
04:01:03.870 --> 04:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
when a child is exposed to psychological
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
melt treatment either they themselves
 
04:01:08.149 --> 04:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
are the victim of psychological melt
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
treatment or they are exposed to psych
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
psychological melt treatment in the home
 
04:01:16.149 --> 04:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
to another adult or another child in the
 
04:01:18.469 --> 04:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
home and that is a very important
 
04:01:20.670 --> 04:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
evidentiary tool that we hope with the
 
04:01:23.110 --> 04:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill uh that you pass
 
04:01:26.309 --> 04:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
this bill to repeal the repeal of that
 
04:01:28.510 --> 04:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
those rebuttable presumptions of
 
04:01:30.990 --> 04:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
harm and I will be happy to answer any
 
04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill under those
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
four three of them are very discreet
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
situations but I question about
 
04:01:43.149 --> 04:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
psychological maltreatment how broadly
 
04:01:45.990 --> 04:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
could that be for example the child
 
04:01:49.550 --> 04:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
really wants something and the parent
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
parents for whatever reason do not
 
04:01:54.790 --> 04:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
believe that the child should have that
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're talking major things um would
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
that be considered psychological
 
04:02:02.790 --> 04:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
maltreatment and the child could say I
 
04:02:05.710 --> 04:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to have tattoos and my parents
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
forbad me and because of that I am
 
04:02:11.309 --> 04:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
suffering uh to me psychological
 
04:02:15.469 --> 04:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
maltreatment could be could be runaway
 
04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
if I may with House Bill 1162 the
 
04:02:20.229 --> 04:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
definition of psychological melt
 
04:02:22.790 --> 04:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
treatment was added to the definition
 
04:02:27.269 --> 04:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
section of 169 C3 and if you could give
 
04:02:30.389 --> 04:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
me a moment I believe I did bring the
 
04:02:33.229 --> 04:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
actual statute with me well if you
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.840 --> 04:02:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
04:02:48.950 --> 04:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
I can go so before I joined DCF as a as
 
04:02:51.790 --> 04:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
a uh general counsel I worked for UNH
 
04:02:55.670 --> 04:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
and I was um a trainer and after 1162
 
04:02:57.469 --> 04:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
was passed it included the provision
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
that all DCF and other stakeholders be
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
trained on House Bill 1162 and I was
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
actually a trainer of that so I will
 
04:03:07.469 --> 04:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
refer to my PRI previous notes on the
 
04:03:09.149 --> 04:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
trainings that were some years ago so
 
04:03:12.750 --> 04:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:12.760 --> 04:03:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
definition

04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.720 --> 04:03:50.110 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:03:50.110 --> 04:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:53.149 --> 04:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
it defines psycle the law the statute of
 
04:03:55.149 --> 04:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
1162 added to the definition of
 
04:03:56.670 --> 04:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
psychological Mel treatment and was
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
added into the law of pervasive and
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
emotionally abusive Behavior which shall
 
04:04:04.830 --> 04:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
include but not be limited to patterns
 
04:04:08.349 --> 04:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
of threatening berating or demeaning
 
04:04:11.149 --> 04:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
Behavior so it's a course of conduct of
 
04:04:13.950 --> 04:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
behavior that is threatening berating or
 
04:04:16.189 --> 04:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
demeaning parents being parents and
 
04:04:18.110 --> 04:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
saying no you cannot do that would not
 
04:04:20.670 --> 04:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
fall under any of those unless the
 
04:04:23.630 --> 04:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
language used and so it becomes a
 
04:04:26.070 --> 04:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
berating language or physical
 
04:04:28.349 --> 04:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
threatening language correct because as
 
04:04:31.070 --> 04:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
we know uh you know emotional abuse and
 
04:04:33.389 --> 04:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
words have sometimes a lot more effects
 
04:04:35.229 --> 04:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
on a child than oh sure but sometimes
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
saying no a child can perceive that
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
course of course and that's why I think
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
um you all if anyone was present during
 
04:04:43.870 --> 04:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
the house bill 1162 took all that in
 
04:04:46.149 --> 04:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
consideration and talked about pervasive
 
04:04:48.510 --> 04:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
and emotionally abusive Behavior yeah I
 
04:04:50.309 --> 04:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
was a co-sponsor to that so I just want
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure I didn't uh you know open
 
04:04:55.790 --> 04:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
up something representative D
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so when I
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
raised my children I had a sign on the
 
04:05:06.389 --> 04:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
refrigerator that I replaced frequently
 
04:05:08.110 --> 04:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
because I had to get the Jelly stains
 
04:05:12.550 --> 04:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
off and it said um Sticks and Stones can
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
break your bones but where can break
 
04:05:14.159 --> 04:05:15.269 align:start position:0%
break your bones but where can break
your

04:05:15.269 --> 04:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:05:17.550 --> 04:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
heart and I always said to the children
 
04:05:20.149 --> 04:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
be careful how you speak to somebody so
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
I found
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
it diff difficult for myself when I
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
reported somebody for calling their
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
child an effing moronic
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
idiot and when I reported it as abuse I
 
04:05:38.830 --> 04:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
was told sorry so it seems like this
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill am I correct that this bill will
 
04:05:44.550 --> 04:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
make a corrective action in in that
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
aspect when you're constantly verbally
 
04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
berating and telling a child that they
 
04:05:53.550 --> 04:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
are not what they what you are telling
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
them they
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
are exactly because it's patterns of
 
04:05:58.950 --> 04:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
threatening berading or demeaning
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
Behavior so in the court of law that' be
 
04:06:03.269 --> 04:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
very hard to prove that a child has been
 
04:06:05.710 --> 04:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
harmed without this rebuttable
 
04:06:08.830 --> 04:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
harm time thank you representative
 
04:06:14.429 --> 04:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:06:15.670 --> 04:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my call do you have
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
um why um what was the sorry I'm What
 
04:06:26.149 --> 04:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
would I'm just like wondering it's
 
04:06:29.309 --> 04:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
baffling what was the reason for uh the
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
repeal of
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
that that's a good question I don't know
 
04:06:36.030 --> 04:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
actually the origin of why it has sunset
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
provision in it um I know that these
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption of harms the four
 
04:06:44.590 --> 04:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
of them replace the opioid um rebuttable
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
presumption that had a sunset so I don't
 
04:06:50.149 --> 04:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
know if that's why it was replacing
 
04:06:53.070 --> 04:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
another provision that did Sunset but
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
other than that I would be only
 
04:06:56.040 --> 04:06:58.149 align:start position:0%
other than that I would be only
guessing

04:06:58.149 --> 04:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
guessing
 
04:07:00.750 --> 04:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
question um I actually wanted to just go
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
back to um the first and second parts of
 
04:07:09.710 --> 04:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
the bills can you just um explain
 
04:07:12.070 --> 04:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
fictive Ken and what that legal
 
04:07:14.309 --> 04:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
definition is for us just because it's
 
04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
something new since I worked at DCF
 
04:07:16.439 --> 04:07:17.710 align:start position:0%
something new since I worked at DCF
years

04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
ago I can uh fictive kin is defined in
 
04:07:28.750 --> 04:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
17025 Roman numeral 8 in which kin means
 
04:07:31.950 --> 04:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
a child means a child or children who
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
for which there is a connection or
 
04:07:36.670 --> 04:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
history between a child or their parents
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
and another responsible adult including
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
but not in not limited to a relative or
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
related adult so it's someone known to
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
the child it can be a relative but it
 
04:07:48.030 --> 04:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a relative it can be
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
a coach it can be a teacher it can be a
 
04:07:55.990 --> 04:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.000 --> 04:07:58.189 align:start position:0%
 
great

04:07:58.189 --> 04:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
right the yes representative
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson thank
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
you for your time and coming to answer
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
our questions
 
04:08:11.790 --> 04:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
um there's something about this that's
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
just not sitting right with me
 
04:08:16.590 --> 04:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
um at the current moment because you're
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
saying threatening berating and
 
04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
demeaning which is which are all very
 
04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
subjective which means we're placing our
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
values on another family without even
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
the evidence that there is harm being
 
04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
done I know that I understand that over
 
04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
the long run you know children we all
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
have stories about what our parents
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
might have done to us um but I'm
 
04:08:39.389 --> 04:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
concerned and I'm just wondering how
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
does this
 
04:08:43.389 --> 04:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
fit um when you talk about psychologic
 
04:08:43.399 --> 04:08:46.030 align:start position:0%
fit um when you talk about psychologic
iCal

04:08:46.030 --> 04:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
maltreatment where does parents that
 
04:08:51.990 --> 04:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
have diagnosed mental illness of by
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
maybe borderline personality or bipolar
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
disorder is this going to
 
04:09:01.630 --> 04:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
unfairly impact them because that's how
 
04:09:03.229 --> 04:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
they could tend to treat their children
 
04:09:04.830 --> 04:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
with a lot of threatening behavior or
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
Bering or um especially with a B one
 
04:09:09.550 --> 04:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
minute they're they're happy go-lucky
 
04:09:10.910 --> 04:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
parents and the next minute they're
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
screaming at their children so I'm just
 
04:09:14.830 --> 04:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
wondering how is this going to affect
 
04:09:17.950 --> 04:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
our community that is diagnosed and is
 
04:09:20.229 --> 04:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
that going to stop people from getting
 
04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
from getting help for their um mental
 
04:09:22.560 --> 04:09:24.269 align:start position:0%
from getting help for their um mental
health

04:09:24.269 --> 04:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:09:26.349 --> 04:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
issues thank you for the question well
 
04:09:28.510 --> 04:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
first of all it's twofold the rebuttable
 
04:09:31.630 --> 04:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm is applying
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
psychological Mel treatment that
 
04:09:36.229 --> 04:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
definition is is defined in the
 
04:09:40.870 --> 04:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
definition section of 169 C3 and that is
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
not part of the repeal the repeal is the
 
04:09:45.790 --> 04:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption of harm and again
 
04:09:47.710 --> 04:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
it's a rebuttable presumption it's not
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
an irrebuttable presumption of harm so
 
04:09:53.149 --> 04:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
if there's testimony that the parent was
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um calling a child a a
 
04:09:59.790 --> 04:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
derogatory name in terms of calling them
 
04:10:02.349 --> 04:10:02.359 align:start position:0%
uh obese and what that means to be
 
04:10:04.030 --> 04:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
calling them obese and did certain
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
actions because they called them obese
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
or uh did other forms of emotional abuse
 
04:10:12.189 --> 04:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
that's a rebuttable presumption it's not
 
04:10:12.199 --> 04:10:13.349 align:start position:0%
that's a rebuttable presumption it's not
irrebuttable

04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
irrebuttable
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
until unless proven otherwise it just
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
makes it easier to prove harm but it's
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
not saying it is harm in and of
 
04:10:23.550 --> 04:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
itself followup follow
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
up so just to to make sure I'm getting
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
this clear so I understand that it's a
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
rebuttable but it's also presenting an
 
04:10:34.030 --> 04:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for parents to go after each
 
04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
other in making claims against the other
 
04:10:39.870 --> 04:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
parent for what they would perceive as
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
mistreatment or um I'm just I guess I'm
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about the subjectiveness of
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
it of especially when it's something
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
that you're not seeing it's just
 
04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
something maybe I wouldn't particularly
 
04:10:55.550 --> 04:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
raise my children doing it one way so
 
04:10:57.870 --> 04:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to understand and square
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
this whole thing is how do
 
04:11:03.309 --> 04:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
we one is how do you prove it but also
 
04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
how do you disprove an
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
allegation well I think you have to also
 
04:11:09.670 --> 04:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
start the foundation of that all
 
04:11:12.389 --> 04:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
evidence in court has to be material
 
04:11:15.870 --> 04:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
reliable and found to be credible for it
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
to be found to even apply the rebble
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm so typically say for
 
04:11:23.429 --> 04:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
instance if there's a child who goes to
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
the Child Advocacy Center and has a
 
04:11:28.990 --> 04:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
forensic interview in which the child
 
04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
describes acts of the parent that is
 
04:11:34.349 --> 04:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
emotionally abusive and berading and
 
04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
that is evidence that's material
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
evidence it's reliable evidence it's
 
04:11:39.870 --> 04:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
credible evidence that the state would
 
04:11:42.630 --> 04:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
put into evidence during an abuse and
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
neglect action for psychological
 
04:11:47.870 --> 04:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
maltreatment and that evidence is
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
weighed by the judge so doesn't doesn't
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
shange like I said before it doesn't
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
first it doesn't change the um evidence
 
04:11:58.910 --> 04:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
of putting in reliable credible evidence
 
04:12:00.910 --> 04:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's just that once that evidence is
 
04:12:03.790 --> 04:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
ruled to be reliable and
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
credible uh admissible evidence then the
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
judge weighs that with the evidentiary
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
tool of a rebuttable presumption of harm
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
the chair welcomes Attorney John
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
Williams to where he is now seated and
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much chairman uh for
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
the record my name is John Williams I'm
 
04:12:23.870 --> 04:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative director for Health
 
04:12:25.710 --> 04:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
Human Services and just here to
 
04:12:27.429 --> 04:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
compliment the testimony that's being
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
provided to you very astute uh testimony
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
um from attorney larby uh I actually was
 
04:12:34.870 --> 04:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
involved with the underlying Bill
 
04:12:36.269 --> 04:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
working with many of you on the
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee that dealt with the rebuttable
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
presumption around harm what I wanted to
 
04:12:42.510 --> 04:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
clarify particularly for you represent
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
Paul that is actually currently in law
 
04:12:46.750 --> 04:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
today and the reason the sunset
 
04:12:49.109 --> 04:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
provision was placed into the bill was
 
04:12:50.590 --> 04:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
primarily at the request of the
 
04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
pediatricians in from Dartmouth and
 
04:12:54.269 --> 04:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
other areas because they were concerned
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
about the perhaps chilling effect that
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
would have in terms of reporting uh in
 
04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
cases where a parent might have a
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
subance a subance use um matter and so
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
we have worked with a very collaborat
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
you heard from attorney larby about the
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
training that we've done for the
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation to making sure that we're
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
very sensitive because we want people to
 
04:13:15.550 --> 04:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
address their subance use issues and
 
04:13:17.109 --> 04:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
also we want to make sure that kids are
 
04:13:18.269 --> 04:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
safe and I think we've done a really
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
good job balancing the the um whole
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
perspective of the current law now the
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
sunset was put in here specifically for
 
04:13:27.389 --> 04:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
this to be Road tested and I'm not
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
saying because you don't hear clamors of
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people behind us that that
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
is evidence because that's kind of lack
 
04:13:35.790 --> 04:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
of evidence uh but it is an occasion
 
04:13:38.309 --> 04:13:38.319 align:start position:0%
where this has been rot tested and gone
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
through the process and that's why we're
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
here today to request this committee to
 
04:13:44.189 --> 04:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
remove the sunset provision again the
 
04:13:45.990 --> 04:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
issues that you're you're discussing are
 
04:13:48.189 --> 04:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
in current law there not this is nothing
 
04:13:49.790 --> 04:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
new that this bill is trying to do it's
 
04:13:52.830 --> 04:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
just eliminating the sunset provision in
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
the law because it is working and it is
 
04:13:56.510 --> 04:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
protecting kids and if it isn't working
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the future you will certainly have
 
04:13:59.630 --> 04:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
folks coming before you seeking other
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
changes of law but we're not trying to
 
04:14:03.309 --> 04:14:03.319 align:start position:0%
change at all and I'll repeat we're not
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
trying to change at all the current
 
04:14:06.309 --> 04:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
provisions of the law as it relates to
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
the um rebuttable uh proof of harm so
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
attorney lar
 
04:14:13.950 --> 04:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
anything I have a question and um some
 
04:14:17.070 --> 04:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
of you may remember house bill
 
04:14:20.830 --> 04:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
1573 which was about outplacement of
 
04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
children who needed to be placed
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere and there
 
04:14:29.070 --> 04:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
was there were hours upon hours upon
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
hours of work that went into that by the
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate and
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
and one poor legislator who really
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
wonders um please tell me that this
 
04:14:48.510 --> 04:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
498 is in is in a different place it is
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
not um dealing with 1573 or it's Senate
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
cousin I think it's 417 this is uh
 
04:14:59.590 --> 04:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
something different
 
04:15:03.309 --> 04:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
correct thank you yeah and and I don't
 
04:15:05.389 --> 04:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
say the same word uh chairman that you
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
also say about certain types of bills
 
04:15:08.790 --> 04:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
and I probably met a couple of your
 
04:15:10.389 --> 04:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
folks returning from lunch that I did
 
04:15:12.750 --> 04:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
this uh this truly is one of those bills
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
that were coming back again the fredkin
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
very helpful pieces around Family First
 
04:15:20.429 --> 04:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
putting that into legislation changing a
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
the date for reporting for detention
 
04:15:26.670 --> 04:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
from January 1st to October uh are the
 
04:15:27.990 --> 04:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
periods that we had under the federal
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then finally just seeking not any
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
change to current law as it relates to
 
04:15:33.550 --> 04:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
rebuttal Pro of harm but just uh
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
addressing the sunset provision if we do
 
04:15:37.309 --> 04:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
if you do nothing here today what will
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
end up happening is that it is scheduled
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
a sunset on June 30th of of this year
 
04:15:44.349 --> 04:15:44.359 align:start position:0%
and so that's are here very thoughtfully
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
to saying it's working it's been Road
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
tested and if there's any other changes
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
needed people will come to you our only
 
04:15:53.710 --> 04:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
goal here is to address the sunset
 
04:15:58.429 --> 04:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
further thank you counselor and thank
 
04:16:03.790 --> 04:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
you counselor thank you all thank you
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
this now ends the hearing on Senate Bill
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
498 and uh we're done we're done where
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
was the
 
04:16:11.920 --> 04:16:15.149 align:start position:0%
was the
card

04:16:15.149 --> 04:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.109 --> 04:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's not the
 
04:16:19.630 --> 04:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
point the question is we usually have
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
the cards do you have something you want
 
04:16:20.960 --> 04:16:22.229 align:start position:0%
the cards do you have something you want
to

04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:16:34.750 --> 04:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%

come to speak to you about my concern
 
04:16:59.469 --> 04:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
about um one particular phrase that is
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
included in here fictive kin um my
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
concern around that is as I was looking
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
through the statutes I know it was
 
04:17:08.030 --> 04:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
referenced but I did not find it in our
 
04:17:12.189 --> 04:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
existing statutes and I also um am just
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
quite concerned
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of placing
 
04:17:18.550 --> 04:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
children with somebody who may not may
 
04:17:20.550 --> 04:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
have an inappropriate relationship with
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
them and maybe in a position of
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
authority um my mother was a public
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
school teacher and um the only way that
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
they found out that there was a teacher
 
04:17:33.469 --> 04:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
who had Decades of inappropriate
 
04:17:35.630 --> 04:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
relationships with children was after
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
the teacher's lounge was vandalized in a
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
horrific way because the same thing had
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
happened to one Boy's brother that had
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
happened to him
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
until that day that teacher was well-
 
04:17:47.950 --> 04:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
loved and well respected but they found
 
04:17:49.149 --> 04:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
out that there had been a pattern of
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
abuse over decades um my concern is
 
04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
simply around the fictive kin I
 
04:17:56.149 --> 04:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
recognize the need to make sure that
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
there are people who are important to a
 
04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
child who are involved when I first
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
heard about this I asked what's fic of
 
04:18:05.149 --> 04:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
King kin oh that must be Uncle Mike my
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
husband's best friend from growing up
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
who is the one who will be raising our
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
children should something happen to us
 
04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and we have that in documentation I
 
04:18:17.109 --> 04:18:17.119 align:start position:0%
know not everybody else does but my
 
04:18:19.790 --> 04:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
caution here is that there are people
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
who are involved in children's lives
 
04:18:24.189 --> 04:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
there's one from my town who had been um
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
an assistant at a school and she has
 
04:18:28.149 --> 04:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
another parole hearing coming up she had
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
an inappropriate relationship with one
 
04:18:31.710 --> 04:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
of the students what if he had been
 
04:18:33.870 --> 04:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
placed in that house um the horrors that
 
04:18:35.590 --> 04:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
had happened there would have been even
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
worse so I just some caution on
 
04:18:40.229 --> 04:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
expanding the ease of placement in
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
fictive kin because you know I i' say
 
04:18:43.319 --> 04:18:45.189 align:start position:0%
fictive kin because you know I i' say
probably

04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:18:47.790 --> 04:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
99,999 out of 10,000 people who would be
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
in that situation are good but we need
 
04:18:53.469 --> 04:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
to be sure that that balance of power
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
and the potential for an inappropriate
 
04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
relationship with somebody in a position
 
04:18:59.550 --> 04:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
of power isn't something that moves a
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
child from the frying pan Into the
 
04:19:05.149 --> 04:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
Fire any questions for vice chair Leon
 
04:19:05.159 --> 04:19:06.469 align:start position:0%
Fire any questions for vice chair Leon
representative

04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:08.910 --> 04:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um Do You
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
Believe that there are also um people
 
04:19:17.710 --> 04:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
who are relatives and
 
04:19:21.950 --> 04:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
Guardians um who also are abusers and
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's already inlaw that they would
 
04:19:27.750 --> 04:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
be able to be responsible for this
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
child's care yes and that was one of the
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
challenges and tragedies that faces
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
especially this committee dealing with
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
those difficulties because you can't you
 
04:19:39.950 --> 04:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
need to treat everybody fairly and
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's bad people that are
 
04:19:44.429 --> 04:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
able to disguise how they act act um and
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
it's the challenge if this was easy all
 
04:19:48.510 --> 04:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
these kids would be safe um and I
 
04:19:50.030 --> 04:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
commend you guys for everything you do
 
04:19:52.510 --> 04:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
in order to protect children followup
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:00.670 --> 04:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
um with that being said I think it's
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
logical that um we would have to treat
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
everybody in in uh this presly in
 
04:20:09.870 --> 04:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
statute and also fictive kin in the same
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
way um in order to uh vet them equally
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
because we would have to um view all of
 
04:20:22.030 --> 04:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
them as a you know potentially either
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
very good equally or harmfully
 
04:20:28.269 --> 04:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
potentially um so how would you like
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
what what would be the difference in
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
vetting those two types of people well
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um I I
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
recognize the vetting process is
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
challenging it's something that actually
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
is probably worth some evaluation and to
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
see what that vetting process is and to
 
04:20:44.910 --> 04:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that in certain situations
 
04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
it's not fast-tracked just because of a
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
good feeling about somebody um that's
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
something that I promise I'll look into
 
04:20:53.469 --> 04:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
and see if there's something that can be
 
04:20:56.189 --> 04:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
done in terms of that however the more
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
that we open this up to to additional
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
people the more that the the more
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities for problems there are yet
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
I also understand we don't want to be
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
putting children into homes we don't
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
want to be shipping them out of state we
 
04:21:10.750 --> 04:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to be putting them somewhere
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
else but we need to ignore a knowledge
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
the fact that there can be um
 
04:21:15.279 --> 04:21:17.189 align:start position:0%
the fact that there can be um
inappropriate

04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
relationships representative Raymond
 
04:21:21.790 --> 04:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my question is
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
actually for you Mr chairman can we ask
 
04:21:28.590 --> 04:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
um DCF what or the representatives from
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS what the vetting process is for
 
04:21:34.109 --> 04:21:34.119 align:start position:0%
placement with um people who aren't
 
04:21:35.790 --> 04:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
certified foster homes or certified
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
placement representative I was just
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
about to do that oh thank you so thank
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
you for seconding that because I I think
 
04:21:46.189 --> 04:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
the Representative makes a good
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
point thank you if you're done with me
 
04:21:49.750 --> 04:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
I'll step away from here thank you for
 
04:21:53.750 --> 04:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
hearing me Cher Le on nothing thank you
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you now how about representative
 
04:21:57.439 --> 04:21:59.550 align:start position:0%
thank you now how about representative
Raymond's

04:21:59.550 --> 04:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
Raymond's
 
04:22:02.950 --> 04:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
question you're it guys you too you're
 
04:22:07.830 --> 04:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
you represent all 4800 DC uh DHHS
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
employees well thank you um yeah so back
 
04:22:14.349 --> 04:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
in 2022 k ship Care Homes were added to
 
04:22:17.429 --> 04:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
the definition of foster care um uh
 
04:22:19.870 --> 04:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
facilities uh kinship Care Home Means A
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
type of foster home in which an
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
individual or individuals are licensed
 
04:22:26.269 --> 04:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
to provide care exclusively to Kin and
 
04:22:28.389 --> 04:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
then like I said before kin is defined
 
04:22:30.349 --> 04:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
as I read that definition earlier uh
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
there shall be a maximum of six children
 
04:22:35.790 --> 04:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
in the home and children uh and children
 
04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
receive for child care who are related
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the residents um those six other
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
people uh we are currently in a contract
 
04:22:45.149 --> 04:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
with um an organization called a a
 
04:22:48.189 --> 04:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
second chance they are the ones that are
 
04:22:51.750 --> 04:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
licensing uh these kinship Care Homes um
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
so once they are licensed they are able
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
to receive foster care payments because
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
that was the hurdle that many uh
 
04:23:00.510 --> 04:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
relatives and fictive kin were being
 
04:23:03.630 --> 04:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
vetted but were unable to receive foster
 
04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
care payments and maintenance for the
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
care of these children so based on the
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
changes to the statute in
 
04:23:14.910 --> 04:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
2022 these kin homes will be are LIC are
 
04:23:16.830 --> 04:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
being licensed and will continue to be
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
licensed and during that licensing
 
04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
process there's obviously a an
 
04:23:24.269 --> 04:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
application of vetting um a home study
 
04:23:27.070 --> 04:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
um a study uh background checks and and
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
all that goes into um making sure that
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
the child is placed in a safe and
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate home that is with someone
 
04:23:35.439 --> 04:23:36.630 align:start position:0%
appropriate home that is with someone
they

04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:23:39.990 --> 04:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
know follow up thank you Mr chairman so
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
in so what happens when there's an
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
emergency or even in in this case where
 
04:23:47.149 --> 04:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
a delinquency has happened and a child
 
04:23:47.159 --> 04:23:48.309 align:start position:0%
a delinquency has happened and a child
needs

04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:23:50.830 --> 04:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
placement do they have to go to a group
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
home while the you know the you know
 
04:23:55.750 --> 04:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
Uncle Mike or whomever is being vetted
 
04:23:57.950 --> 04:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
through the vetting process or can they
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
go there like on a conditional basis
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
while the my understanding again my
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
understanding is I'm not the subject
 
04:24:06.870 --> 04:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
matter expert at this but this is my
 
04:24:08.590 --> 04:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
understanding working on the uh
 
04:24:10.790 --> 04:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
licensing process with kinship Care
 
04:24:13.109 --> 04:24:13.119 align:start position:0%
Homes is that there certain things that
 
04:24:16.109 --> 04:24:16.119 align:start position:0%
are called day one non-negotiables that
 
04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
have to be done that day one to in order
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
to place um uh child with the uncle and
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
that uncle has to have a background
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
check which would require the uh cpsw to
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
call the local PDS to come in observe
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
the home do a walkth through of the home
 
04:24:37.670 --> 04:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
and answer ask and be answered uh
 
04:24:40.030 --> 04:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
certain non-negotiable questions

Betty gay from Salem and I'm going to uh

try to IM give a example of what
 
04:25:36.309 --> 04:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson referred to I had
 
04:25:40.229 --> 04:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
never heard of fictive kin until January
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
when a person who I now I can't name
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
them because it does involve a child but
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
a person that you've heard many times so
 
04:25:50.269 --> 04:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
you'd have respect for had a child
 
04:25:52.990 --> 04:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
15-year-old knock on her door and ask if
 
04:25:55.550 --> 04:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
she could have a drink of water she had
 
04:25:57.630 --> 04:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
been walking
 
04:26:01.149 --> 04:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
from she'd been walking a long time
 
04:26:04.349 --> 04:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
turns out everybody at school and the
 
04:26:07.590 --> 04:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
police knew this child's
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
situation the person abusing her was her
 
04:26:11.640 --> 04:26:14.189 align:start position:0%
situation the person abusing her was her
aunts

04:26:14.189 --> 04:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
aunts
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
husband so she could have been there but
 
04:26:19.710 --> 04:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
thank goodness for fictive kin this
 
04:26:22.830 --> 04:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
person who home she just decided to walk
 
04:26:25.229 --> 04:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
up to cuz it looked like a place people
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
came to they had a sign out front
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
um this child the school knew the
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
situation and the police actually had
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
her real aunt say to them that very day
 
04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
I don't want her
 
04:26:47.910 --> 04:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
um and because it just like it was
 
04:26:50.830 --> 04:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
pre-ordained It was supposed to happen
 
04:26:54.070 --> 04:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
this child is now under their care it
 
04:26:55.469 --> 04:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
was established
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
immediately because of the fictive kin a
 
04:26:59.199 --> 04:27:00.910 align:start position:0%
immediately because of the fictive kin a
a

04:27:00.910 --> 04:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
permission I'm not sure what word to use
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
but because it is
 
04:27:08.590 --> 04:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
allowed she this child could once again
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
go into a home and be cared for while
 
04:27:14.990 --> 04:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
they were doing all the steps necessary
 
04:27:18.429 --> 04:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
because if they had waited for the um
 
04:27:21.070 --> 04:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
for them to complete the foster care
 
04:27:23.550 --> 04:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
that would have taken a few months
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
meanwhile this child needed shelter
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
immediately and so the story that's how
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
I found out about it because I was
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
called would you be a reference you know
 
04:27:38.910 --> 04:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
a personal reference for the the uh new
 
04:27:38.920 --> 04:27:40.149 align:start position:0%
a personal reference for the the uh new
fictive

04:27:40.149 --> 04:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
fictive
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
parents so I thought but I had to say
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
this because as representative Nelson
 
04:27:46.080 --> 04:27:47.149 align:start position:0%
this because as representative Nelson
pointed

04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
pointed
 
04:27:49.710 --> 04:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
out you don't want to send a child
 
04:27:51.269 --> 04:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
anywhere where they're not going to be
 
04:27:53.950 --> 04:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
cared for safely but you can't just
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
assume that because they are relatives
 
04:27:58.590 --> 04:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
that it's any safer than someone that
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
you're vetting and have a relationship
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
with so I certainly support continuing
 
04:28:08.910 --> 04:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
continuing the fictive relationship
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
qualifying people to be uh caretaker
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
Akers of children who need a safe home
 
04:28:18.429 --> 04:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
