good morning and welcome to the Commerce
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
Committee good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members thank you
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
for considering your this test this
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
legislation today my name is Alison NAB
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
I am the state rep for Rockingham 12
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
which is strum New Hampshire over in the
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast um this bill is is being
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
introduced out of concerns of
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
constituents in stratum um I have
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
several constituents that form a condo
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
association in town that represent
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
several Condominiums condominium areas
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
and they had two concerns with the RS
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
around meeting noticing as written um
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
the first is the requirement for Condo
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
Association meetings which is currently
 
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
10 days there was concerned about that
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
being too long of a noticing period um
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
for condo associations to be able to
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
make decisions so the legislation as
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
written would amend that to a 5-day
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
notice period for condos where 70% or
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
more of the residents are full-time
 
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
residents of the of the
 
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
condos um they had originally proposed
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
24 hours which I think is probably a
 
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
little short for condo associations so
 
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
the five-day noticing period for
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
associations where most of the residents
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
are full-time um seems appropriate their
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
other concern was the language in the
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
RSA as it stands uh is a little gray
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
oh it's a little gray as to whether um
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
Committees of the association also are
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
subject to the same noticing
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
requirements and I know there's some
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
debate as to whether that's unclear or
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
not they feel that it is and these are
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
people that want to be following the RSA
 
00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
to the letter of the law so the change
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
to the legislation would allow for
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
Committees of the association to not be
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
subject to the same noticing
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
requirements so long as they're not
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
taking action signing contracts this
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
would allow them to do things such as
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
meeting with
 
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
landscapers um other contractors and I
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
think this is a good adjustment to
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that if you're trying to
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
make appointments with landscapers and
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
the like you don't have to say I can't
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
do it for 10 days from now so it would
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
allow them to to meet with contractors
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
and have flexibility around that um so
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
that those are the proposed changes and
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
I am happy to answer any questions you
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
have and I thank you for your
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
consideration okay any questions from
 
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.150 align:start position:0%
consideration okay any questions from
committee

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
members just getting arms so so you're
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
trying to shorten notification
 
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
days and and your per reason for
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
shortening the notification days is 10
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
days is too much it allows greater
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility for condo associations where
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
um most of the residents are full-time
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
residents so that's who this would apply
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
to if 70% or more full-time residents it
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
gives them more flexibility and in
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
stratum it's not a tourist town this is
 
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
the case most of our condos that's where
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
they live those are their homes so um I
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
have a constituent who is going to speak
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
to this a little bit further the
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
motivation behind it but that is the the
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
purpose is to make the notification
 
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.030 align:start position:0%
purpose is to make the notification
shorter

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
shorter
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough I guess we have no more
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions for you thank you very much
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay so uh Dean who
 
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.750 align:start position:0%
okay so uh Dean who
[Music]

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
Dean uh lenon in support of the bill
 
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
another Gary yes good morning everyone
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
my name is I am an attorney in New
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire masss focus on
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.790 align:start position:0%
Hampshire masss focus on
law

00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
ins we support this bill uh because for
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
the reason stated by the
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor um I do think there are good
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
reasons to have meetings where um
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
minutes are not required where things
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
are a little less formal not every condo
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
is run like 500 company and this bill
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
reflects that I days
 
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.550 align:start position:0%
reflects that I days
in

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.550 align:start position:0%
in
mostes

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%

AR

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
speaking okay any anybody have any
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
questions oh okay we do have a question
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
spear

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
having lived in a condo once a long time
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
ago my recollection is 5 days was a
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
problem only because so many people were
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
on vacation at various times do you see
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
mean

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
well let me just pick up on that um this
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
is condo day and we're going to hear a
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
lot of different condo issues so in
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
terms of what you was just saying the
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
five days if um if there was an issue
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
that was uh a certain member in the
 
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
condo who had strong opinions about it
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
and if we move it to five days and they
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
just happen to be on vacation and the
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
board decides oh great this is our
 
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:16.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take this issue up while
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
that person's out of
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
town wouldn't that be a
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
be

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
please if the
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
board was engaged in Shenanigans like
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
that and they knew Mr Smith was going
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
away in two weeks they could just
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
schedule the meeting for then so five or
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
10 if the board is engaged in these
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
sorts of shenanigans I'm not sure any
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
legislation will stop them but the point
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
my from my perspective most boards are
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
not involved in anything like that and
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
they schedule ual meetings when their
 
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
members can make it and for no other uh
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
nefarious reasons so that that concern
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative hunt would would not uh
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
bother me
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
personally okay represent
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
taking our questions the 70%
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
threshold um could you just explain
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
where that number comes from and what
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
happens if you're below that threshold
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
well it's not my bill so I don't know
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
where that number was to derive from um
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
so I'd prefer the sponsor to resp
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
respond to that I think the idea was to
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh for communities where most people are
 
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
are investor owners or it's a ski or
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
lake house that it wouldn't apply but
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
where the 70% came from I can't
 
00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:43.590 align:start position:0%
where the 70% came from I can't
say

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
followup is that the right number if in
 
00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:47.150 align:start position:0%
followup is that the right number if in
your

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
opinion it it certainly strikes a
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
balance I think 50% would be too low so
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
I think something in the range of a
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
super majority uh does seem
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.110 align:start position:0%
super majority uh does seem
appropriate

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you thank you uh now
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%

of the unit owners are full-time

board flexibility in scheduling meetings
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
and more complete agendas uh the notice

the five-day meeting notice is an
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable standard compared to RSA 9A
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
which applies to meeting notices of
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
public bodies RSA 9A applies to public
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
bodies such as Town select boards School
 
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.120 align:start position:0%

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
funds have fewer meeting requirements
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
than condominium boards the RSA 91 A2
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
requires a 24hour notice prior to a
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
meeting and No
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
Agenda uh the section seven is purposes
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
to really clarify paragraph one that
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
implies that all Association committees
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
are required to follow the meeting
 
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
requirements of RSA b37 C uh we're
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
exempt Association committees from rsab
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
b37 c meeting requirements if the
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
association bylaws do not authorize the

committee to spend funds or enter into
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
contracts Association residents
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
volunteer to serve on committees if
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
committees were required to meet the
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
requirements of RSA b37 C participation
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
reduced uh the condominium Leadership
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
Council and the vineyard Boards of
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
directors support the enactment of
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
HB uh 1112 thank you for hearing my
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the question of
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
vacations uh at our condominium we have
 
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
four quarterly meetings the quarterly
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
meetings are posted a year in advance
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
they are in the middle month of the
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
quarter every resident knows when a
 
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
board meeting will take place and can
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
either schedule their vacation around
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
that time or not attend at the board
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
meetings we do open with an open form
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
for board for Resident members that is
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
where they speak the rest of the meeting
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
is closed for the board of directors to
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
discuss a subject
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
residents would have to be recognized by
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
the chairman and the resident would have
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
to be on a committee that would be
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
pertinent in Germain to the discussion
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
at hand uh why five days the reason for
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
five days is because we uh one of our
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
members looked looked at RSA 91a and
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
basically said Gee if these other board
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
members that are P other boards that are
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
public only give 24 hours notice why do
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
we have to give 10 so we settled on five
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that is concludes my testimony thank
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%

left good morning and welcome back thank
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
you uh good morning as well uh my name
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
is Gary didario I'm one of the partners
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
at Marcus Rico Emer and Brooks um like
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
Dean lenon that you heard from a few
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
minutes ago I'm an attorney who
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
practices condominium law here in New
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um that is my focus all my
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
clients are condominium associations I'm
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of the community
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
associations Institute they have a New
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislative action committee
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
and uh I presently chair that committee
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I will be brief we support this bill
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
um as a committee um in general we see
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
no adverse effects coming from this bill
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
we don't uh based on the changes that uh
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
are being proposed we don't see any
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
problems coming out of it and uh frankly
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to um Roman numeral 1 it
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
seems like it would be very helpful for
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
boards to have an outlet even if it's
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
just to do things like compare proposals
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
that they've received for contracts to
 
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
have an outlet where they can meet and
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
try to be productive and actually get
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
some of the administrative work done um
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
separate and apart from all of those
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
sessions that they're already required
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
by Statute to have um open with the
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
community to take ious you know issues
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the community uh Roman numeral one
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
here would give the board a chance to
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
work on some administrative items and to
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
study the paperwork that they need to
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
study at times when they need to do
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
something like consider uh their vendor
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
or the terms of a specific contract uh
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
as has been mentioned previously um this
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
bill does not allow them to make a
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
decision on that contract or to take a
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
vote on it during that private session
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
um and so I still think that the balance
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
is struck in that this bill protects the
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
community because even after the board
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
has met to compare these various
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
proposals and so on there would still be
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
a vote taken uh relative to that vendor
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
or that contract at the next open
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
meeting um so again we we feel like the
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
bill might have some positive impacts we
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
impacts great thank you very much thank
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
you having no more cards on
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
12

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:26.669 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:26:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
you pray sponsor good morning uh good
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
morning chair hunt and my esteemed
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the Commerce Committee
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to be here on this snowy
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
morning thanks for making the Trek to be
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
here I appreciate you uh my name is
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative Rebecca McWilliams I
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
represent South conquer um and I'm here
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
today to talk to you about uh how we
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
decide uh if we're on a condo board what
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
kind of energy and what kind of
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
utilities we are going to be spending
 
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
the boards and the everyone on who owns
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
a condo uh everyone's money on what
 
00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:00.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to do with energy and
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
utilities um so as just as background as
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
you may know um we have had some pretty
 
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
severe price spikes in energy both
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
natural gas and electricity and I know I
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
have I assume you have as well heard
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
from constituents that the cost of
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
energy is just exorbitantly high in New
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what can we do as
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
representatives to address this and try
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
to mitigate the cost spikes uh and so
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is really an approach to
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
address how do we pivot how do we and
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
particularly condo owners how do we
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
pivot and how do we decide okay it's
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
probably not working whatever energy
 
00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
source we've selected to use for our
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
condo how can we change that um as a
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
collective group um so the intent here
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
is really to get rid of what I see as an
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
impediment and a concern um if you have
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
bylaws for your condo that say you need
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
a two-thirds majority decision to make a
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
change and that's pretty common although
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's not the only obviously written uh
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
requirement sometimes it's uh simple
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
majority 50% plus one um in very rare
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
instances it's actually three qus which
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
is really hard to change your bylaws um
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
but all of this is to say okay you have
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
a potential change coming down the
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
pipeline and you've decided you want to
 
00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:16.519 align:start position:0%
switch your energy source this is energy
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
agnostic you want to change to Natural
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
Gas you want to change to Electric you
 
00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:23.519 align:start position:0%
want to put in solar you want to change
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
to propane it doesn't really matter what
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
kind of energy you as a condo owner want
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
to switch to the important thing here is
 
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
we're trying to stay ahead of the market
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
and allow uh the condo boards to Pivot
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
and to change your energy source without
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
having what I see as a large impediment
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
to being able to make that change now
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
I've talked to some folks who um are
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
very involved with this issue and
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a concern about when
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
you have um a large Collective of units
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
and many of these units are actually
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
owned by either one person or
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
potentially by the um the initial
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
developer of the
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
development often times the two-thirds
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
majority is required to make sure that
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
the developer of the development or a
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
single owner who owns many many units is
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
not playing King and making decisions
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the condo unit owners
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
and so two-thirds was really meant to be
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
a protection for everybody to create a
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
larger um hurdle to make sure that that
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
this is not being forced upon people but
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
considering what we've been seeing from
 
00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:28.039 align:start position:0%
constituents and concerns about energy
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
prices I would posit that this is
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
probably not the sort of situation where
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
we want to force a two-thirds majority I
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
think that in this case it makes sense
 
00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:39.559 align:start position:0%
to make it a simple majority 50% plus
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
one in order for everyone to have an
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
informed discussion and to vote about
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
how they're going to move forward and
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
change energy or utilities um and so
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of this bill is to
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that if and when a condo board
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
and everyone who owns the condos decides
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
they want to change energy and utility
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
is they can do it with a simple majority
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay um I guess I'll start
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
right in
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
um this statute the 23s obviously is
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
been controversial over the
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
years and um and even since we enacted
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
it when there was a condo re re
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
reenactment and this got stuck in there
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
and and uh and I feel like we've had
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
this issue almost annually about the
 
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote so I guess I'm a little
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
of concern is that we're chipping away
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
at this this and say okay but there's
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
one thing we're going to say it's okay
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
that the two-thirds won't happen and
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
that would be setting a precedent now
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
for people to then say but we got this
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
issue and we got that issue we got these
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
issues and that issues and before you
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
know it we've undermined the whole
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
purpose of this two3 you know the super
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
majority to uh have the
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
the any of these votes taken so I
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
guess uh do you do you understand that
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
the the committee should be show be
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
extremely concerned to just pick one
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
issue like this issue today and I don't
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
even know whether this has actually been
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
a problem in the past but to pick this
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
one issue now is setting a precedent
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
that we'll then have um uh every year
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
we'll have people come in and say well
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
we want to add another item to this
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
exemption thank you so much for the
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
question chair hunt um let me just start
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
by saying uh I understand that this
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
could be precedent setting I get it um
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
also I think we're in a bit of an
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
emergency situation uh where people's
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
hands are tied and they are ready to
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
change their energy source but they
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
can't scramble together the correct
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
2third amount of votes to get there so
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
they're really tied their next step is
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
they need to sell their condo and find
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere else to live because energy
 
00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
has become too expensive in what they're
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
locked in because they don't have the
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
votes to change the energy source with
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
their condo board so we're forcing
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
people to leave their housing rather
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
than changing their energy source I
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of a big deal um I
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
understand the president's setting and
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
the concern that this is a slippery
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
slope um I would I would say that that's
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
our job as legislators uh to determine
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
where do we draw the line and are there
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
carve outs that are necessary and I
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
would say in this case considering the
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
emergency that we're dealing with I do
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
think that this is worthwhile for
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
carving out you may disagree and that's
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
fine um but I I think that sometimes
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
something arises to the level of public
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
concern to the point where we as
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
legislators need to act and I certainly
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
understand that this may open the door
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
to having more people file more bills
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
next year if the governor were to sign
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
this into law because of the concerns
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
about well if they could do it for
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
energy then can we do it for XYZ can we
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
do it for other things and that's part
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
of being legislators is making that
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
decision as a committee and as a body
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
what else is the appropriate thing to do
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
for the people of New Hampshire so thank
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
question representa Ammon has a question
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for coming
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
and testifying and introducing the bill
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh just just reading the language around
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
the proposed change I have that in front
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
of me uh it starts out if more than 50%
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
of the votes are acquired by a single
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
person after developer control is
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
terminated then a super majority 2third
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
is required uh if we carve out uh what
 
00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:43.230 align:start position:0%
is required uh if we carve out uh what
you're

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
proposing wouldn't that allow
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
potentially a single person to change
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
the bylaws and the budgets and the
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
contracted Property Management because
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
the beginning of that sentence as of
 
00:33:57.629 --> 00:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
more than
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
50% of the votes are acquired by a
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
single person so that would be a simple
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
majority potentially by one person is is
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
do you see that as a potential
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
problem um thank you representative
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
Ammon that's an excellent
 
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
point um a lot of this has to do with
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
the number of units that we're talking
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
about right it's different if there are
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
100 units than if there are 10 um but
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
nonetheless if we say 50% of the votes
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
it could be five it could be 50 are
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
still belonging to a single person um
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
then we still have the 2third majority
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
required to change bylaws but with this
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
carve out we have 50% plus one so you
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
have that one person let's say it's a 10
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
unit just to keep it simple one person
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
owns five units so they would need to
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
convince one other unit to get six units
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
to vote for the 50% plus one majority
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
got it so the math here is
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
still you need potentially one person if
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
they have five plus a friend number six
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
unit or um if it's 100 units then they
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
have 50 they would still need to come up
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
with that additional vote so one person
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
plus one um the two-thirds majority is
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
really intended to protect everyone else
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
but when we're talking about energy I
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
think we're having some robust
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
discussions here on condo boards and and
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong here but I I
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
have heard from constituents that this
 
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:26.599 align:start position:0%
is a concern that they are locked in to
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
some something very expensive for their
 
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
heating this past winter they'd like to
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
change and they can't get the votes so I
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
guess the question is would you see a
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment um that could
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
protect that one person having five or
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
50 units and allow more input from
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
others without going to the two-thirds
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
is there a way to come up with better
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
language for question just to clarify
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
this does this this paragraph only kicks
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
in if someone has more than 50% so they
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
would have to have six out of 10 or 51
 
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
out of 100 and so that single person
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
would have a majority vote and be able
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
to change these important documents
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
so yes I think an amendment uh is a
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
potential remedy thank
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
you would you believe thank you I would
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
believe that um and I would be open to
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
an amendment that addresses that because
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
I think that's a concern um I also think
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
that locking in it at 2/3 is too high so
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
txon hi there um so as it happens in in
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
my world I deal with condo associations
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
but on the western side of the state so
 
00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:44.599 align:start position:0%
uh I'm you've described this as a a
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
crisis people are being forced out of
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
their homes and I am not
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
aware in my on the western side of the
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
state where how are you what percentage
 
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.109 align:start position:0%
state where how are you what percentage
of

00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
Condominiums are operated or structured
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
in such a way that uh what you choose to
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
heat who you choose to heat your house
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
with affects who I choose choose to heat
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
my house with I'm not familiar with that
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
are we talking propane or something or
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
El what what is this heating source that
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'm forced into because the condos that
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with in chesher county and
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County primarily are heated
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
independently of each
 
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
other um thank you for the question
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
generally this happens when it's a very
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
large building with individual units
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
that are all attached or connected as
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to Standalone units and the
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
largest culprit during this past winter
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
was natural gas so we're talking about
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
individual buildings or connected
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
buildings that are all in the same heat
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
system as as a percentage of homeowners
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
associ or condo associations in in New
 
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.230 align:start position:0%
associ or condo associations in in New
Hampshire

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
do you think it's 50% or structured that
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
way or 5% or do we have any idea or
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're just taking a guess I would be
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
happy to do some research on that to get
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
you an answer but I can't speak and say
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
it's X percentage
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay I I I have to admit I agree with
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
you I thought every condo had its own
 
00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
meter but evidently you're saying
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
there's some that don't have separate
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
meter I mean is this common room space
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
you're worried about or is it the actual
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
the all the units really only have one
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
boiler in the whole building it's not a
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
question of number of boilers and it's
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
not a question of individual meters this
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
is the energy source is it natural gas
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
is it propane is it solar is it electric
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
where are we getting our energy from for
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
the condo and so big picture it's we are
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
locked into this rate because we chose
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
this type of energy it's not I spend
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
more money on mine you spend less money
 
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
on yours I set my thermostat at 65 you
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
set your thermostat at 60 that's not the
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
issue the issue is overall we are locked
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
into a specific energy source because
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
the condo board has decided this is the
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
energy that we're going to have for our
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
entire condo unit okay so we do have
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
another bill that uh we're going to be
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
talking about the propane
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
contracts and people feeling locked into
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
those propane contracts which sounds
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
like that's more the issue here than
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
this particular issue because in
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
generally most condo units do have their
 
00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
own electrical utility in which you can
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
then negotiate I guess the wholesale who
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
you're getting your wholesale from but I
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
agree with you chair um but I want to be
 
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
clear that if you have electric
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
baseboard heat you're going to be
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
spending a lot more on your electricity
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
than if you have some other form of
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
boiler whether it's oil natural gas or
 
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
propane because electric baseboard heat
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
is the most inefficient type of heat we
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
have you could switch to something like
 
00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.589 align:start position:0%
have you could switch to something like
a

00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
um heat pump right a heat pump would be
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
way more efficient correct but big
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
picture we're talking about something
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's been selected and chosen
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
typically at the time that the condo was
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
built so some of these are from the 70s
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
and the 80s and if they're going to
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
upgrade they upgrade everyone at once so
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about being locked into a
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
specific type of energy and propane is
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
certainly a concern I've heard the
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
propane concerns but this the intent of
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is to talk about energy as a
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
broad swath and make sure that if the
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
OWN owners want to switch to a different
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
type of energy they can and they're not
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
expensive thanks for taking my question
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
and you had said that there could be an
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
emergency um in terms of the heating
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
costs and is there a dramatic difference
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
between you mentioned the the the
 
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
electric heating boards is there dramat
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
really a dramatic difference between
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
that and some of the other sources that
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
move well
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
I think this is all anecdotal right I
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't have the data to tell you it's
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
going to be three times more expensive
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
to use baseboard heat than to use
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
natural gas I can't tell you that
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
specifically I can say that we certainly
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
have people who purchase a condo and
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
think that it's a great investment and
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
they're happy living there until they
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
get the crazy electric bills when we
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
have a winter where all of our energy
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
costs are way out of whack you know
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
based on International conflicts and
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
also local supply issues so when that
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
happens people say what do I need to do
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
to get my budget on track I probably
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
need to figure out my energy costs
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
because that's the bill that's coming
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
every month and it's way more than I
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
budgeted for right so if you're using
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
electric baseboard heat just as an
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
example that is going to be something
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
that you can say oh maybe I can switch
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
to an oil furnace and I can spend less
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
money on that right that would make
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
sense because I know that it's an
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
investment and I will probably save
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
money down the line based on historical
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
returns and so I'm not going to play the
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
role of financial advisor here I'm just
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
going to say when someone looks at their
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
own budget and cost and they say wow I'm
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
spending way too much on electricity
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
this year I got to do something to
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
reduce that these are the discussions
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're hearing folks have at their condo
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
board meeting where they say hey
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
everybody in this condo is using
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
electric baseboard heat it's become
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
phenomenally expensive can we switch to
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
something else so no this doesn't impact
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
the whole state and certainly if you are
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
in a detached condo unit that has its
 
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
own Electric Supply and you are able to
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
choose the supplier and you're able to
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
choose whether you're doing electric
 
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
baseboard heat or some other say heat
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
pump for your own unit and it's not
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
controlled by the condo board then you
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
are not subject to this discussion you
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
are outside of this bill because you can
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
choose your own energy source for how
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to heat your house your
 
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:47.559 align:start position:0%
your condo in the winter this is
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
specific to when everyone is locked in
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
we're all using electric baseboard we're
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
all paying the unfortunately probably
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
default service rate for that electric
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
and it's become exorbitant so the goal
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
here is to allow the switch without
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
creating another
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
hurdle okay have more questions
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
represent Spears next and then we have
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative Su and then we have
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
and I could tell you you don't switch
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
from electric baseboard to a heat pump
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
system that the condo has to vote for
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
that change the whole condo will have to
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
vote to to change the the physical
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
structure of the building so to
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
represent 's point where he said he has
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
condos in his district where people
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
control their own energy and they can
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
choose which one they're at that would
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
be an example where one unit could go to
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
a a heat pump if that's true and I don't
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
know if that's true but I'm using this
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
as an example right I'm just saying
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
using an example which I don't think it
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
makes any sense to me because I cannot
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
imagine that there is a single
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
condo condos in this state that is using
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
electric base board and has only one
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
meter I would guarantee you that any
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
condo if there are condos out there that
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
are using electric baseboard which there
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
could be I guarantee you they have their
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
own meter for that condo I I want to
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
explain that this is not about number of
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
meters every single unit has its own
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
meter that's intentional every single
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
unit pays for their own usage that's
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
intentional what I'm talking about is a
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
tripling sometimes quadrupling of the
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
base rate like we all did yes correct
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
everybody it's it's not about individual
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
meters and I'm not trying to posit that
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
there's one meter for 10 units or 100
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
units that's not what I'm saying what
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is everyone is committed to a
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
specific type of heat in in a
 
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
self-contained condo unit building that
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
everyone is all connected they're all in
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
one building okay they're all using the
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
same type of heat but they all have
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
their own meters so they can decide what
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
they set their thermostats at and they
 
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:52.559 align:start position:0%
can decide how much they're going to
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
spend because they can adjust their
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
consumption right that's that's the
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
standard base but when the prices get so
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
expensive that people are looking for an
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
alternative to switch to some other type
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
of energy as a collective all 100 units
 
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
in the self-contained building all on
 
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
their own meters they're ready to switch
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
to some other type of energy it takes
 
00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:14.559 align:start position:0%
2third to say all right we're ready to
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
go to whatever the source is okay you're
 
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
using that example if I have my elect
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
everyone of them's got the separate
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
electric bill and they want to change
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
their wholesale supplier they would not
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
need a vote they could simply notify the
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
utility company they want to change
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
their wholesale supplier and that's what
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're what we we are aware as and being
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
on this committee is if you were to do a
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
wholeale change I.E change the actual
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
heating system yes to each unit yes that
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely requires a capital
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
structural change to the condos yes and
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely that is really radical if you
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
want to create an exemption for that
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
because we have bills that say simple
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
things like uh what was the one we had
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh somebody wanted to put an antenna for
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
his uh
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
um what what said uh CB radio no it
 
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the other short we
 
00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
radio we had a building in here that
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
somebody just want to hang wires for a
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
short weight radio okay and the condo
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
associations say you know that that
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
think has to be approved by the condos
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
everybody has to agree so if if if
 
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.790 align:start position:0%
everybody has to agree so if if if
everyone

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
agrees that they want to get rid of this
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
electric baseboard and they want to put
 
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
in a heat pump system yes you don't
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
won't need just this little you know I
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
mean to have this exemption would be
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
pretty radical that's what it is okay so
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
that that the assumption would be is
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees that they would want
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
that change now if some people want it
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
and some people don't now you're
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
radically changing the look of the condo
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
and that is at the heart of condos which
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
is that has to be a uniform decision by
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
all the condo members if they want to
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
change and put heat pumps on the outside
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
of all the of of some of them and not
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
all of them just saying I understand
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
what you're saying I think we're getting
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
closer to understanding each other's
 
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
intent here with this bill I I think
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
we're getting very close good so the
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
point of this bill is that it's energy
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
agnostic okay it's not just about
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
switching from baseboards to heat pumps
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
it's also about whether you want to go
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
from baseboard to natural gas all right
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
so you're going to add whole that's that
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
a baseboard could have gas it could have
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
oil okay so what you want to say is how
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
about I just want to change who my
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
natural gas provider was okay that would
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
be related to the tank okay if each
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
condo had its own tank they easily would
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
be allowed to change out their tanks
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
without a mo vote from the rest of the
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
so I think baseboard might be a red
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
herring in this discussion I was just
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
saying electric baseboard is the most
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
expensive okay that that is I don't
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
recommend it for anyone as an architect
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
who does construction and projects like
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
this I would never recommend an electric
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
baseboard because it's so expensive heat
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
pump is an alternative if you wanted to
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
go that route but obviously there are
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
aesthetic concerns I agree with you do
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
you want some bulbous things sticking
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
off the back of your building probably
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
not and you need to figure out where to
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
put the condenser units it's a whole
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
change but if we're talking about
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
furnaces okay if we're talking about you
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
want to use gas versus na uh let's say
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
oil versus natural gas furnace right and
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
right now you're on electric baseboard
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
heat you would still need to find
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere to put your new oil or natural
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
gas furnace right and then you're
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
switching for every unit because they're
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
individually metered you would be
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
switching that is a big
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
change agree 100% so we have
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
constituents who have sticker shock
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
right now who are talking about oh my
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
God how do I get away from this I can't
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
keep spending this much money on heating
 
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
okay and they're looking at these big
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
changes and saying all right I want to
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
stay in this condo I want to keep
 
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
heating but I can't keep heating the way
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
I'm heating okay that is the intent of
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is to enable that switch and
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
not make it a 2/3 hurdle in order to do
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
a big change but obviously yes I agree
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
with you there are aesthetic concerns
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is stuff that condo boards
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
look at all the time to make the
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
decision what is appropriate for our
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
units I would say you could probably do
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
a ducted rather than ductless minisplit
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
system so you don't have the bulbous
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
piece on the outside if you're looking
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
at Alternatives okay I'm not going to
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
say that this is black and white but
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
there are many many options out there
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to say that this is
 
00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
about a specific type of energy because
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's not it's about allowing people to
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
make the choice and make the decision
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
ision to change thank you got it
 
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.549 align:start position:0%
ision to change thank you got it
represent

00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
spear a a number of the changes that
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about for instance if I as
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
a unit and it could be in in an attached
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
condo kind of
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
thing wanted to put in
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
solar or if the whole condo wanted to
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
put in
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
solar that's a capital expenditure and
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
to have it be decided by such a small
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
number of people because the ticker
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
sticker shock from the
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
electricity may not be any more than the
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
sticker shock from the capital
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
investment they're going to have to make
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
so I I I'm not clear on why we wouldn't
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
want to have as much buy into to this as
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
possible so that the 49% of people who
 
00:50:46.349 --> 00:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
never voted on it don't end up suing all
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
place anyway that's I would like to know
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
why would you
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
believe thank you for the question okay
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I I don't
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
really know what you're looking for in
 
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
response from me on that um I think that
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
this comes down to people making
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
long-term decisions about their energy
 
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.430 align:start position:0%
long-term decisions about their energy
because

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very expensive thing to budget
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
for and it's difficult to budget for
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
when things change so dramatically year
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
over year uh so obviously this is a
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
discussion that would happen at the
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
condo board level and everyone would
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
heard great thank you um
 
00:51:28.589 --> 00:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
okay yeah did you fill out a card I'm
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
not sure I yes I did gave you a we
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
have you you still want to ask a
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
question okay um my understanding is the
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's electricity and gas are the two
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
forms that went up dramatically in terms
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
of pricing if would it be would it be
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to have a
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
trigger in for example U the where I
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
live it's
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
gas and and you know it's gone up and
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
not not something I can't handle it but
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of people know that the bill
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
is a lot larger and is if you have a
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
situation where you have a larger
 
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.510 align:start position:0%
situation where you have a larger
Condominium

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
Condominium
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
Association three or four buildings you
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
know a couple hundred of this or that
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
and but they're all on the same supplier
 
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
in our case
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
gas could you have a trigger point would
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
a uh a
 
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh would it be worthwhile to have a a
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
percentage increase that would trigger
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
the ability of the association to select
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
question um I think that's a really
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
novel question uh if you're if you're
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
trying to quantify that that trigger in
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
terms of price increase and over a
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
certain duration of time like
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
understanding our market right now uh we
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
are typically seeing two changes in
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
prices there's one in the spring and one
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
in the fall okay and hopefully the one
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
in the spring is the decrease and the
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
one in the fall tends to be the really
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
big increase at least
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
historically um so trying to set a
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
Baseline and saying okay um if
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
the cost per kilowatt hour were to
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
increase by 200% or more that is a
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
trigger for this 51% change potentially
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
2third I could see that being a
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
potential amendment to this bill to
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
create some sort of mechanism to say
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
it's become an emergency situation we
 
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
are suddenly in a situation where people
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
are not able to budget for um the crazy
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
increase in cost and so they're all
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
feeling the hurt um I I think that that
 
00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's a novel question and it's
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
probably worth discussing a little
 
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
further if there's a way to come up with
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
metrics I'm just talking off the cuff
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
because you posited it right now um but
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
I do think that there may be some way to
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
come up with um some protection around
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
that I understand the chair is very
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about a slippery slope and
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
opening the door to more and more people
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get a reduced vote uh
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
threshold um but I think we we as
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
legislators are legislators we as people
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
who are elected to serve our
 
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
constituents need to be sensitive to the
 
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
needs of our constituents specifically
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
when we're all hearing the same thing
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
about cost and uh Energy prices so there
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
may be a way to come up with that um I'm
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
I'm open to further discussion on that
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
okay you have one more question
 
00:54:34.839 --> 00:54:36.349 align:start position:0%
okay you have one more question
representative

00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you so kind of to go back
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
to the the wording of this and I don't
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
know if you will be the answer or maybe
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
the chair might know best but um I'm
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the the
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
50% that seems this seems to only be
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
relevant when more than 50% of the
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
people or of the vot vot are acquired by
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
a single person so is this like a real
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
problem or the majority of condos or
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
even a sizable minority of condo
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
associations owned by uh have 50% owned
 
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
by um one individual because if that's
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
not the case it sounds like this is not
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
relevant unless I'm wrong is it
 
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
two-thirds all the time or only under
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
question well the um
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
and what did happen yes it was 2/3 the
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
super majority was put in um and that
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
was because of attendance for a meeting
 
00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
and that that if you're see 50% is
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
implying you know the terms of the 50%
 
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
plus one and what if everybody attended
 
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
but was more important that was if the
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
if the vote went down not again again
 
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
the most classic example is the budget
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
itself if the the budget was voted down
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
um the concern was then
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh now you have put every condo in a
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
position where they are going to have a
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
litigation they're going to have a
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
difficulty def finding the resolution so
 
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:10.839 align:start position:0%
that's why the super majority was put in
 
00:56:13.029 --> 00:56:13.039 align:start position:0%
the two-thirds was put in uh it's been
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
controversial over the years because
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
everyone says that's outrageous that you
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
have to have a super majority to
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
overturn the budget and that's that's
 
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
usually what we've seen in bills in the
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
past but it was it was uh a policy
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
decision uh it was worked out negotiated
 
00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time and the condo
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
owners agreed and condo agreed that that
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
was the right answer so yeah so but my
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
question is it's the way I read this if
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
more than 50% of the votes are acquired
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
by a single
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
person that's when the two-thirds
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
majority kicks in that single person is
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
a little misle that's just that's that's
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
just 50 you know the count what happens
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
in 50% is
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
50.5 so that single person language
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
there is meant to imply with the numbers
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
we were discussing that if you had 10
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
condos that means six would would be
 
00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
what you need so that's that was the the
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
plus one single person is just an is
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
just a to handle fractions okay but like
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
if if is this relevant I guess let's go
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
to a 10 unit thing is 2/3 required if
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
all 10 units are owned by 10 different
 
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
people sounds like 2/3 is not required
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
in that situation right so so if all 10
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
people have 10 separate units right okay
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
then it's just a 50% plus one no ex
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
provided that so in other words that um
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh the majority vote would would be
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
required um the that that paragraph
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me that's the language of the
 
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
bill um that it was intended that um 2/3
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
was for anything that you were changing
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
budgets bylaws yeah that's not how I
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
read it that's why I'm a little confused
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh like well okay we can hash it out
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
another time it just seems like it only
 
00:58:06.029 --> 00:58:06.039 align:start position:0%
when there's a a majority ownership by
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
somebody there majority the majority the
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
Assumption was the majority was written
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
in most by laws and then we rais it to
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
2/3 but I agree you the way it's written
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
it seems a little awkward but basically
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
yes 2/3 is pretty much everything that
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
the so a majority vote um is uh the
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
majority vote is everything uh but
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
bylaws budgets and
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
contracts is majority vote but if it's
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
bylaws budgets or contracts with
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
property management then it has to be a
 
00:58:38.839 --> 00:58:42.029 align:start position:0%
property management then it has to be a
two-thirds

00:58:42.029 --> 00:58:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
vote okay representative
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chairman um my
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
question is basically to to clarify
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
because I I got a little bit confused by
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
what was just just said um so I'm going
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
to try and clarify with a concrete
 
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
example which happens to be my own I
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
live in a condo development with 200
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
units okay more than half of those units
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
are owned by one entity I'm not sure
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's a corporation or an
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
individual human but I don't think it
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
would matter so under those
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances to change the bylaws we
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
would need a 2third vote but the
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
question then is if all of those 200
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
units were owned individually that is
 
00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839 align:start position:0%
there was no majority
 
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
owner could the bylaws be changed if we
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
chose to do it that way uh under statute
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
could the bylaws be changed by a
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
you I I guess I'll have to ask the
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers but they'll come up and they'll
 
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
clarify this for for you just okay thank
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you for your time
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
card yeah okay good morning again Dean
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
Lennon for the community association's
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh Institute um I think we started off
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
today being neutral on this I think I'm
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
I'm far more um against at this point um
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
to answer representative Gibb's question
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to come down to the condo's
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
governing documents um sometimes it's a
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
majority to amend bylaws sometimes it's
 
01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
2third uh you know this this uh existing
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh Bill
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
uh requires the two-thirds
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
if half the units are owned by a single
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
person and and to address representative
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
Sullivan that's exceedingly rare in my
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh experience it's exed except it occurs
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
in hers yes yeah okay so why don't you
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
answer her question what exactly if they
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
were to change in her condos given that
 
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
one half 100 of them are owned by the
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
developer probably she would need the
 
01:01:12.559 --> 01:01:14.069 align:start position:0%
developer probably she would need the
two-thirds

01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
vote but what if they were all owned
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
individually then we could decide for
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves whether we wanted 2/3 or
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
simple majorities it depends what you're
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
existing documents say no I understand
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
that but if we chose to have our
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
documents could we under statute make it
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
a simple majority yes thank you
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
yes so I I think if we just assume
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with heating costs and
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
people being priced out we'll just
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
assume that to be true I don't think
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation fixes the issue uh
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
because most of the we don't see this
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
issue first of all because if you're
 
01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
going to go from baseboard heat to forc
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
hot air or something like that it
 
01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter go from A to B B to C it
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter just pick pick your
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh your type of of heat it's such a
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
profound change that it's just never
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
going to happen you're talking about
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
ripping things out of walls you're
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
talking about installing things on the
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
exterior these are things that condos
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
don't do they have what they have and
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
they deal with it and I think the answer
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
is what what representative hunt said
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
and that's to switch your your carrier
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh or your supplier uh maybe uh you get
 
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
a discount from B but not from a so you
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
go with b and that's a board vote you're
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
not amending your documents to switch
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
from one type of uh heating or one
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
utility to another that's not how you
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
would do it in my opinion it would be an
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
improvement an improvement is something
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
new so you have grass you want to
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
install a tennis court that's not
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
something a board can approve because
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
it's something brand new it's not
 
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance or repair ha it's
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
something that wasn't originally
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
contemplated so if you're going from
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
electric baseboard heat to propane heat
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
to me that's an improvement because it's
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't currently exist
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
and usually under your docks anyone
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
docks that's going to be a majority vote
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh but I think if it's not a majority
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
vote if it's a two-thirds vote that's
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate because you're not going to
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
go from A to B without forcing owners to
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
buy a whole bunch of stuff that's
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
incredibly expensive so if they're
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
having trouble affording uh their
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
utility bills they probably don't have
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
the money to buy a bunch of new
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
equipment to switch over to the new
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
source of energy you just
 
01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
can't go go from Electric to propane
 
01:03:41.559 --> 01:03:42.670 align:start position:0%
can't go go from Electric to propane
without

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and that's the other
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
issue here is do we want a simple
 
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.549 align:start position:0%
issue here is do we want a simple
majority

01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
forcing duck work to be installed on the
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
outside of condos or uh heat pumps on
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
the exterior some people don't mind the
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
look some people do so I think if we're
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
if it is a two-thirds Vote for This sort
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
of thing uh it's an appropriate
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
um hurdle to to cross because we're
 
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
talking about something so
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
transformative for a
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
condo and I I think uh you know
 
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
just uh representative Hunt's comments I
 
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
think struck to the core of the issue
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
and from my perspective our committee
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
supports his uh
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
Outlook question from the committee yes
 
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
representative M uh thank you chairman
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question I I
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
just wonder if this whole thing is even
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
necessary why why not just go by the the
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
documents of that particular uh condo
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
unit which may say 2third may say a
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
majority I I just find
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
this unnecessary yes with respect to the
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor I also find it to be
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it's incredible L specific
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and it opens the door to
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
another interest group trying to carve
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
out their piece I I I too find it to be
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh unnecessary and to Sol uh
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's point it's
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
just this is not going to cure a problem
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
because most condos don't have a single
 
01:05:16.109 --> 01:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
not okay thank you for your time thank
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
you do anybody else would like to
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right because you were in the
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.549 --> 01:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
happen hi uh for the record again Gary
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
didario um testifying on behalf of the
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
community association's Institute
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
legislative action committee for New
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I think a lot of the
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
confusion today is that we're talking
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
about the wrong SE of the statute we're
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
talking about section 39 today a
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
potential amendment to section 39 and as
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
was pointed out by representative hunt
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ammon uh if I got your
 
01:06:08.029 --> 01:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
name right I hope uh and uh
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's question uh
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
all go sort of to the heart of the
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
matter from a statutory perspective the
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
section that we've been talking about
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
this morning is the section that is
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
there for those rare situations when
 
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
there's a concentration of power at the
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
association meaning that one individual
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
or one corporation owns more than 50% of
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
the units that's why that section starts
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
out that way um and as long as we're in
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
section 39 that's sort of the situation
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
that we're trapped in because that's
 
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
what section 39 does IT addresses what
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
happens when there's a concentration of
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
power a lot of questions uh have have
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
gone towards the issue of well what
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
happens when that's not the case what
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
happens if we just have a normal quote
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
unquote normal condominium where um you
 
01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
know units are owned by all different
 
01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
people or to the extent that someone
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
owns a couple of units it's not
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
consequential and it doesn't bring us to
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
section 39 uh the answer to that
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
question is that it's section 34 of the
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
existing statute is where amendments in
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
general are discussed and so if you
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
didn't have a concentration of power at
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
your condominium and you were
 
01:07:24.029 --> 01:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
considering amending things you would be
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
at section 34 not at section 39 I think
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's where the the confusion
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
is great now does this section 34 still
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
have this thing about the two-thirds
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
vote for Budget it does it does um and
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
and uh to that I would Echo uh the
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
comments that Dean lennin just gave you
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
and that I think some of you have have
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
touched on as well um which is that for
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
such a massive undertaking um I think
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
the legislature got it right in looking
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
for the super majority of 2/3 because um
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
at an association if
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
51% said we're switching from Electric
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
to oil then the other 49% which is a lot
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
of people get dragged along into an
 
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
expense where you're ripping out the
 
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
electric stuff you're buying oil tanks
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
you're you're installing whatever
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
equipment is going to run off oil um and
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
that's just sticking with this example
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
in general when you're amending your
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
documents it it could be extremely
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
important because you could be talking
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
about any issue that affects your
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
Association but to the extent that
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
you're making that type of fundamental
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
change because when you buy into a
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
condominium you are in the first place
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
agreeing to live as a member of a group
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's appropriate that if a major
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
change is being made that it takes a lot
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
of that group to want to head in that
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
direction that that just makes sense in
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
general good thank you very much Gary
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank thank you okay having no more
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
cards cards we will close the public
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and now we have another another
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.950 align:start position:0%
 
1430

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
1430
 
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
okay so it is some time so represent on
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
us sorry about our delay here but I'm
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
sure you found the previous discussion
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
very helpful and understanding how
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
condos operate I I did your Mr chair um
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
I welcome the discussion my name is Zoe
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
Manos I represent stratum which is down
 
01:09:31.759 --> 01:09:32.510 align:start position:0%
Manos I represent stratum which is down
near

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
near
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
Portsmith and I'm very pleased to be
 
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
here I'm a freshman so this is the first
 
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
bill that I have uh sponsored and
 
01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
introduced and so uh I'm very excited to
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
do this um so this bill would enable
 
01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
non-commercial condos and I want to
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
emphasize that it's non-commercial non-b
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
buus condos to receive res residential
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
electric rates this bill applies to the
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
condo association as the electric
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
consumer um and not to individual
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
homeowners of course are entitled to
 
01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
receive residential electric rats so
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
this would apply to the condo
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
association um itself as a an electric
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
consumer um this bill uh assures equity
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
for condos so that common expenses such
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
as lighting well pumps septic systems
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
and laundry
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
facilities um are for common expenses
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
are treated as residential rather than
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
um at commercial rates which are
 
01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.510 align:start position:0%
um at commercial rates which are
generally

01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
higher um this bill was requested by my
 
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
constituents from stratum there's a
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
condo Leadership Council in stratum um
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
Mr SWAT is here and he will be
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
testifying uh on my bill
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
and uh I see representative
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
burrow thank you for taking my question
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
and congrats on your first fail here
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um my question is is this a
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
common practice to have residential
 
01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
units get that differential um and be
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
charge the the business rate uh right
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
now it's my understanding and it's my my
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
constituent's experience and and my
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
constituent is the there's an
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
association of condo associations in
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
stratum so there are multiple condos and
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
stratum and their experience is that
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
they are completely residential but they
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
are being charge commercial electric
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
rates followup and not residential
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
rates is is that even
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
legal uh apparently it is Mr SWAT will
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
testify more about this but they had uh
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
multiple discussions with the Pu with um
 
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
with the regulatory entities and they
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
were told repeatedly that they are not
 
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
entitled that they must be build at the
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
G2 rate and not at residential rates
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
suin uh thanks for your testimony so

of her because I understood what you
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
said a little bit differently are you
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
saying that the individual private
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
residential unit is being charged
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
commercial or just the common spaces are
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
being charged at the commercial just the
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
common okay all right excuse me just the
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
common spaces individual unit owners are
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
are clearly entitled to a residential
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
thanks any other
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking our questions I'm just
 
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the text of the bill and the
 
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
Bold section which is the the new
 
01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.310 align:start position:0%
Bold section which is the the new
language

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
says and whether any commercial or
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
business enterprises are permitted so
 
01:13:05.229 --> 01:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
help me understand how that that small
 
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
change accomplishes your goal are there
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprises sometimes run out
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
of the common spaces that we were
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
discussing just help me understand that
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
that uh that's that phrase I I'd be
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
happy to answer your question my
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
intention here was that commercial
 
01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
Condominiums so for example condominiums
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
that have the barber shop in it and the
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant in it and bus cond business
 
01:13:33.199 --> 01:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
restaurant in it and bus cond business
condos

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
condos
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
exactly would this bill does not apply
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
to business condos it applies to
 
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
residential so if I decide to have a
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
business in my
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
barn shouldn't I I say well you give if
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
you if we were to pass this bill
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't I then say well we should they
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
anybody in New Hampshire who has a
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise on their property be
 
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
able to be
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
residential thank you for your question
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
um I think in general um and I I don't
 
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
know of any exceptions that residential
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
Condominiums do not allow individual
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
unit owners to conduct business out of
 
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
their individual units and so the
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
example you gave of the barn would not
 
01:14:29.719 --> 01:14:30.669 align:start position:0%
example you gave of the barn would not
be

01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
applicable right no that's true that
 
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
part it I was just saying is that if
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
if if it's a business like if you have a
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
barber shop assume that's a tenant you
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
know the barber is paying rent and
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's a tenant that sure sounds like a
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
business to me yes but that would be
 
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
done in a condominium that is strictly a
 
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.790 align:start position:0%
done in a condominium that is strictly a
commercial

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
condominium with
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
multi that is a commercial condomini so
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
that one's commercial so we're talking
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
about the hallways open space we're
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the hall things that were
 
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily uh commercially Revenue
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
generating okay I misunderstood you all
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
right great thank you representative
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
Sullivan has a question yeah so I mean
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
I'm supportive with what you're trying
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
to do I'm not sure if I read this
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
language as accomplishing that but maybe
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but it see like I get what
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do but this doesn't
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
sound like it clarifies it but maybe
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
somebody else here has a different read
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
on this but I'm just wondering if maybe
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
this langu if I'm if people agree with
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
me on this maybe this language isn't
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
right and maybe there's an amendment
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
needed or a clarification
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
needed I don't know that's just sort of
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
a what you believe well I would
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
certainly be open to Amendment and to
 
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
working with you and the committee on
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
amendments to
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
it okay representative M oh thank you um
 
01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.470 align:start position:0%
it okay representative M oh thank you um
a

01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
question it's not by law that utilities
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
can charge the commercial rate is that
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
correct they can or they can't my
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
question is will why can't a Condominium
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
Association uh go to another electric
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
provider and say hey they're charging us
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
commercial will you charge us
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
residential and there's different
 
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
providers out there why can't they just
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
negotiate that
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
themselves I think Mr sweat can can
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
offer more direct information on that
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
because he's had the experience with
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
going through this process to try to get
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
residential rates for the Condominium
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
Association but my understanding is in
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
our area it's Unitil who's our default
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh electric company and when the
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association um approached
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
Unitil and said we would like the
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
residential rate they were told no they
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
could not they had to stick with the
 
01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.270 align:start position:0%
could not they had to stick with the
commercial

01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
rate okay yes representative em has
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
another question thank you uh just one
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
one last question thinking about the
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
last few words of uh the new section
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
there it says
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh that do not permit commercial or
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
business enterprises shall be charged
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
the same electric rates as condominium
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
residential units and in our previous
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
bills discussion we were talking that
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
different units can re can have
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
different rates right the the owner can
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
sign up for different services so which
 
01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
which residential units provided that
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
they could have different rates which
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
ones would uh they be required to to to
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
give may I just have a moment to read
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
the language here shall be charged the
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
same electric rates as condominium
 
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.870 align:start position:0%
same electric rates as condominium
residential

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
units um again maybe this needs
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying language because
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.149 align:start position:0%
clarifying language because
obviously

01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
um individual unit owners can as as was
 
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier can choose their own
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
supplier and Community Powers coming
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
forward and so that choice can be made
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
but the intention of the language here
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
is that um commercial rate versus
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
residential rate not commercial rate
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
versus having no choice on the
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
residential rate okay
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question I I I
 
01:18:27.149 --> 01:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
think it's it may need some
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
clarification on in the language but I
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
understand the intent thank you about
 
01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.790 align:start position:0%
understand the intent thank you about
swimming

01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
pools what what about swimming pools is
 
01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
swimming pools common
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
space um I I think so yes I mean some
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
some condominium because they can use a
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
lot of electricity right yes but again
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
it's for a a swimming pool is limited to
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
the unit owners and their guests and
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
families it's not open to the public got
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
like the barber shop correct okay
 
01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.229 align:start position:0%
like the barber shop correct okay

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
bill section one um which is lines one
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
to four require declarations for every

and whether any commercial or business
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%

01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
section two requires condominium
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
associations do that do not permit
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
commercial or business enterprises shall
 
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
be charged the same electric rate as
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
condominium residential units
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
condominium uh associations may have
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
common areas or jointly used facilities
 
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
served by an electric meter or uh
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
numerous meters electric service to
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
these common areas or facilities
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
provides a benefit beyond that provided
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
to an individual home or residence as
 
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
such the use of electricity in common
 
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
areas or common facilities is not
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
residential in nature and thus the
 
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
service provided is appropriately
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
classified as non-residential or
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
commercial New Hampshire's Electric
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
utilities classify service strictly in
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
commercial or residential terms with
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
different rate options available within
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
each broad rate rate class the Bill's
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
language before you would permit
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
condominium associations across the
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
state to delineate their limited common
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
areas and determine whether any
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
commercial or business enterprises are
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
permitted in those areas an electric
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
utility would then be required to
 
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
provide service under its residential
 
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
rates to any common areas that do not
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
have business or commercial Enterprises
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
as written the uh Department believes
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill would have several
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences um the Bill
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
permits condominium associations which
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
has been discussed are commercial
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
entities to determine whether business
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
or commercial Enterprises take place in
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
common areas on their property as a
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
result condo associations rather than
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
the electric utility would have the
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
authority to to determine the rate
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
classification that they fall under and
 
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
they would pay that to their uh utility
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
Service as a result of that shift in who
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
determines the appropriate rate utility
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
there is the potential for the under
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
recovery of costs by the utility and the
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
shifting of costs between residential to
 
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.430 align:start position:0%
shifting of costs between residential to
non-residential

01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
non-residential
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
customers uh final point is the bill
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
inappropriately shifts the determination
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
of an appropriate rate from the utility
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
to the customer themselves allowing a
 
01:22:43.229 --> 01:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association to choose what
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
rate it wants to take service under
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
meters that serve common use areas or
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
common facilities are appropriately
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
classified as providing commercial
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
service to condom condominium
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
associations because condominium
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
associations are commercial entities uh
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
because condominium associations are by
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
natur commercial entities the service
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
provided to those common areas or common
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
facilities is treated as such and they
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
are charged non-residential or
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
commercial tariff rates for those that
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
for that commercial service um with that
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
that closes my testimony uh happy to
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that folks might
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
have but I do want to note I do not live
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
in a condo association I I could not
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
come close to talking about um Condo
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
Association law uh but more than willing
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
to try to answer as much as I can so but
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
you're the enforcer of this of this
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
section the statute so swimming
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
pools swimming pools are they in or
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
out thank you for the question so it
 
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
would depend based on the language of
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is that it well I forget about
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
the bill I want to know current law I
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
assume I assume swimming pools would be
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
considered common facilities common use
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
areas and my mind they're not considered
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
residential in
 
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
nature okay so in your mind this bill is
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh somewhat conflicting to way the law
 
01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:05.639 align:start position:0%
is structured and which is obviously why
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
the bill is in front of us is that uh
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
like this current law
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
yep okay representative
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair uh and thank
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
you for coming to testify uh I live in a
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
condo association um and we have some
 
01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:29.719 align:start position:0%
common use areas a community room a
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
fitness room um a swimming pool and
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
tennis court all of those are restricted
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
to use by condo owners or people who are
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
renting from condo owners essentially
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
people who live within the condo
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
units wouldn't it be different if for
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
instance the condo
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
association were say
 
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
renting out the community room for other
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
events for weddings or other types of
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
events that would clearly be a
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprise so isn't there a
 
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.910 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprise so isn't there a
diff

01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
diff
 
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
differentiation between that commercial
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
situation and the situation that we
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
actually have in our condo development
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
where essentially we have a communal
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
living room and a communal swimming pool
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so on uh which is not available to
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
the public never rented out to
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
anyone isn't that different and wouldn't
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
it be appropriate under those
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances to have a differentiation
 
01:25:38.669 --> 01:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
in the electric rates sure thank you no
 
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the uh thank you for the
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative question thank you for
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
the question representative um I I
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
understand the point of the question but
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I guess I'd like to raise two
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
points is the first one is you are
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
allowing a certain commercial entity a a
 
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association under this bill
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
to delineate where business or
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
commercial activities take place on
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
their property um condo associations are
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
by Nature commercial I mean I there's
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
not going to be a person who walks into
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
the community center as you that you
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned representative to determine
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay today it's being used for a
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
commercial use tomorrow it's going to be
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
used for residential um it is a it the
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill in essence is a is a in our opinion
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
a significant granting of power to a
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
specific subsection of a commercial of
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
commercial entities to allow them to
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
choose what utility rate classification
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
they fall under and that is that is
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
problematic to impose especially on a
 
01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.590 align:start position:0%
problematic to impose especially on a
Statewide

01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
basis for question you may inquire yeah
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
thank you uh but in the situation I was
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
describing where most of the time the
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
community room is used just by the
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
residents but sometimes um it might be
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
rented out for a wedding
 
01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
say what's going to happen there isn't
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
that exactly the situation that you said
 
01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
would never happen that is somebody is
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
deciding presumably the condo board um
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
when it's commercial and when it's not
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
that is it's clearly commercial if it's
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
being rented out for a wedding but is it
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
commercial if it's our communal living
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
room if the thank you for the question
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
so simply put if the property is owned
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
by a commercial entity such as the condo
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
association then that area is deemed
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
commercial and they pay a commercial
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
rate um you know individuals and condos
 
01:27:32.189 --> 01:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
might have their own individual meters
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
for their own condos and they most
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
likely would be paying the residential
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
rate but those common areas where there
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
are certain commercial activities taking
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
place whether or not one is uh paying
 
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
condo dues and that type of thing um by
 
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
Nature these condo associations are
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
commercial entities and therefore they
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative bars
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
no no you're you were going like this is
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
it a faction
 
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
I guess what I want to know is do you
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
think that an amendment could be put
 
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
forth that would um set forth the
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
parameters like in the situation that
 
01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
representative gives gave I mean there
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
are some condos they have common living
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
area that or as she said they're not
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
used for any commercial purposes could
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
could we set up parameters that would
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
clarify so it's not solely at the
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
discretion of the condo or or the uh
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
electric electric company sure and thank
 
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
you for the question so I would say
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
could an amendment be offered sure this
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
is the committee to do that and each of
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
you is entitled to draft any Amendment
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
you want um you know if somebody is if
 
01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
there is an association you know I guess
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
the suggestion about a potential
 
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment we'd like to see any type of
 
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
language um before making any sizable
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
comment but again by nature this is
 
01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
giving a certain section of commercial
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
entities the ability to choose the rate
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
classification that they fall under and
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
that is quite unprecedented um you open
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
the door here where does it stop don't
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
be surprised if other leg if future
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
legislators see other bills come forward
 
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
and say maybe we want one for this this
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
commercial entity this commercial entity
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
is commercial entity and then to um the
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
question that I heard representative
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
melier I hope I'm saying that correctly
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
um mentioned earlier is that commercial
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
entities um as well as residential
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
entities um are able not to just get
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
their power from their default service
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
supplier which it could be Unitil
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
eversource Liberty Utilities they can go
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
out and solicit a competitive electric
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
supplier and by going out and seeking a
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
competitive electric supplier some of
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
those suppliers might have lower rates
 
01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
if the concern here uh from the
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
constituent and I I I will admit I did
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
not know this was a specific constituent
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
issue but if the concern is about um any
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
specific um increase in electric rates
 
01:29:59.109 --> 01:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
or anything like that there is the
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
option out there for consumers both
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
residential and Commercial to shop
 
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
around and find a more competitive rate
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
that might potentially be lower rather
 
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
than going to default service um sorry I
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
kind of segue into his question from
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
earlier but I hope that answers your
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
question representative Herbert and
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're G to make it short and sweet
 
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
would would it be would it be accurate
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
my observation would be is that things
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
like pools larger common areas uh are
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
more expensive and that's what is
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
bothering the
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
utility because in effect you've got a a
 
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
facility that is expensive to have sure
 
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
and you don't want to pay the bill sure
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
and oh sorry they don't pay bills you
 
01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.870 align:start position:0%
and oh sorry they don't pay bills you
pay

01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
them no I'm yes
 
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah okay represent
 
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
no very briefly um if this bill were to
 
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
pass what would the enforcement
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism look like how difficult would
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement be let's let's say they
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
claim a condo claims to not rent out a
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
room but in in in reality they are
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
renting it out who would enforce that uh
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
statute thank you thank you for the
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
question you know it's not abundantly
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
clear at the department we don't have
 
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
people going around knocking on doors
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
and you know what rate classification
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
are you following um I'm assuming that
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
would be something that the electric
 
01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
utilities would certainly be involved in
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh for sure um but obviously if the if
 
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
the statute under this bill allows condo
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
associations the the ability to choose
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
that rate classification for their
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
common areas they're entitled to do so
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
law okay thank you very much thank you
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
very much all right now sir
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mr Swit Richard swiat
 
01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
come on
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
up I keep thinking of Dick sweat or
 
01:31:58.199 --> 01:31:59.790 align:start position:0%
up I keep thinking of Dick sweat or
Richard

01:31:59.790 --> 01:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
Richard
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
sweat but you are you are not a
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
right yeah just make sure that mic's on
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
perfect and you have to pull it pretty
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
close to you too because we want
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
everybody at home to hear you okay
 
01:32:21.149 --> 01:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
perfect well set yeah I've introduced
 
01:32:23.109 --> 01:32:23.119 align:start position:0%
myself before so we'll get right into
 
01:32:25.149 --> 01:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
1430 uh one the purpose is to establish
 
01:32:32.109 --> 01:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
for our Condominium Association a
 
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
uniformity of electric rate schedules
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
for residential condominiums that do not
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
permit commercial or business
 
01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
enterprises to operate presently we have
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
two rate schedules in our Condominium
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
Association for the residents they are
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
in the domestic rate for what
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh I for what was the gentleman's name
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
name robt Robert okay well Mr Robert
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
um Mr Robert's close enough Roberge Ro
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
Bridge Okay think French ah think French
 
01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
Bridge Okay think French ah think French
yes

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.430 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
so we have two rates in our
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
association the domestic rate for
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
residents and we have the commercial
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
rate that applies to our pump house that
 
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
pumps wellwater to our residents the the
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
wellwater is used for domestic purposes
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
we have septic systems that have are on
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
the commercial rate believe me all the
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
Wastewater from from those units is
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
domestic Wastewater it is not commercial
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
Wastewater we have street lights along
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
the condominium and they are built at
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
the commercial rate our position is when
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
we say uniformity of rates we believe
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
that as the statute says it the domestic
 
01:34:15.629 --> 01:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
rate states for domestic use we are of
 
01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
the opinion that wellwater used by the
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
residents septic systems that is still
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
discharge from the residence is domestic
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
SE Wastewater and street lights are for
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
domestic use we have no swimming pool we
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
have no common area for a house or
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
anything like that so that would be
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
uniformity of rates uh the determination
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
for applying electric rate schedule is
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that the power is used
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
for domestic residential purposes and
 
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
not based on the corporation's
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
organizational structure the
 
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
organizational structure would be the
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
argument that was made that condom
 
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
condominiums by definition are
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
commercial entities that is not true if
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
you look at our corporate charter our
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
corporate charter states that it is for
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
the welfare the benefit and the health
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
of the residents of our Condominium
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
Association there is nothing in there
 
01:35:20.669 --> 01:35:20.679 align:start position:0%
that says there anything to do with
 
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
commercial activities in our
 
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
association secondly in the state of New
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would be willing to bet that
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
most condominium associations either
 
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
commercial or residential are
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in fact one of the statutes
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
says that Condominiums can be
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
incorporated it is not unusual to have a
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
condominium Incorporated it is highly
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
unusual to me to have have to come up
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
with the concept that because you are
 
01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
Incorporated you are therefore a
 
01:36:01.229 --> 01:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprise I find that one
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to believe I support for this
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill is definitely a pocketbook issue
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
for Condominiums not permitting who do
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
not permit commercial or business
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
enterprises residential Condominiums
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
have pumps septic systems street lights
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
Etc assign the commercial rate that
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
would benefit from reduced expenses if
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
assign the residential rate there's no
 
01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
question about that uh It is believed
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
that 1430 would favorably affect at
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
least 500 or more North New Hampshire
 
01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.550 align:start position:0%
least 500 or more North New Hampshire
residential

01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
Condominiums I would certainly also say
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we are talking about when we talk
 
01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
about electric rates you know there are
 
01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.270 align:start position:0%
about electric rates you know there are
two

01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
sources of charges in your bill one is
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
for the electric
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
charges himself and he is correct you
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
can go and you can go to North American
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
power you can go to community power you
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
can go to any of those other ones and
 
01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
that will be what you are charged for
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
your use of electricity what we are
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
talking about is the delivery charge the
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
delivery charge uh is a separate charge
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
and that is what we would like to have
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
be the residential rate and not the
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
commercial rate I can tell you that we
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
have a fire Pond we have our airation
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
pump in the fire Pond that airation pump
 
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
comes out from during the cold months
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
during the it is assigned a commercial
 
01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
rate the airra pump in our fire Pond is
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
is assigned a commercial rate because it
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
is built to the association which is a
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
convenient form of having our property
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
manager pay our bills during the months
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
when that airra pump is not operating
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
not drawing a bit of kilowatt hours the
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
delivery charge because it is based on a
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
commercial rate is $42 a month if we
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
were on the residential rate it would be
 
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
like $16 a month there is a substantial
 
01:38:13.149 --> 01:38:13.159 align:start position:0%
difference between these rates and I
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
certainly understand why the department
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
of energy would not like to see a change
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
here now a little bit of History here
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
back in October oober of 2022 we
 
01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
contacted Todd Blackman he is the senior
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
vice president of unel we wrote him a
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
letter asking him to consider putting us
 
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
on domestic rates he assigned that to
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
Mark Lambert Mark Lambert is a vice
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
president in charge of billing so he
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
assigned that to another person who is
 
01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
in charge of billing we had
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
Communications with him and he basically
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
said it is what it is accept what it is
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
and that is it so we went to the uh
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and we spoke to uh
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
Michael CYO uh he could not answer our
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
question so he moved it up to Amanda
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
Nunan Amanda Nunan basically said
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
basically what this gentleman said
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
because you are Incorporated you deserve
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
a commercial rate it's because you're
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
Incorporated that's the reason
 
01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
I can't accept that I I don't think that
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable way to look at this
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
problem so anyway that's what I have to
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
say the uh vineyard's board of directors
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
and the condiment Leadership Council
 
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
support the enactment of
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
testimony any
 
01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much you're
 
01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:50.030 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much you're
very

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
welcome chair Colin Gary diduro who is
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
bill hi good morning again uh Gary
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
didario from the Community Association
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
institutes New Hampshire legislative
 
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
action committee um going to stop by
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
saying that um it's a it's a very loose
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh opposition that we have to the bill
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the intent of the bill the
 
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
idea that a residential condominium
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
would be charged a residential electric
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
rate that makes perfect sense um we
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
support that um that idea again just
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense I I don't know that
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's much argument uh against that
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
and there are certainly those
 
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
condominiums that are strictly
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
residential you just heard from um an
 
01:40:59.070 --> 01:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
owner who said that his condominium has
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
no uh pool no common areas for rental
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
Etc there are many Condominiums like
 
01:41:08.589 --> 01:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
that um there might be no common areas
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
there might be just units that are
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
connected next to each other um all
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
units uh potentially are occupied on a
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
residential basis it is very very common
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
for the condominium instruments to
 
01:41:24.589 --> 01:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
actually prohibit commercial uses uh of
 
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
any kind of the units at a condominium
 
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
and so in those instances when you have
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
a condominium and it's nothing more than
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
a legal fiction and a type of ownership
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
and what's going on there are people
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
just living in their residential units
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
as their primary and personal residents
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think there's any reason
 
01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
why uh they should be viewed as a
 
01:41:49.629 --> 01:41:49.639 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprise that's to the sort
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
of main purpose and intent of the bill
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
um to the language of the bill itself I
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
just have one um sort of clarifying
 
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
comment to make sort of similar uh to
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
the situation uh when we were speaking
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
about the last bill but uh the proposed
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
amendment would add to subsection e of
 
01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.510 align:start position:0%
amendment would add to subsection e of
section

01:42:10.510 --> 01:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
16i uh this language and whether any
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
commercial or business enterprises are
 
01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:19.719 align:start position:0%
permitted and um I just don't think that
 
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
that's necessary
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
um if you stay within 16i but you move
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
down a couple of subsections if you go
 
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
from subsection e down to subsection H
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
you will find the following language and
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
this is all pertaining to what needs to
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
be in the governing instruments section
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
H says a statement of the purposes for
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
which the condominium and each of the
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
units are intended and restricted as to
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
use so in terms of identifying the uses
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the condominium and the condominium
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
units um we have that at 16i it's in
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
subsection H and so um the change to
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
subsection e to add the language about
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
stating whether or not commercial
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
Enterprises are present uh would just be
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
unnecessary language um so again we
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with the concept of this
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
bill um but subsection e uh does not
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
need to be amended because that purpose
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
H okay representative
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um but what
 
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
about the condo associations that do
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
have common areas and going back to my
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
earlier question isn't there a different
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
what you've described in subsection H
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
appears to apply only to units that is
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
units cannot be used for commercial
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
purposes um which makes perfect sense
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
and I suspect there's a similar their
 
01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
similar language in the basic documents
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
of my own condo association I also
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
suspect that our documents forbid
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
commercial usage of the common areas
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
such as renting out the community room
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
for weddings or renting out the swimming
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
pool for children's parties if that is
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
the case wouldn't those also be
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
non-commercial uses that are just as you
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
might say group residential uses and
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
therefore appropriately subject to uh
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
residential rates but wouldn't that
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
require the uh amendment to subsection
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
e so uh thank you for your question um
 
01:44:47.629 --> 01:44:47.639 align:start position:0%
subsection H actually requires the
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
documents to list the use of the
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
condominium and of each of the units um
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
so I think subsection H does cover us at
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
present meaning that with subsection H
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
as it exists already in place any set of
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
condominium documents should include
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
statements as to the use of the
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
condominium and the units so I think we
 
01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
do already have that um and for that
 
01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
reason I don't think section uh
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
subsection e needs to be adjusted uh to
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question about the
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances and whether in my opinion
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh they are residential or commercial I
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
would agree with you that uh in the
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
instance you're describing you're
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
talking about a residential condominium
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh I mentioned earlier that there are
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
some easy cases where there aren't
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
common areas or there aren't clubhouses
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
or swimming pools U those would be the
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
easiest of the cases uh but if we were
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
to expand and say that we're looking at
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
an association that does have a
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
clubhouse or a pool one or the other
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
both what have you um I do still think
 
01:45:55.589 --> 01:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
that there's a difference between
 
01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
whether that Community is a residential
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
Community or commercial Community if
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
everybody who lives there is living in a
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
personal residence and it's being used
 
01:46:08.910 --> 01:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
as uh their residential home um then I
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that you have a commercial
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
condominium and in the same way people
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
with single family homes who enjoy their
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
own lot of land might have a pool and
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make them a commercial
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
venture sure now at their home because
 
01:46:24.589 --> 01:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
there's a pool in the backyard um I
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that change happens at a
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
condominium either and there are
 
01:46:32.189 --> 01:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
actually other areas of law uh in which
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh Condominiums are viewed as being
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
residential or not or whether they pools
 
01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
are considered public or not uh and for
 
01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
those purposes they fall sort of within
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
one bucket of Regulation or another and
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
if a community is using their pool only
 
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
for their community if it is not open to
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
the general public if it's not rented by
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
the local high school for swim team
 
01:46:58.990 --> 01:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
practice or what have you um then that
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
pool is still considered to be a private
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
pool and not a public pool and so if
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
you've got a residential condominium and
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's no business operating on the
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
property and everybody who lives there
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
does so for purposes of their residents
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
and their pool is only used by those
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
residents of the community who live
 
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
there then I I think you're talking
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
about a residential situation there
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be anything commercial
 
01:47:22.199 --> 01:47:23.030 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be anything commercial
about

01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
it okay I I hope you understand he's
 
01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:29.719 align:start position:0%
confirming what you are saying he is but
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
the reason that I I need to ask a
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
question is that the state department of
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
energy representative has just said the
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
exact opposite that under current law
 
01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
any common area in a condo association
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
is inherently commercial commercial
 
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's being used for a commercial
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
area or not and that being so doesn't
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
subsection e actually require this uh
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
amendment in order for those common
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
areas to be charged the residential rate
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
because the the uh witness uh has just
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
said that in his opinion the uh common
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
area should be charged the residential
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
rate but the department of energy has
 
01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
said they should be charged the
 
01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:14.679 align:start position:0%
commercial rate so wouldn't that require
 
01:48:14.679 --> 01:48:15.550 align:start position:0%
commercial rate so wouldn't that require
an

01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
amendment um well he's say he's just
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
saying he's reading us to the what's the
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
current law and in your mind that means
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
to to that given the situation that's
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
going on now the the law needs some law
 
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
not maybe not that one or this one
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
something needs to be corrected because
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
discrepancy and so to ask him I guess I
 
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
think I can clarify actually okay um so
 
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
so this um uh Bill hb1 1430 uh proposes
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
two changes the first is to 16i
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
subsection e that's what I've been
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
referring to in the Condominium Act that
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
change I don't believe is necessary
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
because section H again states that
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a statement of the
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
purposes for which the condominium and
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
each of the units are intended uh but
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes a second change uh
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
that change is to RSA
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
378 section
 
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
6-a uh and that's where they talk about
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the rates and so uh I think that would
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
still be needed in order to effectuate
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
any type of change and we don't oppose
 
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
that piece so it it it's just to the
 
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
extent that I say it's unnecessary I
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
mean just the first section talking
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
about the Condominium Act because the
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
act as it exists already requires a
 
01:49:44.589 --> 01:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose um but 1430 would
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
still need to be passed for the second
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
piece that changes 378 6A that's where
 
01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
we get into the electric rates thank you
 
01:49:54.599 --> 01:50:01.470 align:start position:0%
we get into the electric rates thank you
okay

01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
spear the electricity needed to operate
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
the waste pump the waste uh facilities
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
to operate the um water pumps that kind
 
01:50:12.239 --> 01:50:13.870 align:start position:0%
to operate the um water pumps that kind
of

01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
thing the residential units could not
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
even function as residential units
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
without about that so that's part of to
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
me the residents and it makes sense that
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
we do something about allowing that to
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
be charged at a residential rate because
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
those residences are absolutely useless
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
without that stuff the swimming pool I
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
liken that to the common areas we have
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
in nashille where we have a community
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
swimming pool you can't make any money
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
at it you can't rent it but you can swim
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
in it and that is definitely a
 
01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:46.870 align:start position:0%
in it and that is definitely a
commercial

01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
property so I'm not so sure that these
 
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
common areas with swimming pools and
 
01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
club houses and everything are not
 
01:50:56.069 --> 01:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
commercial property because those of us
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
who live in residential areas do have to
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
pay in our taxes a commercial rate for
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
those very same things and in fact they
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
are part of what makes people attracted
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
to the it's a competition kind of thing
 
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
so I I I would think that that should be
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
a commercial rate but would you agree
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
definitely without any question that
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
things that make
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
the residences even function how could
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
that possibly be
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
commercial I I would agree I think the
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh the Water the sewer the septic
 
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
systems I think all of those things
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
certainly are residential um in my
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
opinion when you start talking about
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
things like clubhouses or pools um then
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's a case by case in other
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
words there are those associations that
 
01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
use their Clubhouse for commercial
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
purposes there are those associations
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
that make their pools uh open in some
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
way shape or form to the public but
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
there are those associations that do not
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
um and at some associations the pool
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
that they have in the backyard is not
 
01:52:02.589 --> 01:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
much difference uh from a use
 
01:52:04.669 --> 01:52:04.679 align:start position:0%
perspective than a pool that anybody
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
might have in their backyard of a single
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
family home meaning that it's used
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
simply by the people who live there as
 
01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
their residents okay I'm ready
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
now the issue here
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
is who owns the
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
title to those things because electric
 
01:52:26.589 --> 01:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
bill is just one of those little things
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
that we pay we pay taxes we pay
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
insurance we
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
cost if the water
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
system is managed and and if you look at
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
the uh uh it's man I believe it's going
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
to be managed by the Association which
 
01:52:57.069 --> 01:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
entity they're the ones who have to
 
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for the
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
insurance maybe even taxes for it but I
 
01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
know I had this conversation once with
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
my selectman when he was talking about
 
01:53:12.189 --> 01:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
uh leech fields and I said um show me
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
where I'm being assessed for my leech
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
field I don't see that so maybe that's
 
01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
not the right answer but all at the end
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the day what the issue if I
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
understand the department of energy
 
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
correctly is who owns
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
title who owns it who has to pay the
 
01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
taxes for
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
it that if we were to pass this
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislation we're now giving tax
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
exemption to entities simply because
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
residential which I think is going to be
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
problematic when it comes comes to taxes
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
it comes to uh insurance
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
payments who who's
 
01:54:00.510 --> 01:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
liable who's responsible if you know and
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to a happy
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
homeowner we are right we own that
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
septic system we own that pump we have
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
to repair we have to we have all those
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities if I understand
 
01:54:17.069 --> 01:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
correctly what's going on here is is
 
01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
that the association technically is the
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
owner not the
 
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
residents and the association is
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
incorporated for other purposes it's
 
01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
Incorporated such
 
01:54:34.589 --> 01:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
as to who's going to pay the taxes who's
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
going to pay on on taxes on time who's
 
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
going to have the Insurance
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
liability and so therefore the the
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
question the the the department of
 
01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
energy is saying is if we were to pass
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation you a you open up the
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
can of worms so what other things could
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
people want to cost shift on but more
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
importantly it's a corporation that owns
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
it not the homeowners if the homeowners
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
want to have pick a
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
homeowner and have them own that water
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
plant that water if they want to have
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
someone else be the ones responsible for
 
01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:17.149 align:start position:0%
someone else be the ones responsible for
insuring

01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
insuring
 
01:55:20.589 --> 01:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
it then then yeah you can get the lower
 
01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
cost and have it to on their meter but
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
if the meter is being paid by somebody
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
else then it has a whole new set of
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
liabilities would you
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
believe uh yes but uh and thank you uh
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
for raising the issue um to answer the
 
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
question uh at Condominiums uh that
 
01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
common area to the extent that the pool
 
01:55:48.069 --> 01:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
is located there or the septic is
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
located there the common area that isn't
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
the units from a legal perspective at a
 
01:55:56.589 --> 01:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
condominium um is understood to be owned
 
01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
by um each of the unit owner each of the
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
unit owners um in their percentage of
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
undivided interest and of the
 
01:56:07.629 --> 01:56:07.639 align:start position:0%
association it right and so if you have
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
an association if you didn't have an
 
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
association if each one of those people
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
had in their
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
deeds it would written in their deeds
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
portion then
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
theoretically you know they that that
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
your utility bill has got but at the end
 
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
of the day that electric bill has got to
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
go to a resident not to an
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
association that's they don't make the
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
department have to go over and make and
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
check and see who's really doing water
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's not what they're asking for
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
they're asking for who is the owner
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
if it's a residence then it should be
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
the resident name on that electric bill
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
not the
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
association so I certainly have no
 
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
dominion over the department and uh we
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
are not the sponsors of of the bill so I
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
can't explain it in the way uh
 
01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily that they would um but as an
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
association um that is uh focused on
 
01:57:17.470 --> 01:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
Community Association living uh and as
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
an attorney practicing in this area uh I
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
would just say that it is uh in the deed
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
to each of the units what their
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
percentage of interest is um and then
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
for tax purposes um associations don't
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
get a bill to you know quote unquote the
 
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
association uh for purposes of taxes the
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities look at the property as a
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
whole to the extent that there's tax
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
value on the common areas or relative to
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
the common areas that's incorporated
 
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
into the tax bills that each of the
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
units get um so there is no one paying
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
taxes other than those units um when it
 
01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
comes to the rest of the bills the
 
01:57:58.589 --> 01:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
associations uh that exist even if they
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
exist as a corporation and they don't
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
all have to um you're not required to be
 
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
a corporation uh that's just one of the
 
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
options for those that that choose the
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
corporate form um you don't necessarily
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
have a business running you don't have
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
profit you don't have an income stream
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
if you're typical residential only
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
condominium and so uh the money that's
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
in that pool is nothing more than what
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
the unit owners are paying as their fee
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
so it it's just sort of a a collective
 
01:58:31.229 --> 01:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue of use or business um
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
but it is all their money um I will say
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
just to sort of add some more depth to
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
the discussion that uh I do practice law
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
in other states uh Beyond New Hampshire
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
and there uh depending on the state you
 
01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes never see a condominium in a
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
corporate form um there are states where
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
um almost everyone is for example a
 
01:58:59.310 --> 01:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
trust uh trust is very common there are
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
also other sort of legal formations uh
 
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
that depending on the state again you
 
01:59:07.069 --> 01:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
may not find corporations involved at
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
all I think in New Hampshire it it may
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
be uh and I'm not sure about this I
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't practicing at the time but I
 
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
think when Condominiums first got
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
popular in New Hampshire it may have
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
just been that the question needed to be
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
answered you know what are these legal
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
entities going to be um and you know the
 
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
the laws for corporate form uh already
 
01:59:29.229 --> 01:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
existed and it was easy to say okay just
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
let them do that paperwork and and
 
01:59:32.669 --> 01:59:32.679 align:start position:0%
register with the state my final
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
question and I and I want everyone to
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
know I was just putting that this is out
 
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
as a cond I'm not Shing I'm I own this
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
or where I am I'm just trying to think
 
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
all of this through so the question is
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
is any other state like Massachusetts do
 
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
you do they have the same they have the
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
similar law uh Massachusetts for example
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
um they're all trust virtually but I'm
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
saying in Massachusetts is it uh is the
 
01:59:58.589 --> 01:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
trust paying the residential rate or the
 
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
commercial rate oh my apologies I I have
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
not looked at the issue in that state so
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer I would really
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate you if you could do a little
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
look around from our states around us
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
sure that'd be great okay representative
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
grassy has a question yeah I just have a
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
really quick question and I was looking
 
02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
at fairness when we were talking about
 
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
some of the utilities that on a site do
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities pay a separate rate
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
completely different from a residential
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
and Commercial rate do you have any idea
 
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
or does anybody from the Department any
 
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
of the department 7 what municipali you
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
can ask him offline over that guy over
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
there I'll ask him offline then that
 
02:00:36.030 --> 02:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
that's outside of my SCH by thank you
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
questions excuse me representative mcer
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
have a question well just a comment I I
 
02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:43.589 align:start position:0%
have a question well just a comment I I
don't

02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:00:46.350 --> 02:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
see just because it's a corporation that
 
02:00:49.149 --> 02:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
is necessarily a commercial Corporation
 
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
it can be a non-commercial corporation
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh we still make nonprofits pay the
 
02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:55.510 align:start position:0%
uh we still make nonprofits pay the
commercial

02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
rate because they only have the utility
 
02:01:01.149 --> 02:01:01.159 align:start position:0%
it only has two rates residential and
 
02:01:02.910 --> 02:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
Commercial and that's what we we're
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with okay thank you very much

03:24:56.990 --> 03:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
1306 okay um
 
03:24:59.870 --> 03:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
so we've had a lot of situations right
 
03:25:02.750 --> 03:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
now where our condu association the
 
03:25:05.189 --> 03:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
board management company um an narts
 
03:25:07.830 --> 03:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
buun are not spending wisely um and not
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
spending within the budget um and due to
 
03:25:13.229 --> 03:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
this we have been informed that we could
 
03:25:15.550 --> 03:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
be looking at a fairly large
 
03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
assessment um
 
03:25:21.670 --> 03:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
for improvements um such as Community
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
lighting um putting arities around the
 
03:25:26.590 --> 03:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
neighborhood due to some construction
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
across the street um that was not dealt
 
03:25:34.110 --> 03:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
with with the town um and other areas um
 
03:25:36.990 --> 03:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
we are currently in stage four of Paving
 
03:25:40.830 --> 03:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
this coming up um and we have many we
 
03:25:43.070 --> 03:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
have 90
 
03:25:46.590 --> 03:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
something units basically um and all of
 
03:25:50.670 --> 03:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
them need new bulkheads new sighting new
 
03:25:53.630 --> 03:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
roofs um we went through 10 years with a
 
03:25:55.870 --> 03:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
management company that did zero
 
03:25:57.070 --> 03:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance and zero Capital
 
03:26:00.670 --> 03:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
Improvements on the project um so we are
 
03:26:04.510 --> 03:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
very far behind um on a lot of issues
 
03:26:08.469 --> 03:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the capital funds to
 
03:26:12.550 --> 03:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
be able to manage all of this um as such
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
we I was a board member for four years
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
um when this management company we have
 
03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
right now came on um and we had worked
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
through a five-year plan to try and get
 
03:26:23.189 --> 03:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
through as many of the projects as we
 
03:26:26.469 --> 03:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
could within the budget that we have um
 
03:26:30.389 --> 03:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
but now that a new board has come on um
 
03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
spending is not being done within that
 
03:26:36.349 --> 03:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
plan and we are coming up to time for a
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
new fiveyear plan and money is just
 
03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
being thrown to things that are not
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
important um and anytime any of us speak
 
03:26:50.189 --> 03:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
up regarding where money is spent and
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
things like that we keep getting
 
03:26:54.590 --> 03:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
threatened with a large assessment from
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
our management company um and thus
 
03:26:59.550 --> 03:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
trickling down to our board really our
 
03:27:01.710 --> 03:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
management company runs the show at our
 
03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
place um the board doesn't have as much
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
of a voice as we would hope um that they
 
03:27:09.389 --> 03:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
would against the management company and
 
03:27:12.670 --> 03:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
the spending um but really we're looking
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
at quite a lot of money out of our
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
pocket um our town taxes just went up
 
03:27:22.830 --> 03:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
our um condo fees just had a second
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
significant increase and it's still not
 
03:27:26.790 --> 03:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
enough money for all these projects and
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
we are basically being
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
um charged out of our homes at this
 
03:27:35.349 --> 03:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
point if a if a large assessment goes
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
through for these due to um
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
inappropriate spending
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:42.229 align:start position:0%
inappropriate spending
elsewhere

03:27:42.229 --> 03:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
03:27:45.830 --> 03:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
um so we would like to have it so that
 
03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
there is a cap to what a special
 
03:27:51.550 --> 03:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
assessment can be PR up by the board and
 
03:27:53.830 --> 03:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
by management without the approval of
 
03:27:56.110 --> 03:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
the homeowners we have a lot of elderly
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
people that live in our neighborhood we
 
03:28:00.510 --> 03:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of really young couples um
 
03:28:02.830 --> 03:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
and it's just right now the board
 
03:28:05.309 --> 03:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
honestly thinks that they have our
 
03:28:08.349 --> 03:28:08.359 align:start position:0%
pockets to just pull money out of as
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
they need to um and we'll just like I
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
said throw money at just whatever they
 
03:28:19.910 --> 03:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.389 --> 03:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.399 --> 03:28:29.070 align:start position:0%
 
add

03:28:29.070 --> 03:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:32.349 --> 03:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
um so my name is Katie porier I live in
 
03:28:36.550 --> 03:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh marac New Hampshire um I'm in support
 
03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
of this because it will help the
 
03:28:42.510 --> 03:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners have more say to it it
 
03:28:46.389 --> 03:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
then um just like a rogue board or a
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
management company that feels empowered
 
03:28:49.359 --> 03:28:53.110 align:start position:0%
management company that feels empowered
to

03:28:53.110 --> 03:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
um push the board or stack the board in
 
03:29:00.630 --> 03:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
their favor to have you know these um
 
03:29:00.640 --> 03:29:02.469 align:start position:0%
their favor to have you know these um
maintenance

03:29:02.469 --> 03:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
03:29:07.750 --> 03:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
um things um addressed such as you know
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
say I know you brought up like the pool
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
earlier um you know what if a
 
03:29:18.910 --> 03:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
pool had a crack in it right in ground
 
03:29:22.189 --> 03:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
pool one pool for whole association
 
03:29:25.070 --> 03:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
right has a crack in it you could
 
03:29:28.349 --> 03:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
essentially just fix that one crack and
 
03:29:31.710 --> 03:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
not have to regrout the whole
 
03:29:35.830 --> 03:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
thing but management then will say or
 
03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
the board will say oh no we're going to
 
03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
do the whole thing all over well you
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
know there's reason reasons of why the
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
majority of homeowners should have a say
 
03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
because it may not be needed you know um
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
and again irresponsible spending or
 
03:29:55.710 --> 03:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
being pushed you know to do one thing or
 
03:29:57.990 --> 03:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
another and not getting the homeowners
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
input because they're not
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
informed so it just it would be helpful
 
03:30:09.710 --> 03:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
heard okay have questions from the
 
03:30:14.309 --> 03:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
committee representative Herbert who's
 
03:30:15.670 --> 03:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
the management
 
03:30:18.269 --> 03:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
company we don't want to
 
03:30:22.550 --> 03:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
know I'd really rather not because we've
 
03:30:27.309 --> 03:30:27.319 align:start position:0%
been kind of threatened with defamation
 
03:30:30.550 --> 03:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits from them as well if we go too
 
03:30:34.269 --> 03:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
far that can be a side
 
03:30:36.910 --> 03:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
not okay represent
 
03:30:39.229 --> 03:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:30:42.510 --> 03:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
coming and giving us your testimony
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
I just want to understand the uh the
 
03:30:46.349 --> 03:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
Dynamics here I I don't have a lot of
 
03:30:48.550 --> 03:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
experience with condos
 
03:30:51.070 --> 03:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
associations um so the the idea of a
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
special assessment uh how often and and
 
03:30:56.229 --> 03:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh what types of things could they be
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
issued for and if I understand you're
 
03:31:02.670 --> 03:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
saying the special assessment has to
 
03:31:06.269 --> 03:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
have it can't exceed 5% of the budgeted
 
03:31:08.189 --> 03:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
amount of uh
 
03:31:11.469 --> 03:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
expenses unless approval I guess that
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
would be in a for in the form of a vote
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
approval of the unit Owners Association
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
could you just explain special
 
03:31:19.910 --> 03:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
assessment and then how would how would
 
03:31:21.870 --> 03:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
approval if it's over 5% how would the
 
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
approval process work
 
03:31:29.790 --> 03:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
so um so a special assessment is an
 
03:31:31.630 --> 03:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
extra amount of money on top of our
 
03:31:34.429 --> 03:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
regular condo fees um it can be assessed
 
03:31:36.550 --> 03:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
at any point in time that the board
 
03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
feels that they don't have the budgeted
 
03:31:41.389 --> 03:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
money to be able to take care of issu as
 
03:31:44.670 --> 03:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
they come up um so another Association
 
03:31:46.750 --> 03:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
that we have friends that live at um
 
03:31:49.110 --> 03:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
they need roofing and sighing they just
 
03:31:52.189 --> 03:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
finished their Paving project and it has
 
03:31:53.830 --> 03:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
been found that within their budget they
 
03:31:56.590 --> 03:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
do not have the money to replace all the
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
roofing and all the sighting in the
 
03:32:00.030 --> 03:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
entire complex they have mold behind
 
03:32:02.790 --> 03:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
their walls they have few other issues
 
03:32:05.189 --> 03:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
and um they have the same management
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
company that we do and that
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
um that amount of Mone it's going to be
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars to replace all of
 
03:32:17.910 --> 03:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
that and that million dollars they're
 
03:32:19.510 --> 03:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
taking out what they do have in their
 
03:32:21.030 --> 03:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvement project and then
 
03:32:23.070 --> 03:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
whatever is left over is being assessed
 
03:32:26.030 --> 03:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
to the homeowners over a two-year period
 
03:32:29.070 --> 03:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
of time so they are looking at almost
 
03:32:33.150 --> 03:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
$5,000 um per every six months um to be
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
paid to the association on top of their
 
03:32:34.960 --> 03:32:35.790 align:start position:0%
paid to the association on top of their
condo

03:32:35.790 --> 03:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
condo
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
fees um and then yes we would like to
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
have this be by a vote of the
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
association um by ballot with um with
 
03:32:48.429 --> 03:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
every homeowner being able to have a a
 
03:32:52.710 --> 03:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
say in this um like they would with
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
other votes being done um such as like
 
03:32:57.910 --> 03:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
board member votes and things like
 
03:33:00.870 --> 03:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
that okay repr
 
03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
repr uh thank you Mr chairman uh I think
 
03:33:07.950 --> 03:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
it was Ashley that mentioned uh that
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
routine maintenance had not been done
 
03:33:14.349 --> 03:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
do you recall for how many years or how
 
03:33:17.110 --> 03:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
long it had it was at least 10 years at
 
03:33:20.510 --> 03:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
least 10 years
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you that makes some interesting
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
information represent
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
grassy yes thank you uh could do you
 
03:33:31.950 --> 03:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
know if your management company has paid
 
03:33:34.950 --> 03:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
a set fee for managing the condo
 
03:33:37.110 --> 03:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
association or are they paid on a as a
 
03:33:39.790 --> 03:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
percentage of the overall budget they
 
03:33:41.830 --> 03:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
are set a set fee fee so there's a
 
03:33:43.830 --> 03:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
what's called a door fee so they are
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
paid a certain amount of money per door
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
in the association so per per household
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and I believe it's close to
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
$38,000 that we're paying them
 
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
yearly um and then um for many
 
03:34:04.110 --> 03:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
associations luckily ours doesn't have
 
03:34:06.510 --> 03:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
this but for many associations um
 
03:34:08.070 --> 03:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
anytime that there is a capital
 
03:34:10.990 --> 03:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
Improvement project the um manag
 
03:34:14.309 --> 03:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
companies are also charging a percentage
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
of that Capital Improvement project for
 
03:34:18.630 --> 03:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
them to quote unquote manage the
 
03:34:22.630 --> 03:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:25.670 --> 03:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
it did you in your budget did you have
 
03:34:28.830 --> 03:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
money allocated for Capital Improvements
 
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
there is a a reserve account which is
 
03:34:33.630 --> 03:34:33.640 align:start position:0%
allocated towards Capital Improvement
 
03:34:37.389 --> 03:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
projects um right now it's running
 
03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
really low gotcha okay represent
 
03:34:44.590 --> 03:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
bur thanks for taking my question um
 
03:34:47.229 --> 03:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
it's a two-part question so there is no
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
limit on the assessment that these comp
 
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
nowhere there is no limit um unless
 
03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's something written in specific
 
03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
bylaws um but ours and I know I have
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
friends that live at four other
 
03:35:01.389 --> 03:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
communities and not one of their bylaws
 
03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
has a limit on what a special assessment
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
could be to their homeowners so and
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
second part of it there must be some
 
03:35:14.110 --> 03:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
Avenue to go for Bad actors like you
 
03:35:15.950 --> 03:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
don't see any other than than to go to a
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer at this point so we have
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
contacted lawyers um and we'll speak
 
03:35:22.389 --> 03:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
upon this later with one of the other
 
03:35:24.710 --> 03:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
bills that's coming up um you can try
 
03:35:26.790 --> 03:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
and contact a lawyer there are no
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
lawyers that actually work with condo
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
law that are not
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
already um associated with
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
associations um so you can try and get a
 
03:35:38.070 --> 03:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer it is we were looking at $10,000
 
03:35:40.269 --> 03:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
for a retainer for a lawyer that does
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
not know no condo law um to then bring
 
03:35:44.910 --> 03:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
us in front of a judge that also does
 
03:35:48.269 --> 03:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
not know condo law um and we would then
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
run also the risk of having to pay the
 
03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
association's legal fees if we were not
 
03:35:55.910 --> 03:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
to win this is there a lawyer in the
 
03:35:59.469 --> 03:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
house on the wrong
 
03:35:59.479 --> 03:36:01.229 align:start position:0%
house on the wrong
side

03:36:01.229 --> 03:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
side
 
03:36:05.150 --> 03:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
two okay
 
03:36:08.710 --> 03:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
so yes representative M thank you Mr
 
03:36:11.070 --> 03:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for coming I'm Tim M you
 
03:36:13.349 --> 03:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
on one of your reps from marac as well
 
03:36:16.830 --> 03:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
um stupid question maybe doesn't the
 
03:36:18.670 --> 03:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
management firm work for the association
 
03:36:20.229 --> 03:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
and if so can't you fire them or
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
threaten to fire them get a different
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
one renegotiate anything so the board
 
03:36:25.550 --> 03:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
can fire the management company with a
 
03:36:28.630 --> 03:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
30-day notice um but right now our
 
03:36:30.910 --> 03:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
current board is very much in favor of
 
03:36:33.710 --> 03:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
our management company um which we are
 
03:36:35.630 --> 03:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
we have found is happening with other
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
associations with the same management
 
03:36:39.870 --> 03:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
company they basically stack the board
 
03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
um they get get the votes they get the
 
03:36:43.790 --> 03:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
proxies they get everything that they
 
03:36:46.510 --> 03:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
need to hold on to the board members
 
03:36:48.630 --> 03:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
that vote in their favor and then they
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
force the other board members out um
 
03:36:54.150 --> 03:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
that don't um they make it very
 
03:36:55.309 --> 03:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
difficult to be on the board if you
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't agree with them uh they make it
 
03:36:58.630 --> 03:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
very difficult to live in your
 
03:37:01.189 --> 03:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
Association if you do not agree with
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
them um based on different things that
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
are said to other homeowners it makes it
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
very hard to live there which is why I
 
03:37:10.070 --> 03:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
actually came off the board um it is not
 
03:37:12.030 --> 03:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
a Pleasant situation when you don't
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
agree with your management company um it
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
does take a 23d vote of the entire
 
03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
Association to remove any contractor on
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
the association and to get that
 
03:37:26.429 --> 03:37:26.439 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote especially with the um
 
03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
number of houses that are flipping to
 
03:37:32.670 --> 03:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
new owners um and just the fact that
 
03:37:36.189 --> 03:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
people just don't want to get involved
 
03:37:37.950 --> 03:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
um or they're being they call the
 
03:37:39.189 --> 03:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
management company and they're being
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
told that they were getting
 
03:37:43.389 --> 03:37:43.399 align:start position:0%
misinformation from their you know their
 
03:37:46.229 --> 03:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
neighbor um it's always misinformation
 
03:37:48.550 --> 03:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of the you know Board
 
03:37:52.389 --> 03:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
of the association and it's it's really
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:57.439 --> 03:37:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
movement

03:37:58.990 --> 03:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
movement
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%

right

03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:44.830 --> 03:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh again for the record Gary
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
didario here on behalf of the Community
 
03:38:49.469 --> 03:38:49.479 align:start position:0%
Association institutes legislative
 
03:38:52.590 --> 03:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
action committee for New Hampshire um I
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm kind of the spoiler today
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
because I think I'm about to do this for
 
03:39:01.950 --> 03:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
the third time um but the statute as it
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
exists already regulates special
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
assessments and that was done fairly
 
03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
recently by the New Hampshire legis
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't even the big
 
03:39:15.950 --> 03:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
2016 Amendment it was one of the
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
subsequent amendments between then and
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
now um but special assessments are
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
presently regulated in section 40c of
 
03:39:27.750 --> 03:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
the statute so we have an amendment here
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
to change section
 
03:39:34.030 --> 03:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
52 uh but at section 40c what it says uh
 
03:39:36.990 --> 03:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
existing law about special assessments
 
03:39:39.790 --> 03:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
is that they must go through exactly the
 
03:39:42.870 --> 03:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
same process as the budget
 
03:39:45.950 --> 03:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
itself so that tells us several things
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
it tells us the community is going to be
 
03:39:49.670 --> 03:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
notified it tells us that there's going
 
03:39:52.349 --> 03:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
to be a meeting and it tells us that
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the community can reject
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
it the same way twoth thirds of the
 
03:39:59.550 --> 03:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
community can reject the budget um and
 
03:40:02.110 --> 03:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
so really all the mechanisms are in
 
03:40:04.269 --> 03:40:04.279 align:start position:0%
place here I believe that if you had a
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
truly Rogue board that for whatever
 
03:40:10.150 --> 03:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
reason was operating very irresponsibly
 
03:40:12.269 --> 03:40:12.279 align:start position:0%
want to spend all kinds of money that
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
the association doesn't have if the
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
situation were very bad if it was what I
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
just described then two-thirds of the
 
03:40:22.750 --> 03:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
community could come to the special
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
assessment meeting and say no thank you
 
03:40:27.630 --> 03:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
we don't want that special assessment
 
03:40:30.510 --> 03:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
and then it simply doesn't happen um
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's the law as it stands
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
today um speaking now more generally
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
about the the bill itself I I think the
 
03:40:41.790 --> 03:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
problem with with it and believe me it's
 
03:40:43.630 --> 03:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
not that I I like the idea of people
 
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
getting hit with special assessments I
 
03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
don't I will tell you that in my
 
03:40:50.830 --> 03:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
practice when I counsel clients I always
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
counsel them to do anything but a
 
03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
special assessment if there's any way
 
03:40:58.189 --> 03:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
you can avoid it you should avoid it a
 
03:41:00.950 --> 03:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
special assessment is a last resort uh
 
03:41:03.710 --> 03:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
frankly the mortgage questioner that
 
03:41:07.110 --> 03:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
lenders use now includes questions about
 
03:41:09.429 --> 03:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
special assessments and I warn my
 
03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
clients of that that if you have special
 
03:41:13.469 --> 03:41:13.479 align:start position:0%
assessments people are going to be
 
03:41:15.710 --> 03:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
answering those questions on mortgage
 
03:41:17.550 --> 03:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
questionnaires and what you're doing is
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
you're actually hurting the
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
marketability of your units because when
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
lenders get the questionnaire back and
 
03:41:25.590 --> 03:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
say oh you do have special assessments
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
you had a special assessment last year
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
those are points against the association
 
03:41:33.670 --> 03:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
and points against that loan application
 
03:41:35.590 --> 03:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
so special assessments are bad in
 
03:41:38.389 --> 03:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
general and they are to be avoided that
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
is the advice that we give cons
 
03:41:43.389 --> 03:41:43.399 align:start position:0%
consistently but if a special assessment
 
03:41:46.950 --> 03:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
were needed then by definition we're
 
03:41:49.110 --> 03:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
talking about something that isn't
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
included in this year's budget and so by
 
03:41:54.510 --> 03:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
definition we're talking about something
 
03:41:57.269 --> 03:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
that apparently we were not expecting
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
and if something unexpected happens and
 
03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
it needs to be fixed or repaired or
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
replaced at an association as it is for
 
03:42:09.030 --> 03:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
any of us wherever we may live um the
 
03:42:10.710 --> 03:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
universe doesn't care about what the
 
03:42:13.790 --> 03:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
cost is it doesn't care about whether
 
03:42:17.429 --> 03:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
that cost is a specific percentage of
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
what our household budget might be the
 
03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
cost just is what it is um what I mean
 
03:42:26.070 --> 03:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
by that is that in a storm like we have
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
now or a or a you know wind driven
 
03:42:31.030 --> 03:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
rainstorm if it's the case that a
 
03:42:34.030 --> 03:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
section of the roof blows off and it
 
03:42:36.630 --> 03:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
turns out that the building needs a new
 
03:42:39.269 --> 03:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
roof again the universe doesn't care the
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
contractors don't care the people who
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
make roof shingles nobody cares what
 
03:42:45.870 --> 03:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
percentage that is of your budget the
 
03:42:47.630 --> 03:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
issue is it costs what it cost and
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when you need a new roof
 
03:42:51.950 --> 03:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
you have to put one on um you know you
 
03:42:54.389 --> 03:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
just don't have a way around that uh for
 
03:42:57.149 --> 03:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
the board should you fail to properly
 
03:42:59.229 --> 03:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
care for the property you're breaching
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
the fiduciary duty that again the the
 
03:43:04.870 --> 03:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
statute as it stands today imposes on
 
03:43:06.429 --> 03:43:06.439 align:start position:0%
the board members and if you're
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
breaching your fiduciary duty then every
 
03:43:11.950 --> 03:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
other unit owner at that Association
 
03:43:13.830 --> 03:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
could potentially bring suit against you
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
for that and as a board member that's a
 
03:43:19.389 --> 03:43:19.399 align:start position:0%
sort of a real catch22 if you're going
 
03:43:21.309 --> 03:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
to have unit owners particularly the
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
ones maybe who live under the roof leak
 
03:43:26.269 --> 03:43:26.279 align:start position:0%
sue you and say we need a new roof the
 
03:43:28.149 --> 03:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
board's not getting a new roof they're
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
in breach of their fiduciary duty and
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
then the board is going to sit in a
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
courtroom and say well we want to
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
replace the roof we just can't get the
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
vote that we need under the
 
03:43:40.269 --> 03:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
statute the fact that that that
 
03:43:44.149 --> 03:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
situation could arise to me sort of
 
03:43:45.870 --> 03:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
tells us all that that generally
 
03:43:47.630 --> 03:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
speaking that's probably not what we
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
want to be doing in the law if we put
 
03:43:52.630 --> 03:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
people who serve in these board
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
positions in those types of predicaments
 
03:43:57.149 --> 03:43:57.159 align:start position:0%
what we're going to see over time is
 
03:43:59.349 --> 03:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
that people just aren't willing to do it
 
03:44:01.229 --> 03:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
they don't want to serve on their board
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
anymore um and then just lastly and
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
really quickly speaking of the board and
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
Property Management uh the comment was
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
made and and I agree and it's just
 
03:44:13.389 --> 03:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
simple reality the property manager is
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
hired by the board and they can be fired
 
03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
by the board um and so the control
 
03:44:20.149 --> 03:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism is there that if for some
 
03:44:21.710 --> 03:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
reason the property management company
 
03:44:24.429 --> 03:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
is the problem um there is a way to get
 
03:44:28.229 --> 03:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
rid of them if the board itself is the
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
problem there's a mechanism there as
 
03:44:32.990 --> 03:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
well uh as I think we all know because
 
03:44:36.149 --> 03:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
again these portions of the statute uh
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
exist as present day regulation and
 
03:44:42.070 --> 03:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
they've been modified fairly recently um
 
03:44:44.910 --> 03:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
boards are constantly up for election at
 
03:44:47.229 --> 03:44:47.239 align:start position:0%
condominium associations and so if you
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
had a rogue board that was really that
 
03:44:52.429 --> 03:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
bad um that was in the pocket so to
 
03:44:54.189 --> 03:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
speak of the property management company
 
03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
and they were doing all the wrong things
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
for all the wrong reasons um then the
 
03:45:00.630 --> 03:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
next annual meeting is an opportunity
 
03:45:03.229 --> 03:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
for the entire Community to vote against
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
them as a board so you can fire your
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
your property manager you can fire your
 
03:45:12.550 --> 03:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
board outside of the election process
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
there again is an existing provision in
 
03:45:17.349 --> 03:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
the Condominium Act as it stands today
 
03:45:21.389 --> 03:45:21.399 align:start position:0%
for the removal of board members and so
 
03:45:22.950 --> 03:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
let's say you find yourself between
 
03:45:24.910 --> 03:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
annual meetings and between elections
 
03:45:27.389 --> 03:45:27.399 align:start position:0%
but you've got board members that are so
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
bad uh that the community can't live
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
with them then the community can act
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
under the removal Provisions that
 
03:45:36.070 --> 03:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
already exist in the statute and remove
 
03:45:37.790 --> 03:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
those board members even if you're
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
between elections so again I I I like
 
03:45:44.429 --> 03:45:44.439 align:start position:0%
the the idea of people not being
 
03:45:47.070 --> 03:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
subjected to expenses that you know they
 
03:45:49.950 --> 03:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
find difficult to pay uh but the reality
 
03:45:51.790 --> 03:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
of the situation is that boards have to
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
be able to take care of the property and
 
03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
when things happen especially the types
 
03:45:58.429 --> 03:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
of things that would warrant a special
 
03:46:00.670 --> 03:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
assessment um the board unfortunately
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't have control over the cost
 
03:46:03.910 --> 03:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're just dealing with whatever the
 
03:46:05.790 --> 03:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
situation is and they're trying to fix
 
03:46:08.790 --> 03:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
it and if the situation is that bad the
 
03:46:10.429 --> 03:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
provisions exist for at the end of the
 
03:46:13.149 --> 03:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
day the community to speak and oust
 
03:46:15.189 --> 03:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
whoever they need to oust if that's
 
03:46:18.269 --> 03:46:18.279 align:start position:0%
what's going on at the association so um
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
just not sure that that this particular
 
03:46:23.590 --> 03:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is necessary um if
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
it is necessary it probably um should
 
03:46:28.070 --> 03:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
come somewhere else in the statute
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
because like I said potentially now you
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
could have a conflict between different
 
03:46:34.590 --> 03:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
sections of the statute if you create a
 
03:46:38.950 --> 03:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
limitation in one um that that doesn't
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
match with what you're doing for a
 
03:46:43.149 --> 03:46:43.159 align:start position:0%
process and
 
03:46:46.189 --> 03:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
another great well um what's the
 
03:46:47.910 --> 03:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
difference between a special assessment
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
and a capital
 
03:46:52.229 --> 03:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
Improvement uh so Capital Improvement is
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
just when you're spending money sort of
 
03:46:57.070 --> 03:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
outside the normal routine so it would
 
03:46:59.469 --> 03:46:59.479 align:start position:0%
be a capital Improvement if you were
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
replacing the roof uh of the building or
 
03:47:04.750 --> 03:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
replacing the siding for the building um
 
03:47:07.269 --> 03:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
the difference being that normally if if
 
03:47:10.269 --> 03:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
things are are going well Community
 
03:47:13.870 --> 03:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
plans for a capital expenditure so if
 
03:47:17.309 --> 03:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
you know your siding is uh
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
$300,000 and you know that your siding
 
03:47:22.710 --> 03:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
is good for 30 years at your condominium
 
03:47:24.870 --> 03:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
um then the math tells you that you put
 
03:47:27.870 --> 03:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
away about $110,000 a month for your
 
03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
next $300,000 Reserve siding project
 
03:47:34.149 --> 03:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
exactly um special assessment would be
 
03:47:36.389 --> 03:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
that again I'll go with my example
 
03:47:38.030 --> 03:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
because it's easy and clear special
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
assessment would be uh let's say for
 
03:47:42.590 --> 03:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
some reason you're at the midpoint
 
03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
you're 15 years into your siding you
 
03:47:48.389 --> 03:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
don't expect to be replacing it yet but
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
a storm blows it off the building or or
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
for some reason it has started to rot
 
03:47:54.990 --> 03:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
and it's falling off the building and
 
03:47:57.389 --> 03:47:57.399 align:start position:0%
now you find yourself doing your siding
 
03:48:00.510 --> 03:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
project years early then even if you
 
03:48:02.429 --> 03:48:02.439 align:start position:0%
were engaged in proper financial
 
03:48:05.189 --> 03:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
planning um you may not have enough to
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
do that siding job when you need to do
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
it and so then Especial assessment
 
03:48:13.070 --> 03:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
happens where um the community just has
 
03:48:15.870 --> 03:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
to raise money to meet their present day
 
03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
needs okay well sounds like uh Capital
 
03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement is the same thing it's just
 
03:48:24.630 --> 03:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't planned on okay that this
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
is not an expense and it wasn't planned
 
03:48:28.189 --> 03:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
you didn't have a budget enough money
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
for the capital Improvement
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
um they got it
 
03:48:37.950 --> 03:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
great representative you thank you Mr
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr diio Dar Dario is that right
 
03:48:43.950 --> 03:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
thanks um thanks for your expertise on
 
03:48:46.349 --> 03:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
on these various laws um so maybe you
 
03:48:48.189 --> 03:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
could review with us a little bit than
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
your interpretation on the
 
03:48:53.149 --> 03:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
2/3 rule because what I heard you say if
 
03:48:57.030 --> 03:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
I understood correctly is that 2/3 can
 
03:48:59.710 --> 03:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
show up and 2third can reject it which
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
would almost imply that you need 100% of
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
those who show up to reject it so you
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
need both 2third for a quorum and then
 
03:49:09.870 --> 03:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
everybody all of those two two thirds
 
03:49:11.950 --> 03:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
have to actually vote to accept or
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
reject I understanding you correctly or
 
03:49:16.149 --> 03:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
but potentially I mean if if only
 
03:49:18.269 --> 03:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the community come to the
 
03:49:20.550 --> 03:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
meeting um then yes to meet the
 
03:49:22.630 --> 03:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
two-thirds voting standard you would
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
need everybody who's there to vote um
 
03:49:27.189 --> 03:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
you know along the same controvery over
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
the years was the fact that that you you
 
03:49:32.429 --> 03:49:32.439 align:start position:0%
need twoth thirds to overturn the board
 
03:49:33.750 --> 03:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
right you know because you're voting on
 
03:49:36.269 --> 03:49:36.279 align:start position:0%
the board's budget you need two at the
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
end of the day it was it was a very high
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
threat threshold and and 2third to for
 
03:49:45.030 --> 03:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
any any action to be
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
taken oh now I remember what the
 
03:49:49.469 --> 03:49:49.479 align:start position:0%
question I want to ask you guys can't
 
03:49:51.990 --> 03:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
bond right you can't go you can't float
 
03:49:54.149 --> 03:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
money or you can't like your if the
 
03:49:57.070 --> 03:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
capital Improvement is so huge because
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
you would have to have every lot every
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
owner condo owner sign on to the to the
 
03:50:04.590 --> 03:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
the mortgage note I mean can you borrow
 
03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
money they can um in fact in recent
 
03:50:10.189 --> 03:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
years because there are so many
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
associations I mean let's face it
 
03:50:14.429 --> 03:50:14.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and and some of us may be
 
03:50:16.830 --> 03:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
guilty of this at our own households
 
03:50:19.229 --> 03:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
whatever type of residence we we may
 
03:50:22.229 --> 03:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
live in um human nature is such that
 
03:50:25.189 --> 03:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's probably the minority of folks um
 
03:50:28.189 --> 03:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
that actually plan so properly that when
 
03:50:29.670 --> 03:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
the roof needs to be replaced the
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
money's sitting there when the siding
 
03:50:32.950 --> 03:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be replaced the money's sitting
 
03:50:34.630 --> 03:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
there you know generally speaking
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
something gets in the way there's not a
 
03:50:39.070 --> 03:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
lot of uh perfect financial planning
 
03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that goes on in general um in
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
recent years because so many
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
Condominiums are of that age now that
 
03:50:48.830 --> 03:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
these major components need to be
 
03:50:50.950 --> 03:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
changed over if the if the building of
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
Condominiums if the Heyday was in the
 
03:50:54.990 --> 03:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
80s um you know then then they're 40
 
03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
years old now they need all of these
 
03:51:00.149 --> 03:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
things um banks in recent years have
 
03:51:01.389 --> 03:51:01.399 align:start position:0%
realized that there are so many
 
03:51:03.630 --> 03:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
condominiums in that position that
 
03:51:06.030 --> 03:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
there's a market for a so-called
 
03:51:08.510 --> 03:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
condominium loan oh that's good and they
 
03:51:11.110 --> 03:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
have created needed uh products
 
03:51:13.149 --> 03:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
specifically for that segment of the
 
03:51:15.269 --> 03:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
market and what they do in the case of a
 
03:51:17.710 --> 03:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
condominium to deal with the fact that
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know the common areas are owned by
 
03:51:22.110 --> 03:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
everybody and this is kind of a messy
 
03:51:24.229 --> 03:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
situation how do we as the bank protect
 
03:51:27.269 --> 03:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves um what they've established
 
03:51:29.429 --> 03:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
are that standard loan documents for
 
03:51:32.670 --> 03:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
condominium Loan Today use as
 
03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
collateralization for the loan the
 
03:51:38.710 --> 03:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
income stream of the assessments that
 
03:51:40.510 --> 03:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
the assoc assciation is entitled to
 
03:51:43.710 --> 03:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
collect from the owners and so if a
 
03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association defaults on a
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
bank loan at least one that's been done
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
with standard docs in recent years um
 
03:51:53.349 --> 03:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
the bank can step in and start
 
03:51:56.670 --> 03:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
intercepting that Revenue stream of the
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
of the assessments that are being paid
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
by the unit owners into the association
 
03:52:03.830 --> 03:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
so as with any of us it's not without
 
03:52:05.790 --> 03:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
risk um you know if you don't pay the
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
bank you get foreclosed on um that sort
 
03:52:09.630 --> 03:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
03:52:11.950 --> 03:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh but the product does exist uh and
 
03:52:14.149 --> 03:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
there are many associations that take
 
03:52:17.790 --> 03:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
advantage of it and um I I can say in in
 
03:52:21.030 --> 03:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
my practice uh I have not yet seen an
 
03:52:24.030 --> 03:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
association that has uh defaulted on a
 
03:52:25.870 --> 03:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
bank loan typically but you have seen
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
some taking this loans out oh yes
 
03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely um it's getting to be quite
 
03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
common which is why banks have sort of
 
03:52:35.309 --> 03:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
structured it as its own product they
 
03:52:38.469 --> 03:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
have their own um closing documents for
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
that type of loan um I haven't seen any
 
03:52:43.229 --> 03:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
associations fall into trouble because
 
03:52:45.510 --> 03:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
generally speaking they do the math at
 
03:52:47.469 --> 03:52:47.479 align:start position:0%
the outset and they just always make
 
03:52:49.510 --> 03:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
sure that they can pay the loan and the
 
03:52:51.630 --> 03:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
most common way that I see them doing it
 
03:52:53.710 --> 03:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
is they add the loan payment as a line
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
item in their budget um so it won't be a
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
special assessment it'll be part of the
 
03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
line item of the budget correct okay
 
03:53:02.520 --> 03:53:03.910 align:start position:0%
line item of the budget correct okay
represented

03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
represented
 
03:53:06.510 --> 03:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um I just wanted to
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
clarify something from personal
 
03:53:11.550 --> 03:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
experience which is that um condo
 
03:53:15.870 --> 03:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
associations can uh borrow uh and do
 
03:53:19.590 --> 03:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
borrow for unexpected uh Capital
 
03:53:23.750 --> 03:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
needs uh but then the owners have to
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
approve either a special assessment and
 
03:53:31.630 --> 03:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
therefore no need to borrow or um uh
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
collections over a period of time so
 
03:53:36.469 --> 03:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
that when the loan comes due there will
 
03:53:38.630 --> 03:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
be enough money there to pay the loan
 
03:53:38.640 --> 03:53:40.429 align:start position:0%
be enough money there to pay the loan
off

03:53:40.429 --> 03:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
off
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
got it just what I
 
03:53:47.309 --> 03:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
heard okay representing M you thank you
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just one more question then
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
if if I understand you correctly the uh
 
03:53:52.319 --> 03:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
if if I understand you correctly the uh
that

03:53:53.510 --> 03:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:53.520 --> 03:53:55.870 align:start position:0%
that
2third

03:53:55.870 --> 03:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
2third
 
03:53:58.510 --> 03:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
majority could be changed that threshold
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
could be changed in the condo document
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
by a two-third majority right so you
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
could no it's statutory no I I I know
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
but you couldn't you couldn't say
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that you you could was
 
03:54:12.070 --> 03:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
that was why we get bills every year
 
03:54:14.309 --> 03:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
about this issue right what so it's
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
government by minority the onethird can
 
03:54:19.229 --> 03:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
tell the rest what to do simply well
 
03:54:22.830 --> 03:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's simply by not showing up sorry
 
03:54:26.550 --> 03:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'll wait go ahead um so it's it's
 
03:54:28.469 --> 03:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
governed by the board in the first
 
03:54:29.830 --> 03:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
instance in other words the the
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
community elects the board right uh it's
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
the board's job to sort of figure out
 
03:54:36.070 --> 03:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
the finances manage the property see
 
03:54:39.550 --> 03:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
what projects need to happen um if the
 
03:54:43.349 --> 03:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
board imposes a special assessment um
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
then it takes two-thirds of the
 
03:54:48.070 --> 03:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
community to overrule uh what the board
 
03:54:50.590 --> 03:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
is is doing so the solution is get on
 
03:54:52.469 --> 03:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
the board and then just get your friends
 
03:54:54.309 --> 03:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
on the board or whatever
 
03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
and running theory is that that those
 
03:54:58.590 --> 03:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
are elected positions and if people
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
don't like what the board is doing then
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
then throw them off vote them offe them
 
03:55:05.309 --> 03:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
off and just to address the the first um
 
03:55:07.590 --> 03:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
part of the question uh in the section
 
03:55:09.550 --> 03:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
of the statute that talks about the two3
 
03:55:11.309 --> 03:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
voting standards for different things
 
03:55:13.950 --> 03:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
including amendments and so on um the
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
statute say already says um except if
 
03:55:21.149 --> 03:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
the condominium documents require a
 
03:55:24.389 --> 03:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
larger percentage um so they don't go
 
03:55:26.269 --> 03:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
smaller but they do allow communities
 
03:55:29.429 --> 03:55:29.439 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to require more buyin
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
happens further question how how would
 
03:55:38.910 --> 03:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
you or your group feel about lowering
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
the threshold to
 
03:55:44.269 --> 03:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
35ths 60% instead of
 
03:55:44.279 --> 03:55:46.030 align:start position:0%
35ths 60% instead of
66.66%

03:55:46.030 --> 03:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
66.66%
 
03:55:49.110 --> 03:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
I mean I I guess the problem is the the
 
03:55:52.149 --> 03:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
two-thirds got set um just a few years
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
ago really and there was a lot of debate
 
03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
about it as I recall um at that time and
 
03:56:00.870 --> 03:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
part of what happened was we saw like a
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
line of of board members they couldn't
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
be contained in the room some of them
 
03:56:06.910 --> 03:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
had to be called in from outside to
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
speak and people were basically saying
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
if you're going to saddle me with the
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty to take care of the
 
03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
property properly and then you're going
 
03:56:17.070 --> 03:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
to tell me that the community who by the
 
03:56:20.110 --> 03:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
way no one ever wants to pay more bills
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
I mean none of us do regardless of of
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
what it is or or why it is but what the
 
03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
board members are saying is if you're
 
03:56:27.990 --> 03:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to saddle us with a fiduciary duty
 
03:56:30.189 --> 03:56:30.199 align:start position:0%
to care for the property properly then
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell us that if the wind
 
03:56:34.830 --> 03:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
blows off the siding or the siding rot
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
and we say we're doing a siding project
 
03:56:38.349 --> 03:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
the community comes out and says no
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
we're not not now we can't even do the
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
job that we've been elected to do and
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
that we have a fiduciary obligation to
 
03:56:47.229 --> 03:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
do and what we heard was board member
 
03:56:49.790 --> 03:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
after board member sat here and said if
 
03:56:51.990 --> 03:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
you pass this I'm going to resign I'm
 
03:56:53.790 --> 03:56:53.800 align:start position:0%
never going to serve on the board again
 
03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
so at at some point it gets difficult to
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
find people to fill these volunteer
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
positions to be in charge of the
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
condominium because it's a bit of a
 
03:57:02.319 --> 03:57:03.750 align:start position:0%
condominium because it's a bit of a
thankless

03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%

03:57:07.070 --> 03:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
job so we uh I can have my researcher

show you the history that we revisit
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%

03:57:45.830 --> 03:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
it differently because you know I see
 
03:57:47.950 --> 03:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
things from a different perspective I I
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
personally am involved with an
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
association in miramac that's about 21
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
or 22 years old and here's how it's done
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
correctly from the day that the
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
association was built they had a reserve
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
study done now I'm sure you're familiar
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
with that it's it's a engineering
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
actuary that gives it the life expense
 
03:58:08.910 --> 03:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
expectancy of roof Paving siding then
 
03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
the cost to how much you have to save uh
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
to achieve those goals at the time that
 
03:58:13.760 --> 03:58:15.189 align:start position:0%
to achieve those goals at the time that
it's

03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:58:17.429 --> 03:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
replaced they set their fees
 
03:58:19.389 --> 03:58:19.399 align:start position:0%
appropriately back when they were first
 
03:58:22.670 --> 03:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
built I won't say high I won't say low
 
03:58:24.550 --> 03:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
they set their fees appropriately to
 
03:58:27.309 --> 03:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
save for those issues that are going to
 
03:58:30.149 --> 03:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
come up down the road they're now in the
 
03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
process of a
 
03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
three-year roof replacement project for
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
about 1.8 million they're writing a
 
03:58:40.429 --> 03:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
check because they followed the reserve
 
03:58:43.590 --> 03:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
study the boards the fiduciaries were
 
03:58:47.070 --> 03:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
proactive in setting the fees to pay for
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
those and now they can write checks and
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
not have assessments or increase fees or
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
bank loans they've structured this out
 
03:58:57.790 --> 03:58:57.800 align:start position:0%
through the years to pay for these items
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
and the board is very good and yes
 
03:59:02.510 --> 03:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
elections come up and sometimes board
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
members change and the community members
 
03:59:06.830 --> 03:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
change the board members and as far as
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
management goes management does not have
 
03:59:12.429 --> 03:59:12.439 align:start position:0%
a vote on the budget the budget is set
 
03:59:14.229 --> 03:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
by the board management can have its
 
03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
input maybe where some line items need
 
03:59:19.710 --> 03:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
to change but the board sets the budget
 
03:59:22.030 --> 03:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
as the governing board and as the
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries then from there it goes to
 
03:59:27.910 --> 03:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
the unit owners for the vote and I can
 
03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
tell you doing this for almost 40 years
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
I've never seen an association reject a
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
vote or a budget because back to uh
 
03:59:36.239 --> 03:59:37.429 align:start position:0%
vote or a budget because back to uh
Gary's

03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
Gary's
 
03:59:40.670 --> 03:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
point legislator and in its wisdom put
 
03:59:42.630 --> 03:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
board members as fiduciaries because you
 
03:59:43.950 --> 03:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
can take
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
356b run it down to two things the
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
boards are infrastructurally and
 
03:59:51.990 --> 03:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
financially responsible for the
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of that Association that
 
03:59:57.469 --> 03:59:57.479 align:start position:0%
is it you can we can have all the laws
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
we want but the board member the buck
 
04:00:01.630 --> 04:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
stops with them and if the board's over
 
04:00:03.950 --> 04:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
the years because I happen to be on the
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
management side if we take over an
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
association that has not been managed
 
04:00:11.870 --> 04:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
well for years and capital projects were
 
04:00:14.670 --> 04:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
not planned for or budgeted they have to
 
04:00:17.750 --> 04:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
get done somehow and shame on those
 
04:00:19.870 --> 04:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
boards in the past that did not plan for
 
04:00:21.990 --> 04:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
that on the good example that I showed
 
04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
you and many associations and boards and
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
community members are saddled with a
 
04:00:30.910 --> 04:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
deficit because the the rate of
 
04:00:33.790 --> 04:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
deterioration and the rate of inflation
 
04:00:37.269 --> 04:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
far exceed that of which boards are
 
04:00:39.429 --> 04:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
raising the fees to be able to take care
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
of those elements so as that Gap expands
 
04:00:46.110 --> 04:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
at some point there has to be some type
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
of either bank loan uh assessment or
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
increase fees to close that Gap and get
 
04:00:55.469 --> 04:00:55.479 align:start position:0%
the capital projects completed because
 
04:00:57.429 --> 04:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
what happens with that is if the capital
 
04:00:59.189 --> 04:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
projects are not completed and things
 
04:01:02.309 --> 04:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
aren't done the value of the property
 
04:01:06.670 --> 04:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
declines that hurts everybody so it's
 
04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's a real it's it's a real Balancing
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
Act and to saddle with just 5% can harm
 
04:01:15.550 --> 04:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
an association because those things need
 
04:01:18.189 --> 04:01:18.199 align:start position:0%
to be done and there is and there are
 
04:01:21.070 --> 04:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place to make sure that
 
04:01:23.550 --> 04:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
those costs can be contained we have
 
04:01:25.269 --> 04:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
worked with associations that have done
 
04:01:28.189 --> 04:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
dozens of bank loans never one defaulted
 
04:01:30.030 --> 04:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
and we take those bank loans in that
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
budget to the owners for approval and
 
04:01:33.910 --> 04:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
they were always passed because the
 
04:01:35.550 --> 04:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
owners realize that there's going to be
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
new this this and it's all outlined and
 
04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
you you can't get a bank loan for a
 
04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
project and do another project with that
 
04:01:43.910 --> 04:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
money the bank loan has to be for the
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
project that is stated so the mechan
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
mechanisms are in place and there's a
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
lot of good in the world that happens
 
04:01:52.349 --> 04:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
with all of this and I gave you an
 
04:01:54.269 --> 04:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
example when it's done right and I feel
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
very bad for associations that have not
 
04:01:58.830 --> 04:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
been either the board has not done their
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
duties or the management has not done
 
04:02:03.149 --> 04:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
their duties and as far as management
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
taking a fee um managements do take does
 
04:02:09.670 --> 04:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
does earn a fee if it's in the in the
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
management agreement and most management
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
agreements is if the board chooses to
 
04:02:18.229 --> 04:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
elect to have that management company
 
04:02:20.149 --> 04:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
oversee the project they could have an
 
04:02:22.670 --> 04:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
engineering Pro uh company oversee the
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
project or they could have management or
 
04:02:26.990 --> 04:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
many boards do it themselves and avoid
 
04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
the fee so that is an option it's not
 
04:02:33.990 --> 04:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory so I want to put a little
 
04:02:36.149 --> 04:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
oxygen back in the room that perhaps
 
04:02:38.309 --> 04:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
maybe this process isn't as bad as it it
 
04:02:40.630 --> 04:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
seems because democracy can and it does
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
work and I've seen it work for four
 
04:02:47.149 --> 04:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:49.229 --> 04:02:49.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:02:50.670 --> 04:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
much I can't I can't compete with the
 
04:02:52.830 --> 04:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
lawyers so
 
04:02:55.269 --> 04:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
maybe but well that's why I insert you
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
between the two of them thank you thank
 
04:03:01.550 --> 04:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
you do do you have written
 
04:03:01.560 --> 04:03:03.510 align:start position:0%
you do do you have written
testimony

04:03:03.510 --> 04:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:03:06.389 --> 04:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
Paul did did you have written
 
04:03:10.630 --> 04:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
testimony okay uh Dean obviously thank
 
04:03:13.349 --> 04:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr Hunt uh and good afternoon uh
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
Dean Lennon for Cai so I won't I'm
 
04:03:17.630 --> 04:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
trying not to repeat anything anyone
 
04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
said but when the two individuals
 
04:03:21.750 --> 04:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
testified as to why this bill is
 
04:03:23.469 --> 04:03:23.479 align:start position:0%
necessary the things I heard them talk
 
04:03:26.149 --> 04:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
about was spending for Paving siding and
 
04:03:28.269 --> 04:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
roofs these are things that boards are
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
charged with maintaining and repairing
 
04:03:33.630 --> 04:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
and replacing so to hamstering the board
 
04:03:36.510 --> 04:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
by putting a decision to redo roofs and
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
what could be more important leaving it
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
up to a community vote where it can be
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
rejected simply because people don't
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
want to pay for it you really put a huge
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
hurdle uh in in front of the board who's
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
trying to fulfill their FID fulfill
 
04:03:52.950 --> 04:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
their fiduciary duty to the condominium
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
itself and what happens if the community
 
04:03:57.750 --> 04:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
rejects it and you've got a roof that's
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
leaking on units and every time there's
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
a storm you have four or five unit
 
04:04:04.830 --> 04:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
owners with $1,000 worth of damage in
 
04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
their unit what are they going to do
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to sue your cont minum so
 
04:04:11.389 --> 04:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
you might have saved the money for this
 
04:04:13.590 --> 04:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
additional assessment but now you've
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
been sued and maybe you lose your
 
04:04:17.349 --> 04:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
insurance or at a minimum your uh
 
04:04:19.990 --> 04:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
premium is going to go
 
04:04:23.830 --> 04:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
up just to hit on this point it's
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
section 40c already strikes a balance by
 
04:04:28.590 --> 04:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
giving the 23ds the ability to veto a
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
budget so we've already kind of dealt
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
with this issue uh ad nauseum in the
 
04:04:37.389 --> 04:04:37.399 align:start position:0%
past there are a couple of deficiencies
 
04:04:39.790 --> 04:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill has written one is it
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
says the approval of the unit owners we
 
04:04:43.750 --> 04:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what percentage that
 
04:04:46.269 --> 04:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
requires it's proposed to be in section
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
52 uh which is what the contents of the
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
public offering statement for a condo
 
04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
this really should be in 40c if it's
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere of course I don't think it
 
04:04:56.030 --> 04:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
should be anywhere but if it's anywhere
 
04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
it should be in
 
04:05:00.110 --> 04:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
40c um and it uses the word improvements
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
which as I discussed earlier is sort of
 
04:05:03.229 --> 04:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
a term of art when it comes to
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
Condominiums an improvement is something
 
04:05:07.950 --> 04:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
new uh but really it seems to me we're
 
04:05:09.790 --> 04:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
talking about Capital expenditures for
 
04:05:13.070 --> 04:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
existing common elements but um in in my
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
estimation uh this uh this bill is a
 
04:05:18.429 --> 04:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
tremendous impediment to the ability of
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
a board to fulfill its fiduciary duties
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
and for that reason you should reject
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much thank
 
04:05:31.070 --> 04:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
you okay I have no more
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
cards so I'm close the public
 
04:05:37.590 --> 04:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and as soon as the clerk's ready
 
04:05:44.189 --> 04:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:47.670 --> 04:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
1357 good afternoon again um I'm
 
04:05:50.149 --> 04:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative Janine ner I'm the
 
04:05:51.790 --> 04:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and for the same
 
04:05:53.950 --> 04:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
reasons for the last one I had
 
04:05:55.950 --> 04:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
constituents approach me and and you you
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
will fill out a card right yes for both
 
04:06:01.349 --> 04:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
of them um and if it's all right with
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
you I would like to have the same two
 
04:06:04.510 --> 04:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
constituents come up and explain the
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill to you that'd be
 
04:06:06.800 --> 04:06:33.910 align:start position:0%
bill to you that'd be
great

04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:37.189 --> 04:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you again for hearing from us um
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
04:06:38.399 --> 04:06:41.590 align:start position:0%
and this is
is

04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:45.389 --> 04:06:45.399 align:start position:0%
1357 yep okay um so I'd like to say that
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
I we are asking for this bill um because
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
it would cause boards and management to
 
04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
be more transparent with their
 
04:06:55.309 --> 04:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
homeowners um again I was on the board
 
04:06:57.630 --> 04:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
for over four years in our association
 
04:07:00.149 --> 04:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
and in that time we had had one closed
 
04:07:02.510 --> 04:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
board meeting um and we closed that
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
board meeting because of a large rockus
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
that was that was um cause that we
 
04:07:09.790 --> 04:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't even speak because the
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
homeowners just wouldn't allow us to
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
talk and that was the only time we'd
 
04:07:16.710 --> 04:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
ever closed a board meeting to our
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
association um so right now what is
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
occurring is um our board is only
 
04:07:27.030 --> 04:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
opening the the sessions basically for
 
04:07:30.790 --> 04:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
that one and a quarter um that they are
 
04:07:33.389 --> 04:07:33.399 align:start position:0%
that they are required to do by the law
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
um at this time um they talk about
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
wanting to be transparent
 
04:07:39.750 --> 04:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
um with the homeowners and wanting the
 
04:07:42.149 --> 04:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
homeowners to be educated as to what's
 
04:07:43.309 --> 04:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
going on with the
 
04:07:47.149 --> 04:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
association and they talk about how you
 
04:07:49.630 --> 04:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
know just ask questions just just call
 
04:07:51.910 --> 04:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
management ask the question we shouldn't
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
have to ask the question if we can sit
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
there and listen to the board meeting
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for every single board
 
04:08:00.109 --> 04:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
meeting to be open for us to speak we're
 
04:08:02.189 --> 04:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
asking for every Bo for the the monthly
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
board meetings to be allowed for
 
04:08:06.189 --> 04:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
homeowners to be able to listen to what
 
04:08:09.030 --> 04:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
is going on um executive session is
 
04:08:11.149 --> 04:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
closed to all homeowners as it should be
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
um as that is most that is all legal
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
things that are going on but for the
 
04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
general comings and goings of the
 
04:08:19.309 --> 04:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
association the homeowners should be
 
04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
able to hear what is going on and we
 
04:08:23.550 --> 04:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
should know what is being voted on who
 
04:08:25.469 --> 04:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
is voting on what if we choose to be
 
04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
there to listen to this
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
um uh right now just
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
from experience that we've had and
 
04:08:37.269 --> 04:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
experience that many of our friends in
 
04:08:40.149 --> 04:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
town at other associations have had um
 
04:08:42.830 --> 04:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's come to the feeling that the board
 
04:08:45.269 --> 04:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
and Management Field that an informed
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
homeown owner is a pain or a difficulty
 
04:08:52.269 --> 04:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
um unless they can direct the narrative
 
04:08:56.229 --> 04:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
that is being sent out to the homeowners
 
04:08:58.670 --> 04:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
um normally you would have meeting
 
04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
minutes that you would be able to go
 
04:09:02.149 --> 04:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
back to to see what was voted on and
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
comments our association has no meeting
 
04:09:08.109 --> 04:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
minutes posted since November of 202
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
two we have asked for them to be posted
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
um they are not um this is not the first
 
04:09:16.109 --> 04:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
time this has happened this is actually
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
the third time that this has happened
 
04:09:20.429 --> 04:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
where it has been multiple months that
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
no homeowner knows what has been voted
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
on what has been discussed at the board
 
04:09:26.910 --> 04:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
meetings um unless they are actually
 
04:09:31.630 --> 04:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
able to be there so we are asking for um
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
this to be more than just once every
 
04:09:35.469 --> 04:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
quarter that a homeowner is allowed to
 
04:09:36.910 --> 04:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
come and sit and listen to these board
 
04:09:39.309 --> 04:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
meetings so that we are aware of what's
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
going on on our association we're aware
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
of what decisions are being made by our
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
board and who's making those decisions
 
04:09:49.109 --> 04:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
we have the responsibility at the annual
 
04:09:51.710 --> 04:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
meeting to vote on whether or not we are
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
keeping the board members that are up
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
for reelection or if we're going to
 
04:09:58.469 --> 04:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
choose another member that has decided
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
another homeowner that has decided to
 
04:10:02.070 --> 04:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
speak up and decide that they wanted to
 
04:10:04.269 --> 04:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
join the board but how are we to do that
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
if we don't know what's being voted on
 
04:10:09.189 --> 04:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
who's being voted um and all of that and
 
04:10:11.550 --> 04:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
if we're not actually able to sit there
 
04:10:16.950 --> 04:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
associations um representative burough
 
04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question just
 
04:10:23.309 --> 04:10:23.319 align:start position:0%
curious do do you think that it's one
 
04:10:26.429 --> 04:10:26.439 align:start position:0%
size fits all and that every Association
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
does need needs to meet monthly I think
 
04:10:31.870 --> 04:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good I I I don't think that
 
04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
everyone probably needs to meet monthly
 
04:10:35.670 --> 04:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller associations might
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
be able to manage most of their stuff um
 
04:10:42.149 --> 04:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
without it um our current bylaws in our
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
association says that we're supposed to
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
have a monthly meeting um we have a very
 
04:10:49.149 --> 04:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
good siiz Association we have 145 units
 
04:10:51.389 --> 04:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
um and as said previously we have a lot
 
04:10:53.550 --> 04:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
of Maintenance and a lot of Capital
 
04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
Improvements and a lot of other things
 
04:10:57.510 --> 04:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
that are going on that us homeowners
 
04:11:00.910 --> 04:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
should know is going on and is happening
 
04:11:03.469 --> 04:11:03.479 align:start position:0%
and as having a large Association it's
 
04:11:04.870 --> 04:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
nice to be able to sit there and listen
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
to what is our board doing for us what
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
are they spending our money on what are
 
04:11:12.429 --> 04:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
you know what are we what are we voting
 
04:11:16.830 --> 04:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
for them to continue to represent us
 
04:11:21.790 --> 04:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
for um so I think you know for for many
 
04:11:24.189 --> 04:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
especially the larger associations that
 
04:11:27.309 --> 04:11:27.319 align:start position:0%
do currently hold monthly meetings um I
 
04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
think it's good for them to continue to
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
happen but I think that they should be
 
04:11:32.109 --> 04:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to have the homeowners be there
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
to listen to it um again executive
 
04:11:37.469 --> 04:11:37.479 align:start position:0%
sessions completely separate that that's
 
04:11:38.830 --> 04:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
all the legal stuff that's all the stuff
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
that you know is not privy to the
 
04:11:43.229 --> 04:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
homeowners and that's fine but any of
 
04:11:45.389 --> 04:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
the normal day-to-day business if a home
 
04:11:47.229 --> 04:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
owner wants to know what's going on and
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
wants to be informed we should be able
 
04:11:51.790 --> 04:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
to sit there and listen again not having
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
to comment and not having to have an
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
open homeowner session where we can
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
speak every time but we should at least
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
be able to listen um it's just like Town
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
meetings and legislative meetings and

I'll just go straight into our position

I'll just go straight into our position

the board of directors of The Vineyards

and the hills at Crockett Farms oppose
 
04:13:26.830 --> 04:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
the enactment of
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%

b35 which states that she'll be recorded
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%

of the condominium buying Association of
 
04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
all unit owners this amendment mandating
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings by the state is
 
04:13:47.590 --> 04:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
contrary to the concept of
 
04:13:50.349 --> 04:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
self-government a meeting is unnecessary
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
for the amount in nature of business
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%

our associations with the existing

statute the association has the option
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
option to call a monthly meeting if
 
04:14:07.149 --> 04:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
necessary we go four quarterly meeting
 
04:14:09.429 --> 04:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
meetings a year board members are
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers today finding unit owners to
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
serve on boards and committees is
 
04:14:17.429 --> 04:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
difficult to mandate 13 yearly meetings
 
04:14:19.630 --> 04:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
compared to the present requirement of
 
04:14:22.109 --> 04:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
four meetings will further exacerbate
 
04:14:24.550 --> 04:14:24.560 align:start position:0%

you okay next is well let's go in
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:56.910 --> 04:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
first thank you uh for the record Dean
 
04:14:59.550 --> 04:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
Lennon Cai New England what I would
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
encourage this board not to do is to
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
legislate based on Rogue boards or the
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
tiny minority of boards that are doing
 
04:15:09.429 --> 04:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
the wrong thing as things currently
 
04:15:11.710 --> 04:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
stand boards are supposed to have open
 
04:15:13.750 --> 04:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
meetings one at least once per quarter
 
04:15:15.990 --> 04:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
if they're meeting there must be an open
 
04:15:18.550 --> 04:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
session and meeting uh minutes must be
 
04:15:20.429 --> 04:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
taken they're supposed to be produced
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of the meeting or within
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
15 days of being
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
produced the people that introduce this
 
04:15:30.429 --> 04:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
uh legislation have a terrible board or
 
04:15:32.269 --> 04:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
based on their
 
04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
testimony their board does not produce
 
04:15:37.229 --> 04:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
minutes even though the law requires
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
them to produce minutes so I don't think
 
04:15:42.910 --> 04:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
yet another law produce requiring boards
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
to produce uh meeting minutes and
 
04:15:47.550 --> 04:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
promptly give it to the owners will
 
04:15:50.429 --> 04:15:50.439 align:start position:0%
change anything for their board you
 
04:15:53.229 --> 04:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
can't make you can't micromanage condos
 
04:15:55.990 --> 04:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's a slew of litigation that has
 
04:15:58.229 --> 04:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
come out over the last eight years that
 
04:16:00.269 --> 04:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
is micromanage condos and this is yet
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
another attempt to do so and it is
 
04:16:04.950 --> 04:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible to find volunteers
 
04:16:07.229 --> 04:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
to fill these slots when you have a Road
 
04:16:09.790 --> 04:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
board Rogue board you have the power of
 
04:16:12.269 --> 04:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
the ballot to remove them you have the
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
the power of the removal process to
 
04:16:15.950 --> 04:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
remove them so you don't even have to
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
wait for the election you can call a
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
special meeting and remove a rogue board
 
04:16:23.349 --> 04:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
but please do not legislate based on the
 
04:16:25.870 --> 04:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
tiny minority of bad boards because most
 
04:16:28.590 --> 04:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
boards are good they're composed of
 
04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
people who have ninet to-5 jobs or or
 
04:16:33.149 --> 04:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
just a day job is what I'm trying to say
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
not a 9 to-5 job a a day job and then
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
they pour their heart and soul into
 
04:16:40.349 --> 04:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
their condo for no money um we don't
 
04:16:42.990 --> 04:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
need more legislation uh affecting them
 
04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll close and take any
 
04:16:46.750 --> 04:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay so I'm going to ask you
 
04:16:48.790 --> 04:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
this question because it's going to be
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
uh with bills coming up are still going
 
04:16:54.109 --> 04:16:54.119 align:start position:0%
to fall forward so clearly the statute
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
requires them the minutes supposed to be
 
04:16:59.950 --> 04:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
printed after 60 days if a board did not
 
04:16:59.960 --> 04:17:01.269 align:start position:0%
printed after 60 days if a board did not
do

04:17:01.269 --> 04:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:17:06.590 --> 04:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
that a condo owner should do what to get
 
04:17:09.189 --> 04:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
those minutes I think you could file a
 
04:17:13.309 --> 04:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and in the it would be like a be
 
04:17:15.790 --> 04:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
a breach of fiduciary duty or just a
 
04:17:18.550 --> 04:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
violation of the condo statute and and
 
04:17:20.910 --> 04:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
require get a a judge to issue an order
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
requiring the board to produce minutes
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
for all of the meetings uh and then to
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
follow the statute going forward and you
 
04:17:28.630 --> 04:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
could get your legal fees for that if
 
04:17:28.640 --> 04:17:29.590 align:start position:0%
could get your legal fees for that if
you

04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:17:29.600 --> 04:17:32.070 align:start position:0%
you
won

04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
won
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the committee uh
 
04:17:36.910 --> 04:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative MCU had his hand up first
 
04:17:40.510 --> 04:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
and then you can represent
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
Herbert how do I put this delicately
 
04:17:44.710 --> 04:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
isn't it a bit
 
04:17:47.550 --> 04:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
ridiculous to ask members that own
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
property there to file a lawsuit to get
 
04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
minutes from a
 
04:17:55.389 --> 04:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
meeting of folks who essentially are
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
elected by them and work for them and
 
04:18:00.109 --> 04:18:00.119 align:start position:0%
potentially have to expend legal fees
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
and potentially have to pay their
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
adversaries legal fees I mean what what
 
04:18:06.309 --> 04:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
are these boards hiding that or they
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
want to delay release of why can't they
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
just post the minutes oh I I I couldn't
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
agree more I think it's absurd and I
 
04:18:13.070 --> 04:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
would never advise a client not to
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
produce minutes I think the reason we're
 
04:18:18.389 --> 04:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
here is because someone wants another
 
04:18:20.349 --> 04:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
law requiring minutes to be produced
 
04:18:22.429 --> 04:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
well that law already exists and the
 
04:18:24.830 --> 04:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
timing is 60 days this one says promptly
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
so there's a bit of a change there but I
 
04:18:27.710 --> 04:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
agree with you boards should be
 
04:18:29.070 --> 04:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
producing minutes they should make them
 
04:18:31.710 --> 04:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
available nothing should be hidden
 
04:18:35.229 --> 04:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
nothing follow up for the question Meir
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
is are there points where 60
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
days is too long because those minutes
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
contain something that maybe is
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
objectionable or they want to take
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
action of and would you would you
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
support making it you know 10 working
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
days or something like that I personally
 
04:18:54.670 --> 04:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
would support 30 days I think 10 is
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
difficult um you working days 10 working
 
04:19:01.149 --> 04:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
days so it's two two business weeks
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
longer if there's a holiday in there
 
04:19:04.109 --> 04:19:04.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere I suppose I wouldn't lose
 
04:19:06.750 --> 04:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
sleep over it but I I I I I speak for my
 
04:19:08.590 --> 04:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
myself only I think 30 days would be
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable because it's you know people
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
have lives um and they can't always just
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
go home and and produce this stuff uh
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
after working their job going to their
 
04:19:19.590 --> 04:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
condo meeting and maybe they have to
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
take care of children or uh a parent so
 
04:19:26.750 --> 04:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
let's not ask too much of our volunteers
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh in these positions could I live with
 
04:19:32.229 --> 04:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
30 days me personally yes I could so not
 
04:19:35.109 --> 04:19:35.119 align:start position:0%
withstanding you this is going to lead
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
on to representative Aly be we you know
 
04:19:38.910 --> 04:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
we have some other
 
04:19:41.550 --> 04:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
bills the issue
 
04:19:46.030 --> 04:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
is not 30 days 60 days 10 days if a
 
04:19:48.510 --> 04:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
board doesn't issue the
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
minutes period they don't issue the
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
minutes and that that there how do you
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
compel a volunteer
 
04:20:01.070 --> 04:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
board to you know do their
 
04:20:05.189 --> 04:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
job and you obviously your response was
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
well you have you got to go find a
 
04:20:11.070 --> 04:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer and sue them okay um and
 
04:20:12.750 --> 04:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
represent Alby thinks that we can they
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
can come to a committee and maybe they
 
04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
can uh the committee will browbeat that
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
board to get those minutes out of that
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
out of that board but maybe not so the
 
04:20:28.349 --> 04:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
Ed resolution is that is the same as
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
electing those boards that the only
 
04:20:32.910 --> 04:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
resolution this this is my question for
 
04:20:35.710 --> 04:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
you is it not the only real resolution
 
04:20:37.710 --> 04:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
is that now you've got to then find
 
04:20:41.349 --> 04:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
2third of the condo owners to vote to
 
04:20:42.750 --> 04:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
have a special meeting and throw the
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
board out because they won't issue their
 
04:20:46.469 --> 04:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
minutes well you might not need that
 
04:20:48.349 --> 04:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
many but I mean I think in all walks of
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
life there are issues that you confront
 
04:20:51.750 --> 04:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
where a lawsuit's your only option and
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
listen I am not a litigator I don't like
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
to file lawsuits over over silly things
 
04:20:58.349 --> 04:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
but if you if you go to get your car
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
fixed and they do a lousy job you can go
 
04:21:02.349 --> 04:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
back and say listen you screwed up my
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
car you've got to fix it and maybe they
 
04:21:06.149 --> 04:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
do and maybe they don't and if they
 
04:21:06.159 --> 04:21:07.109 align:start position:0%
do and maybe they don't and if they
don't

04:21:07.109 --> 04:21:07.119 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
you don't need a a law on the books to
 
04:21:11.910 --> 04:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
have we do have one but what I mean we
 
04:21:13.950 --> 04:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
have the consumer protection act well I
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes but you still have to invoke those
 
04:21:17.830 --> 04:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
rights don't you have to go to court the
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act is you can go to
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
court and you get Triple damages yeah uh
 
04:21:24.189 --> 04:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
but we actually have an attorney general
 
04:21:26.269 --> 04:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
whose responsibility would be to take
 
04:21:28.349 --> 04:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
that call and usually the Attorney
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
General will then call the the auto
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
repair well condo owners can go to the
 
04:21:34.389 --> 04:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
attorney general as well what I'm saying
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know the car was just one example
 
04:21:38.710 --> 04:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
call anything you get a you go to the
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
the takeout uh restaurant you get the
 
04:21:44.590 --> 04:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
wrong order about that the problem is
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
that all the Attorney General's office
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
or all the consumer protection act is
 
04:21:50.109 --> 04:21:50.119 align:start position:0%
really intended to do is to make you
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
whole get your money back but in this
 
04:21:57.149 --> 04:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
case these are minutes and the board
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to print them and print
 
04:22:00.429 --> 04:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
board does whatever excuse they don't
 
04:22:01.790 --> 04:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
why they don't do
 
04:22:04.830 --> 04:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
it how how there's no how how's it
 
04:22:07.149 --> 04:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
attorney general going to how and force
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know them to produce them I presume
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
if enough owners cared they could just
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
elect a new board who will do the right
 
04:22:16.469 --> 04:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
thing and again we're not talking about
 
04:22:18.070 --> 04:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of boards we're not talking
 
04:22:20.750 --> 04:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
about even a large minority we're
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
talking about a tiny minority in my
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
opinion corre got that okay thank you
 
04:22:30.070 --> 04:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you all right that was Dean great
 
04:22:33.070 --> 04:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm going reverse order so Paul
 
04:22:34.910 --> 04:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're in the middle
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
now so used to have years ago remember Z
 
04:22:42.109 --> 04:22:42.119 align:start position:0%
maybe it was can there was a there was
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
an association for condo
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
owners was it was it wasn't it called
 
04:22:52.229 --> 04:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
Can Am I am I dreaming this up that was
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
even before your time are we in a
 
04:22:56.910 --> 04:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
different building yeah okay go ahead
 
04:23:00.030 --> 04:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
all right Paul okak
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
again same
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
people the the concern with this is
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
questions question I know you said not
 
04:23:09.630 --> 04:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
to repeat anything but put different
 
04:23:12.309 --> 04:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
perspectives is I I can tell you this
 
04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
that volunteer board members are
 
04:23:17.309 --> 04:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
declining there are boards supposed to
 
04:23:19.389 --> 04:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
have five we're lucky if we have three
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's boards that are supposed to have
 
04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
seven members we're lucky if we have
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
four um the the pressure on the legisl
 
04:23:28.349 --> 04:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
legislature and and laws that are coming
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
in to put pressure on boards and out
 
04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
with their families or whatnot they're
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
starting to retract from being
 
04:23:39.070 --> 04:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers it's a problem in our
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
industry to go to monthly board meetings
 
04:23:45.109 --> 04:23:45.119 align:start position:0%
is is a little daunting because you have
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
condos out there anywhere from five
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
units to 498 units in New Hampshire and
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
to require board member
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
volunteers uh to attend a monthly
 
04:23:57.510 --> 04:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
meeting for things that just kind of
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
normally run and when most condos are
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
run well uh they put in the contracts
 
04:24:05.229 --> 04:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
for a landscape and snow and a painting
 
04:24:06.910 --> 04:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
cycle and a roofing cycle and things
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
just kind of flow and once boards make
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
those executive decisions they're
 
04:24:13.550 --> 04:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
implemented and things go fine uh the
 
04:24:15.510 --> 04:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
other thing with this is if if you if
 
04:24:17.790 --> 04:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
you implement or or care to implement 12
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
meetings a year many management
 
04:24:22.389 --> 04:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
agreements with their client boards
 
04:24:25.109 --> 04:24:25.119 align:start position:0%
are they specify because time is the
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
commodity of the management company uh
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
they specify how many meetings the
 
04:24:31.630 --> 04:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
management will attend or how many board
 
04:24:34.349 --> 04:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
meetings there are so if you have a
 
04:24:36.750 --> 04:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
management company that has a a a client
 
04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
that they are to meet with four times a
 
04:24:40.750 --> 04:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
year and you go to 12 that's going to
 
04:24:42.429 --> 04:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
adjust the management fee which
 
04:24:44.710 --> 04:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately puts the fee burden on to the
 
04:24:46.750 --> 04:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
unit owners
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
so back to what everybody says the
 
04:24:51.149 --> 04:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
processes and the laws are already in
 
04:24:54.750 --> 04:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
place to do a broad brush approach and
 
04:24:59.950 --> 04:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
legislate our industry for a Association
 
04:25:02.590 --> 04:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
or an association or two that may not be
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
following it uh my suggestion would be
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
for that assoc or a few unit owners we
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
have a Trade Organization Community
 
04:25:09.600 --> 04:25:10.790 align:start position:0%
have a Trade Organization Community
Association

04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
Association
 
04:25:13.389 --> 04:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
Institute is that to contact them and
 
04:25:15.710 --> 04:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
see if there's any attorneys or what
 
04:25:18.910 --> 04:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the Trade Organization for our our
 
04:25:21.950 --> 04:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
industry can do to help that situation
 
04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh so there are other means to maybe
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
help help folks like this so this is
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
very daunting to put on to associations
 
04:25:32.429 --> 04:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
that really don't need
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
it any
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.469 --> 04:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
chair I'm not sure if this is uh an
 
04:25:46.269 --> 04:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate question for you no go ahead
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
U thank you for your testimony uh
 
04:25:50.030 --> 04:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
there's an existing statute that
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
requires boards to to take minutes and
 
04:25:56.830 --> 04:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
release the minutes um that that seems
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
to be already it's uh 356b
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
37 um I I won't read all the details but
 
04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're required to take them release
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
them within a certain time frame and
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
then keep them available for a number of
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
years right
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
um is is that is that section of this
 
04:26:18.910 --> 04:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill redundant with current statute and
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
then if so are we just talking about
 
04:26:23.070 --> 04:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
monthly versus quarterly is
 
04:26:25.710 --> 04:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
that the Crux of it the the minutes are
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
be to to be distributed and and if I may
 
04:26:30.630 --> 04:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
regress for a moment on the time frame
 
04:26:33.109 --> 04:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
of minutes minutes are to be approved at
 
04:26:35.309 --> 04:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
the next board meeting so if boards meet
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
every other month mon then they can't be
 
04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
approved within 30 days uh what minutes
 
04:26:42.910 --> 04:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
can be done is maybe distributed to the
 
04:26:45.229 --> 04:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
public as a draft and the board approve
 
04:26:46.750 --> 04:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
them or a board maybe approve them
 
04:26:48.510 --> 04:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
through some emails so we can get them
 
04:26:52.189 --> 04:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
out to out to the the populace but board
 
04:26:55.149 --> 04:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
minutes are done within 30 days a 10 day
 
04:26:57.349 --> 04:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
back to Dean's point you have folks we
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
we can't even get board members to
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
respond to emails half the time but back
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
to this is if your question is this this
 
04:27:09.109 --> 04:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
is going from quarterly to every month
 
04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
and that's that's that's huge that is
 
04:27:15.269 --> 04:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
huge and if if minutes are not
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
distributed then there's an issue a a
 
04:27:21.469 --> 04:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
micro issue not a macro issue and that
 
04:27:24.750 --> 04:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
should be addressed on the micro
 
04:27:27.109 --> 04:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
level okay representative
 
04:27:27.119 --> 04:27:29.389 align:start position:0%
level okay representative
Herbert

04:27:29.389 --> 04:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
Herbert
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
um um I think it would be a fair
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
statement to say that we need uh we need
 
04:27:37.070 --> 04:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
to enforce the law
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
I I I'm I'm a little
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
um concerned about the fact that um you
 
04:27:45.229 --> 04:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
have an man you have a professional
 
04:27:47.309 --> 04:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
management company apparently that's got
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
a contract you have board members
 
04:27:53.309 --> 04:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
apparently and then you have nothing's
 
04:27:55.990 --> 04:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
being done and there the law is being
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
broken and and apparently the civilians
 
04:28:02.510 --> 04:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
the homeowners it's up to them to file a
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuit in order to get the law enforced
 
04:28:09.790 --> 04:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
and to me that that's backwards and so I
 
04:28:11.870 --> 04:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
think the problem I see is that the
 
04:28:15.189 --> 04:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
state doesn't have the uh uh
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or the people to enforce
 
04:28:22.670 --> 04:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
the law and and that disturbs me and uh
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
if uh because a lot of this stuff is
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
somebody's being
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
incompetent there's there's incompetence
 
04:28:33.070 --> 04:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
here and that is not being
 
04:28:36.630 --> 04:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
punished and we somebody should go in
 
04:28:40.349 --> 04:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
take the uh uh um the people that are
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
not doing their job and are being paid
 
04:28:45.269 --> 04:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
for it and saying you're out of here I'm
 
04:28:47.469 --> 04:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
going to put somebody else in here who
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
does a really good job and but only
 
04:28:54.510 --> 04:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
somebody like the AG can do that kind of
 
04:28:59.550 --> 04:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
thing and so uh these folks are out and
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
left to drrive they don't have the
 
04:29:06.149 --> 04:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
ability or the money to change anything
 
04:29:07.750 --> 04:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
you can't get a
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
734 2/3 vote 34 vote to get anything
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
done there's only one thing that can
 
04:29:17.950 --> 04:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
happen that will actually get something
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
done and you put a cop on the
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
beat the log's being broken it's not
 
04:29:24.000 --> 04:29:24.790 align:start position:0%
beat the log's being broken it's not
being

04:29:24.790 --> 04:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:29:28.830 --> 04:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
enforced end of story that is correct
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
but the the the good thing about this is
 
04:29:33.710 --> 04:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
there are safety nets in place that can
 
04:29:36.750 --> 04:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
if an enacted can take care of those
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
situations such as call for a special
 
04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
meeting um I I I would have difficulty
 
04:29:44.429 --> 04:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
understand or believing that just a few
 
04:29:45.950 --> 04:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
members of an association with an
 
04:29:48.429 --> 04:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
assessment like this or whatever are
 
04:29:50.590 --> 04:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
just saying we the ones being wrong that
 
04:29:52.870 --> 04:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
there aren't more involved I've again
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
been in this business I've seen boards
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
overthrown I've seen all kind of
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
different stories make your hair curl
 
04:30:01.309 --> 04:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
but the processes were followed and when
 
04:30:03.910 --> 04:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
the processes are followed it works it
 
04:30:07.149 --> 04:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
works beautifully so processes are there
 
04:30:10.510 --> 04:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
it's all in 356b of of board board how
 
04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
to overthrow a board how to call a
 
04:30:14.429 --> 04:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
special meeting how to remove a board
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
member elections the it's the process
 
04:30:19.229 --> 04:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
look at our well look at the Iowa
 
04:30:21.750 --> 04:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
caucuses last night I mean that's kind
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
of how our democracy
 
04:30:23.439 --> 04:30:26.030 align:start position:0%
of how our democracy
works

04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
works
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
jez okay I didn't say it was right or
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
wrong okay but that's the process so do
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know a lawyer that that represents
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
unit owners have you have you ever met a
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
laer a lawyer who actually represent
 
04:30:41.870 --> 04:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
unit owners I I don't know of any uh H
 
04:30:43.469 --> 04:30:43.479 align:start position:0%
that's the problem we need you know we
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
no we don't have anybody who does that I
 
04:30:48.389 --> 04:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
just I've been just Googling it here and
 
04:30:50.710 --> 04:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
and I find a lot of fine law firms who
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
are really willing to help the condo
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
association but nothing nobody wants to
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
be there for the unit owner I I disagree
 
04:30:57.910 --> 04:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
with that again I think well you
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
disagree tell me would you find one for
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
me so when we have our subcommittee can
 
04:31:04.030 --> 04:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
you come in with a couple of of lawyers
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
who would be willing to help these these
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
folks out just get their minutes I I
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
think that again our Trade Organization
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
when they hear that our industry is
 
04:31:14.189 --> 04:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
being wronged will certainly have
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
somebody that will step well I got three
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
of you right here so the three of you
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to find some lawyer for me
 
04:31:22.750 --> 04:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
right somebody either that how about you
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
make the phone call to that condo and
 
04:31:30.070 --> 04:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
tell them to just give them their damage
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
exactly well okay thank you thank you
 
04:31:35.710 --> 04:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
all right Gary Mr chairman Mr Mr
 
04:31:37.109 --> 04:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I one more question for that
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
witness if he'll take it how about Gary
 
04:31:42.109 --> 04:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
he's he's no it's for this gentleman all
 
04:31:44.830 --> 04:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
back thank you thank you for taking the
 
04:31:47.950 --> 04:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
question I think you mentioned you were
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
from marac would you actually because
 
04:31:51.309 --> 04:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
you probably know some of the players
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
involved here I'm guessing and I don't
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
actually aside from the constituents
 
04:31:58.349 --> 04:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
behind you and a fellow representative
 
04:31:59.950 --> 04:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
would you make that phone call if you
 
04:32:01.750 --> 04:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
happen to know him just because it would
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
probably save a lot of people a lot of
 
04:32:05.950 --> 04:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
time and there's three or four of you
 
04:32:08.469 --> 04:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
here who have an interest in this and
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
four of you at least that can stop
 
04:32:12.510 --> 04:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
showing up and get these folks what they
 
04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
need I'm not an attorney but I play one
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
on TV so right um I can't come from a
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
legal perspective I can come from a
 
04:32:22.990 --> 04:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
management company perspective we'll get
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
Gary up here I'll have to I'll have to
 
04:32:26.349 --> 04:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
buy Gary lunch and see what we can do or
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:34.439 --> 04:32:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
Gary

04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
I mean all these years you don't know a
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
single lawyer who has ever pursued a
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
case so uh I was going to start there
 
04:32:54.030 --> 04:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
actually um I apologize because I'm
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
horrible with names in general and I'm
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
not coming up with any off the top of my
 
04:33:01.469 --> 04:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
head as I sit here but I can guarantee
 
04:33:03.550 --> 04:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
you that these people exist they're
 
04:33:06.029 --> 04:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
maybe not as easy to find as those of us
 
04:33:09.789 --> 04:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
who do this sort of thing publicly for
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
associations but they exist the proof of
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is that when I go to court they're
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
whoever's on the other side oh um all
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
you have to do is look at some previous
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
cases and you know who the attorney
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
represented yes if if I was at my office
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
give a couple of these then yes if I was
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
at my office looking at papers um I can
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
tell you that there are those attorneys
 
04:33:33.429 --> 04:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
who will represent unit owners because
 
04:33:35.150 --> 04:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
they show up in court and they're on the
 
04:33:37.349 --> 04:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
other side I've dealt with them so I
 
04:33:39.310 --> 04:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
know that all I'm asking from you is
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
when we have the subcommittee you give
 
04:33:44.230 --> 04:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
me three New Hampshire lawyers and and
 
04:33:48.750 --> 04:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
you'll make my day okay I will make a
 
04:33:50.830 --> 04:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
note because that's going to solve all
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
these bills if we just
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
had lawyers who would represent people
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
okay uh fair enough um also I think what
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
what might help on these bills is the
 
04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
fact that I previously referred to
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
myself as the spoiler because I keep
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
telling you what already exists um but
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
spoiler probably has a negative
 
04:34:15.109 --> 04:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
connotation and and maybe it's good news
 
04:34:16.510 --> 04:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
um maybe I should be telling you that
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
the good news is that because of the
 
04:34:22.470 --> 04:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
regulations and law that exist you don't
 
04:34:25.390 --> 04:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily need more um I won't beat a
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
dead horse you've already heard that the
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
law already requires both meeting
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
minutes and
 
04:34:34.510 --> 04:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
financials um but what I would like to
 
04:34:36.390 --> 04:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
do is draw your attention just to to
 
04:34:43.109 --> 04:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
where it is briefly it's at 37e 37- e of
 
04:34:46.269 --> 04:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
356b which is the the Condominium
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
Act and um again just so everybody's on
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
the same page it it doesn't say at
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
present 30 days or 60 days it says
 
04:35:00.269 --> 04:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
within 15 days of a unit owner's request
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
at present um that's what it says the 60
 
04:35:05.670 --> 04:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
days comes from the fact that the board
 
04:35:08.750 --> 04:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
has that long on the outer end to
 
04:35:11.629 --> 04:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
approve meeting minutes um but what the
 
04:35:16.390 --> 04:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
law already says is the 60 days um from
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
the time of the meeting or 15 days from
 
04:35:24.029 --> 04:35:24.039 align:start position:0%
the time of unit owner requests them um
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
so we actually already not only have
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
this covered by existing law but it's
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
covered in more specific detail uh the
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
bill that we're looking at says meeting
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
minutes uh you know be uh produced
 
04:35:38.470 --> 04:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
promptly and uh as we all know speaking
 
04:35:41.230 --> 04:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
of attorneys um you know if we had a
 
04:35:43.150 --> 04:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
couple in the room we could argue about
 
04:35:45.230 --> 04:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not today's Tuesday that's
 
04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
just sort of how it goes so there will
 
04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
certainly be arguments about what it
 
04:35:51.629 --> 04:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
means for meeting minutes to be
 
04:35:55.510 --> 04:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
delivered promptly uh but in 37e you
 
04:35:57.990 --> 04:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
already have an objective standard that
 
04:36:00.910 --> 04:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
exists uh with the 15 days and the 60
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
days so I I would say that um you know
 
04:36:06.310 --> 04:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
you've got that
 
04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
covered I also just want to address very
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
briefly the notion of the Rogue bad
 
04:36:14.429 --> 04:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
board members that exist and the
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
community possibly getting rid of those
 
04:36:18.990 --> 04:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
board members um there's been a lot of
 
04:36:22.349 --> 04:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
talk of the 2third standard and uh
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's understandable because the 2third
 
04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
standards applies in a lot of different
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
areas but with respect to removal of a
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
board member this is at section
 
04:36:37.510 --> 04:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
40-b of of the existing statute and it
 
04:36:40.269 --> 04:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
says that a um member of the board of
 
04:36:43.310 --> 04:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
directors may be removed with or without
 
04:36:46.189 --> 04:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
cause if the number of votes cast in
 
04:36:49.150 --> 04:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
favor of removal exceeds the number of
 
04:36:52.390 --> 04:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
votes cast in opposition to removal and
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
in plain English that's just a simple
 
04:36:57.629 --> 04:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
majority standard so if an association
 
04:36:59.551 --> 04:36:59.561 align:start position:0%
where the community feels that one or
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
more board members is Rogue and and
 
04:37:04.269 --> 04:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
they're bad and they need to be removed
 
04:37:05.789 --> 04:37:05.799 align:start position:0%
has a me
 
04:37:07.629 --> 04:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
uh and they seek to remove this board
 
04:37:09.990 --> 04:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
member the existing law at
 
04:37:13.230 --> 04:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
40b uh puts forth just a simple majority
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
standard for that so that is not a a
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the community issue and a
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
and a rogue board member can be
 
04:37:23.310 --> 04:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
dismissed um lastly with respect to the
 
04:37:27.070 --> 04:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
notion of uh associations being required
 
04:37:31.150 --> 04:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
now to meet on a monthly basis um it
 
04:37:34.189 --> 04:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
it's a lot you heard that from Paul
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
who's a property manager who's in the
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
industry who knows what's involved uh
 
04:37:41.470 --> 04:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
with these meetings um and I'll only add
 
04:37:43.310 --> 04:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
to that by giving a a practical
 
04:37:45.670 --> 04:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
consideration that there are a lot of
 
04:37:47.789 --> 04:37:47.799 align:start position:0%
associations in New Hampshire that are
 
04:37:50.349 --> 04:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
what you might call Summer associations
 
04:37:52.269 --> 04:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
they're up at the lake and it's where
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
people go for fun in the summer they're
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
not around right now to have these
 
04:37:59.949 --> 04:37:59.959 align:start position:0%
meetings conversely New Hampshire has a
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
number significant number of
 
04:38:03.310 --> 04:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
condominiums that are what you might
 
04:38:06.189 --> 04:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
call Winter Condominiums they're up at
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
the mountains where everybody goes to
 
04:38:10.109 --> 04:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
ski and those folks are not around up
 
04:38:14.429 --> 04:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
there in the summer so monthly meetings
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
I I I would suggest are not suitable for
 
04:38:19.150 --> 04:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
everyone um someone made a comment
 
04:38:22.150 --> 04:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
earlier about is this a on siiz fits-all
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
issue uh probably not I I think what you
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
should do is leave two associations uh
 
04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
to determine what meetings they need at
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
their Association if you have a year
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
round they might might decide they want
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings and if so there's
 
04:38:39.629 --> 04:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
nothing stopping that um but again
 
04:38:41.070 --> 04:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
you've got your summer places you've got
 
04:38:43.230 --> 04:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
your winter places so really when it
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
comes to how many times and when the
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
board meets I think you really need to
 
04:38:50.629 --> 04:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
you know rely on the individual boards
 
04:38:52.670 --> 04:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
at their individual associations to
 
04:38:55.470 --> 04:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
decide when they need meetings and and
 
04:38:58.510 --> 04:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
when is a good time to have
 
04:39:01.230 --> 04:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
them that's all I have happy to answer
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
questions if there are great just help
 
04:39:05.949 --> 04:39:05.959 align:start position:0%
me out when we do our committe uh yes I
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
made a note and then I don't I made a
 
04:39:10.029 --> 04:39:10.039 align:start position:0%
note my adversaries will be thrilled uh
 
04:39:12.070 --> 04:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
that Peter Flynn securing why I know
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
that name Flynn Peter Flyn construction
 
04:39:15.709 --> 04:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
no no this is a
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
lawyer I just pulled him up he but like
 
04:39:21.070 --> 04:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
my Google but I used to have a someone
 
04:39:22.830 --> 04:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
used to do consumer protection statute
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
but oh I see oh I'm sorry one last Quick
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
Point uh to address a question that was
 
04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
just sort of floating um the reason why
 
04:39:33.990 --> 04:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
we as attorneys can't necessarily call a
 
04:39:39.150 --> 04:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
rogue board um and say Hey you calling C
 
04:39:42.190 --> 04:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
you would be calling as CIA saying
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
listen you know can you guys find your
 
04:39:46.990 --> 04:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
way to and I'm sure they'll have lots of
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
stories to tell you about these two
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
lovely ladies here and but but then you
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
say I don't care all I know is the
 
04:39:55.470 --> 04:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee really wants
 
04:40:00.670 --> 04:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
me to urge you to just so yes there are
 
04:40:02.628 --> 04:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
within the Trade Organization there are
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
folks uh I believe that might be able to
 
04:40:07.150 --> 04:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
do that um for those of us that are
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys I just want to mention that
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
the um rules of professional conduct for
 
04:40:15.628 --> 04:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
attorneys prohibit us from interacting
 
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
directly with someone else's client
 
04:40:20.430 --> 04:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
correct um so that's why I couldn't just
 
04:40:22.830 --> 04:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
callate but he said he wasn't a lawyer
 
04:40:25.390 --> 04:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
so right right one of you guys can make
 
04:40:27.030 --> 04:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
that phone call for yes within the Trade
 
04:40:28.510 --> 04:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
Organization I believe there are people
 
04:40:30.750 --> 04:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
appreci um I just wanted for the record
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
to say that the reason why those of us
 
04:40:33.990 --> 04:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
that are attorneys can't just call
 
04:40:35.868 --> 04:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
anybody is because we're not allowed to
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
call other people's clients thank you
 
04:40:40.910 --> 04:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
very much thank you oh did we take one
 
04:40:43.230 --> 04:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
question yes repres Amon has a
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:40:47.230 --> 04:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
um I I followed your references to the
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
15-day requirement to release financials
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the minutes my only question is what
 
04:40:58.510 --> 04:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
happens if they don't what's the the
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
recourse um so oh actually thank you for
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
this question I meant to mention that
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
and I I failed to do so um one form of
 
04:41:09.990 --> 04:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
recourse we've talked about is removal
 
04:41:12.270 --> 04:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
of board members and and like I just
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
said the standard is not 2third it's a
 
04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's a majority uh when that meeting
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
happens um another form of recourse
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
which you've already heard is to go to
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
court um but to sort of temper that
 
04:41:29.470 --> 04:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
response I will say that again existing
 
04:41:32.350 --> 04:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
law in the New Hampshire Condominium Act
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is at uh section 15
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 states that the
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
prevailing party recovers their legal
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
fees and costs and so you know to the
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
extent that the idea is or that the
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
general notion is that well unit owners
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
can't afford the legal process and so
 
04:41:51.670 --> 04:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
they're shut out and they can't be
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
required to do that um if you've got
 
04:41:57.030 --> 04:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
folks that have such a good case that
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're about to be able to demonstrate
 
04:42:02.270 --> 04:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
that there haven't been proper meetings
 
04:42:03.670 --> 04:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
that there hasn't been maintenance done
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
for 10 years that they don't have any
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes for whatever span of
 
04:42:10.990 --> 04:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
time that exceeds the statute if folks
 
04:42:13.868 --> 04:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
are prepared to demonstrate that um even
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
setting aside that that people do have
 
04:42:18.030 --> 04:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
the option to represent themselves and I
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
see plenty of that as well um in court
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
and and judges are very open to
 
04:42:24.788 --> 04:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
listening to people speak about their
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
own issues um but even if they get an
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
attorney if they demonstrate that sort
 
04:42:32.110 --> 04:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
of case hey hands down my board is
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
breaking the law it says they have to do
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
minutes they're just not doing them then
 
04:42:40.030 --> 04:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
under section 15 Roman numeral 2 they
 
04:42:42.350 --> 04:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
will be able to recover uh those legal
 
04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:47.120 --> 04:42:49.708 align:start position:0%
 
now

04:42:49.708 --> 04:42:49.718 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thanks all right moving
 
04:42:52.958 --> 04:42:54.708 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thanks all right moving
right

04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%

04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
along what's the next
 
04:42:58.160 --> 04:43:00.470 align:start position:0%
along what's the next
11:29

04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
11:29
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
yep I didn't I was up there I didn't
 
04:43:06.628 --> 04:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay well that's true I didn't hit the
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
gavel so hurry up come on
 
04:43:14.270 --> 04:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
up yeah thank you very much sir no
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
problem all right so really quick
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
volunteers yes and I was one but oh
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
sorry Katie porier mayor M New Hampshire
 
04:43:29.430 --> 04:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
um so volunteers yes that is what you
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
signed up for that is what everybody
 
04:43:34.750 --> 04:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
signs up for being a volunteer um one
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
size fits-all no like they said seasonal
 
04:43:41.230 --> 04:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
I get it but they also have the
 
04:43:44.550 --> 04:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity of meeting by Zoom so they
 
04:43:46.670 --> 04:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to necessarily go in but
 
04:43:50.430 --> 04:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
people could still go and watch and it
 
04:43:52.310 --> 04:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
could just be a 10-minute meeting hey
 
04:43:54.750 --> 04:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
this is a followup or this is an update
 
04:43:56.350 --> 04:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
cool moving
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
along um
 
04:44:03.788 --> 04:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
so that fits that um I like the bill I
 
04:44:05.948 --> 04:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
think the Bill's great
 
04:44:08.310 --> 04:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
because what you're doing if you're not
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
allowing a quarterly is you're
 
04:44:13.270 --> 04:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
restricting your unit owners your
 
04:44:16.948 --> 04:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
homeowners that want to be educated want
 
04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
to know what is going on within my
 
04:44:20.400 --> 04:44:21.628 align:start position:0%
to know what is going on within my
property

04:44:21.628 --> 04:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:44:25.030 --> 04:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
investment right I am investing in this
 
04:44:27.670 --> 04:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
common area so if there's trees being
 
04:44:31.310 --> 04:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
cut down bu my you know bu my unit I'd
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
like to know but I wouldn't know for
 
04:44:34.650 --> 04:44:34.660 align:start position:0%
three months
 
04:44:34.660 --> 04:44:36.550 align:start position:0%
three months
[Music]

04:44:36.550 --> 04:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:44:40.110 --> 04:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
um see so not going to go about the
 
04:44:43.990 --> 04:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
whole Road board thing but Town meetings
 
04:44:47.628 --> 04:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
and stuff I don't necessarily go all the
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
time but I do watch them because again I
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
want to be
 
04:44:52.080 --> 04:44:54.190 align:start position:0%
want to be
educated

04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
educated
 
04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
um and something about the car repair
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
and it you know following up if it's
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
still out a quarterly I would have to
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
wait three months or watch what's
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
happening in my community to get an
 
04:45:11.788 --> 04:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
update I wouldn't be able just to call
 
04:45:13.470 --> 04:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
because when I call management they're
 
04:45:15.788 --> 04:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
like oh I'll have to talk to the board
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
about that and the board's not meeting
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
for another three months so I'm in limbo
 
04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
for three
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
months so that there's a lot of talk
 
04:45:29.550 --> 04:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
about meeting minutes wasn't really
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to redirect that you know
 
04:45:34.350 --> 04:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
meetings itself are important as well
 
04:45:39.190 --> 04:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
well so thank you oh sorry any
 
04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions okay I think we're all set
 
04:45:46.990 --> 04:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.350 --> 04:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
hearing all right represent Aly
 
04:45:54.430 --> 04:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
1129 and I'm happy to say that I have
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.910 --> 04:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill don't say anything that changes it
 
04:46:03.920 --> 04:46:04.868 align:start position:0%
bill don't say anything that changes it
please

04:46:04.868 --> 04:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
well the first thing that I want to do
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
is to distribute a
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
small on relevant
 
04:46:20.670 --> 04:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay which was handed to me by
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:26.080 --> 04:46:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
legislature

04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:32.270 --> 04:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
co-conspirator which we received his
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
testimony emailed
 
04:46:42.190 --> 04:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:45.110 --> 04:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
email yeah you can just pass them around
 
04:46:47.548 --> 04:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
don't worry just keep
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
going we got a snowstorm out there
 
04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
and we all want to get home before it
 
04:46:54.718 --> 04:46:56.670 align:start position:0%
and we all want to get home before it
gets

04:46:56.670 --> 04:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
gets
 
04:46:59.590 --> 04:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
dark you don't know
 
04:46:59.600 --> 04:47:01.708 align:start position:0%
dark you don't know
okay

04:47:01.708 --> 04:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:47:04.830 --> 04:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:47:04.840 --> 04:47:05.788 align:start position:0%
uh so
this

04:47:05.788 --> 04:47:05.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is a lot narrower than
 
04:47:11.230 --> 04:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
the following bill and I will have my
 
04:47:14.230 --> 04:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
say about governance at that point but
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
this is specifically about
 
04:47:19.270 --> 04:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
proxies from a gentleman who has a lot
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
to say about governance and he it's up
 
04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
to you whether he includes it there or
 
04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
he stays and he includes it later um but
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:37.230 --> 04:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
condominium has decided that since when
 
04:47:43.150 --> 04:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.990 --> 04:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
say that
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
um a undirected proxy cannot be uh cast
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
by a person holding more than 10% of the
 
04:48:02.070 --> 04:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
votes we neglected to ad to Define
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
proxy and directed proxy and undirected
 
04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
proxy so they have decided that there is
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
only one kind of proxy it is a directed
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
Pro undirected proxy in which case um a
 
04:48:22.230 --> 04:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
large part of his condominium uh is
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
people who live out of state and are are
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
here for weekends and things
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
occasionally and um the board sends them
 
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
the proxies the
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
directed uh undirected proxies that say
 
04:48:43.750 --> 04:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
that the board has the right to vote
 
04:48:47.430 --> 04:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
your proxy however it
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
wants and um he's been in quite a long
 
04:48:54.990 --> 04:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
fight uh about this so I'm going to
 
04:48:57.628 --> 04:48:57.638 align:start position:0%
leave him to tell that Tale But what
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it defines
 
04:49:04.750 --> 04:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
proxy I checked in on the internet in
 
04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
legal sections for that uh it defines a
 
04:49:09.680 --> 04:49:11.390 align:start position:0%
legal sections for that uh it defines a
directed

04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
directed
 
04:49:14.590 --> 04:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
proxy it defines an undirected
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
proxy and then it says that um the the
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
votes pertaining to a unit uh if in
 
04:49:27.110 --> 04:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
person have to be at a properly noticed
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
meeting of the unit Owners Association
 
04:49:33.230 --> 04:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
which is not always quite the case uh or
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
pursuant to to a directed or undirected
 
04:49:38.230 --> 04:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
proxy and that the unit owner has the
 
04:49:40.150 --> 04:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
choice of which
 
04:49:43.868 --> 04:49:43.878 align:start position:0%
one um I do this quite easily with my
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
homeowners association I tell them all
 
04:49:48.270 --> 04:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
the things we're going to vote
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
on and um they can decide whether
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
they're directing the results on each of
 
04:49:56.480 --> 04:49:59.510 align:start position:0%
they're directing the results on each of
them

04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.110 --> 04:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh then
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:50:08.590 --> 04:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
other part of this is
 
04:50:13.548 --> 04:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
that it takes and and this part I is
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
also something I changed in the
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
amendment when I realized what we' done
 
04:50:23.070 --> 04:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
um it creates
 
04:50:26.590 --> 04:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
um a new paragraph D that they've
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
removed from paragraph B um that says
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
that it's not applying to time sharing
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
interests the time sharing Condominiums
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
if nobody has mentioned that yet uh are
 
04:50:41.948 --> 04:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
um are determined not to be involved in
 
04:50:45.430 --> 04:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
condo law and quite rightly because they
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
usually have got 52 owners for each
 
04:50:52.190 --> 04:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
unit and it would be a little difficult
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
and they run it like a
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
hotel so um that's the bill itself the
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
amendment um there is in in
 
04:51:10.510 --> 04:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
red uh put in under the voting process
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh a new subsection that says that the
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
complete text of all voting articles
 
04:51:17.230 --> 04:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
must be included in the properly noticed
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
meeting agenda voting on Amendment
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
articles amended during a meeting must
 
04:51:24.670 --> 04:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
be deferred until the next properly
 
04:51:29.708 --> 04:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
noticed meeting so that um and proper
 
04:51:31.150 --> 04:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
notice must be delivered to all
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
condominium owners um
 
04:51:39.390 --> 04:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
that that is intended to avoid them
 
04:51:42.190 --> 04:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
amending a bill that says we are going
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
to um to
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
$200 to repairing the roofs to we are
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
going to appropriate
 
04:51:55.040 --> 04:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
going to appropriate
$2,500

04:51:57.030 --> 04:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
$2,500
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
to to uh repairing the roofs without the
 
04:52:05.548 --> 04:52:05.558 align:start position:0%
membership knowing
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
and it should result in things like the
 
04:52:12.910 --> 04:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
the board finding out how much this is
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
actually going to cost and if they don't
 
04:52:18.750 --> 04:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
find it out right then like we have had
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
to do we're going to have to wait until
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
until the next meeting and they could
 
04:52:27.190 --> 04:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
call a special meeting ear quickly if
 
04:52:28.510 --> 04:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
they needed
 
04:52:33.628 --> 04:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
to so that that's the bill and the amend
 
04:52:33.638 --> 04:52:35.788 align:start position:0%
to so that that's the bill and the amend
Amendment

04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:52:39.830 --> 04:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
which on I guess I amended a little bit
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
to fit it in there but um is mostly
 
04:52:45.628 --> 04:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
written by John Cummings who I hope you
 
04:52:48.910 --> 04:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
will ask next but there is another thing
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
oh no this one isn't this one the other
 
04:52:55.070 --> 04:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
one's for the next
 
04:53:01.868 --> 04:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
bill but thank you okay so uh given
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
my uneducated
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
mine uh I would consider uh a proxy a
 
04:53:10.350 --> 04:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
piece of paper Okay first you have the
 
04:53:12.990 --> 04:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
agenda and you have the language for all
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
the different motions
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
right okay and then you'll have a
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
separate piece of paper that we're going
 
04:53:21.310 --> 04:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
to call a
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
proxy and on that proxy would be each a
 
04:53:27.628 --> 04:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
number related to the
 
04:53:30.190 --> 04:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that if at some point in time
 
04:53:31.868 --> 04:53:31.878 align:start position:0%
someone says oh you made a mistake in
 
04:53:33.390 --> 04:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment or anything's not right
 
04:53:35.590 --> 04:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
with with the amendment regardless of
 
04:53:38.070 --> 04:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
what anybody voted on the amendment
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
cannot be taken up because it's going to
 
04:53:43.948 --> 04:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
be a needs to be
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
amended and lastly directed
 
04:53:47.520 --> 04:53:49.430 align:start position:0%
amended and lastly directed
versus

04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
versus
 
04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
undirected in my mind is very important
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
because directed means when I take that
 
04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
proxy and there's going to be yes
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
no you could say
 
04:54:02.480 --> 04:54:04.270 align:start position:0%
no you could say
abstain

04:54:04.270 --> 04:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
abstain
 
04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
okay right yes no or abstain or abstain
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
could be if you just left that line on a
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
blank could still be it would default to
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
abstain but that you can't take up any
 
04:54:16.878 --> 04:54:18.868 align:start position:0%
abstain but that you can't take up any
new

04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
items you cannot expect someone at the
 
04:54:24.708 --> 04:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
meeting to say well that person really
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
does mean something differently because
 
04:54:31.470 --> 04:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
the proxy is what that person signed and
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
owns and only that can can be voted on
 
04:54:36.788 --> 04:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
the meeting if we're
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
there then we're good yeah okay we're
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
good the biggest problem that we've got
 
04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
with Condominiums comes with
 
04:54:48.430 --> 04:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
Condominiums whose members cannot get to
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
those meetings I no doubt in my mind um
 
04:54:55.470 --> 04:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
I truly appreciate that I get to vote on
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
proxies for all those stocks and
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
companies that I own and uh now I get to
 
04:55:02.030 --> 04:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
do it
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
online and
 
04:55:06.390 --> 04:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh the Nuance is that some of my stocks
 
04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
have split and divided and I have
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
multiple votes but at least it's easy
 
04:55:14.788 --> 04:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
simple and I know my vote has been been
 
04:55:17.868 --> 04:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
placed and I think this is a
 
04:55:22.230 --> 04:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful change to our condo
 
04:55:24.310 --> 04:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
statute thank
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
you okay John Cummings has yeah I got
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:55:34.430 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:55:34.440 --> 04:55:43.990 align:start position:0%
here
okay

04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
John my name is John Cummings I'm a
 
04:55:49.030 --> 04:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
condominium owner in Freedom New
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I sent my document to you I
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if I can make it some not
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
sure if you haven't seen it at all but
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
for those of us who read our emails I
 
04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
have absolutely seen it okay so passing
 
04:56:03.590 --> 04:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
HB 11129 will prevent any condo owner
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
from having to fight for their voting
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
rights like I've had to for the past two
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
years I've been in a two-year battle
 
04:56:10.948 --> 04:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
with our board of directors to be able
 
04:56:13.470 --> 04:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
to vote via directed proxies as is
 
04:56:15.390 --> 04:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
allowed under the current
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
statute this year I personally spent
 
04:56:20.470 --> 04:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
over $6,000 in legal fees fighting our
 
04:56:22.948 --> 04:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
board for the right to vote via directed
 
04:56:26.350 --> 04:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
proxy and that $6,000 was spent to
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
resolve the matter outside of
 
04:56:31.350 --> 04:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
court I was told take us to court by the
 
04:56:34.190 --> 04:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
board and my lawyer wanted another 10 to
 
04:56:36.670 --> 04:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
20 $10,000 retainer just to take it to
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
court and that probably would have cost
 
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
me quite a bit more than
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
that and to add insult to injury the
 
04:56:45.150 --> 04:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
association attorney is on a recorded
 
04:56:46.910 --> 04:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
board meeting saying directed proxies
 
04:56:49.350 --> 04:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
are allowed but I still was not allowed
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
to cast vote via directed
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
proxy I contacted the Attorney
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
General representative Susan Aly and
 
04:56:59.030 --> 04:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
several New Hampshire condo attorneys
 
04:57:01.470 --> 04:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
and they all confirmed that directed
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
proxies were allowed under the current
 
04:57:02.878 --> 04:57:03.990 align:start position:0%
proxies were allowed under the current
statute

statute
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
I presented our board with this
 
04:57:08.670 --> 04:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
information and they still denied me the
 
04:57:11.310 --> 04:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
right to vote via directed
 
04:57:13.830 --> 04:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
proxies our board is emboldened by the
 
04:57:18.270 --> 04:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
fact that condo owners have virtually no
 
04:57:20.548 --> 04:57:20.558 align:start position:0%

proxies yes um so uh again I'm here for
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh Ci's legislative action committee and
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
as a committee having looked at this
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill we supported it because uh we
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
believe it provides some additional
 
04:59:03.788 --> 04:59:03.798 align:start position:0%
Clarity to the existing law uh proxy are
 
04:59:05.948 --> 04:59:05.958 align:start position:0%
already covered in existing law that is
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
true um but uh this particular bill um
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't try to Rel legislate the issue
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't create a conflict um it
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
really just seems to clarify which we
 
04:59:20.310 --> 04:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
think is a good
 
04:59:20.320 --> 04:59:23.510 align:start position:0%

05:00:31.920 --> 05:00:42.390 align:start position:0%
 
ago

05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:42.400 --> 05:00:44.270 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:00:44.270 --> 05:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
all uh representative elme um Graft in
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
17 I think uh city of
 
05:00:58.150 --> 05:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
um you have those of you who' have been
 
05:01:03.390 --> 05:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
on this committee before have
 
05:01:06.030 --> 05:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
except for last term when it was
 
05:01:09.310 --> 05:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
kidnapped by a senator
 
05:01:11.910 --> 05:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
um and turned into something that was
 
05:01:11.920 --> 05:01:13.150 align:start position:0%
um and turned into something that was
totally

05:01:13.150 --> 05:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
totally
 
05:01:13.160 --> 05:01:14.750 align:start position:0%
totally
unrecognizable

05:01:14.750 --> 05:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
unrecognizable
 
05:01:19.390 --> 05:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
um we um we've been putting this bill in
 
05:01:20.868 --> 05:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
with more
 
05:01:24.350 --> 05:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
refinements until 2020 when it passed
 
05:01:24.360 --> 05:01:25.270 align:start position:0%
refinements until 2020 when it passed
the

05:01:25.270 --> 05:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:01:30.270 --> 05:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
house and went into uh
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
Purgatory because right right after it
 
05:01:37.470 --> 05:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
passed the house we all were sent home
 
05:01:41.350 --> 05:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
to shut down for two weeks while covid
 
05:01:45.310 --> 05:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
started to rage and when we got past the
 
05:01:48.270 --> 05:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks we were told that everybody
 
05:01:50.548 --> 05:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
else was shutting down
 
05:01:54.788 --> 05:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
too so um the bill needed a public
 
05:01:56.350 --> 05:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
Hearing in the Senate because they
 
05:01:59.470 --> 05:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
needed to understand it better um they
 
05:02:01.548 --> 05:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
were favorable to it we could have
 
05:02:05.470 --> 05:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
passed it but it didn't happen and here
 
05:02:06.750 --> 05:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
we are
 
05:02:06.760 --> 05:02:08.590 align:start position:0%
we are
again

05:02:08.590 --> 05:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:02:13.270 --> 05:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
and what it is about is how to enforce
 
05:02:15.470 --> 05:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
violations of good
 
05:02:18.070 --> 05:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
governance which means what the
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
condominium law says other state laws
 
05:02:25.230 --> 05:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
might say uh what the Declaration that
 
05:02:27.190 --> 05:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
everybody agreed to when they bought
 
05:02:29.070 --> 05:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
their unit
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
says uh and the bylaws
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
that are created then or
 
05:02:36.480 --> 05:02:39.470 align:start position:0%
that are created then or
after

05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:02:44.150 --> 05:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
um one of the problems that we have I
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention first someone had
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
said something about we don't need any
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
more condominium law the problem is that
 
05:02:55.868 --> 05:02:55.878 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
05:02:58.910 --> 05:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
Declarations were written by the
 
05:03:01.470 --> 05:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
developers and they were written with
 
05:03:04.230 --> 05:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
requirements that
 
05:03:08.910 --> 05:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
2third or 60% of the members had to vote
 
05:03:12.150 --> 05:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
to approve a change in the
 
05:03:15.470 --> 05:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
bylaws uh and that you can't approve a
 
05:03:18.350 --> 05:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
change in the
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
Declaration but they
 
05:03:27.390 --> 05:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
are the developer and his interests are
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
primary in that declaration and bylaws
 
05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
and it didn't matter to the people
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
people in 1970 whatever it was uh that
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
wrote the first condominium
 
05:03:39.958 --> 05:03:42.390 align:start position:0%
wrote the first condominium
law

05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
because at that time what they were
 
05:03:48.430 --> 05:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
really worried about was corrupt
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
developers people that sold people lots
 
05:03:54.030 --> 05:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
that didn't exist people that uh sold
 
05:03:58.190 --> 05:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
people houses that were grade grade F
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
when when they' promised them grade
 
05:04:04.708 --> 05:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
A or they' promised them not to put
 
05:04:06.628 --> 05:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
another house right at their doorstep
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
and they did anyway
 
05:04:11.788 --> 05:04:11.798 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:04:16.110 --> 05:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
um so it wasn't um they weren't thinking
 
05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
about okay now you've got a condominium
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
which is volunteer people running AB
 
05:04:24.350 --> 05:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
board this is what I started with when I
 
05:04:27.030 --> 05:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
got into this 15 years ago or whatever
 
05:04:29.190 --> 05:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
it was you've got volunteer people
 
05:04:29.200 --> 05:04:30.350 align:start position:0%
it was you've got volunteer people
running

05:04:30.350 --> 05:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
running
 
05:04:33.868 --> 05:04:33.878 align:start position:0%
aboard um maybe you've got a septic
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
system like we
 
05:04:39.990 --> 05:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
do maybe you've got uh a lot of
 
05:04:42.628 --> 05:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
roads that you have to fix every now and
 
05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
then there's a whole lot of things that
 
05:04:47.948 --> 05:04:47.958 align:start position:0%
are decisions of the
 
05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh of
 
05:04:54.270 --> 05:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
the condominium Group which are
 
05:04:58.510 --> 05:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
equivalent to Decisions by the people in
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
municipality but the Municipal
 
05:05:07.628 --> 05:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
Association helps the boards of the
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the Town Council and
 
05:05:13.948 --> 05:05:13.958 align:start position:0%
the and the the the city council or the
 
05:05:17.110 --> 05:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
town Selectmen or the alderman it helps
 
05:05:21.150 --> 05:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
them figure out how to govern gives them
 
05:05:23.708 --> 05:05:23.718 align:start position:0%
trainings provides them guide books all
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff so they really um the
 
05:05:30.350 --> 05:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
05:05:32.990 --> 05:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
condominium uh situation
 
05:05:36.390 --> 05:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
only have the state
 
05:05:39.628 --> 05:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
law and that makes things pretty
 
05:05:43.750 --> 05:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
difficult this situation was solved for
 
05:05:43.760 --> 05:05:45.270 align:start position:0%
difficult this situation was solved for
manufactured

05:05:45.270 --> 05:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured
 
05:05:45.280 --> 05:05:47.430 align:start position:0%
manufactured
housing

05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:05:52.628 --> 05:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of the 90s or the 80s I
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
can't remember but they set up uh a
 
05:05:58.750 --> 05:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
condomini a manufact a manufactured
 
05:05:58.760 --> 05:05:59.830 align:start position:0%
condomini a manufact a manufactured
housing

05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
board and this spill is based on what
 
05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
that manufactured housing board
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
did and what it did basically was to
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
have a group of people from all sides of
 
05:06:16.868 --> 05:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
the of the trailer
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
parks uh plus a independent
 
05:06:24.628 --> 05:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
lawyer as volunteers meeting on a
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
regular basis to look at
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
complaints and they would decide whether
 
05:06:34.390 --> 05:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
the complaint was reasonable or
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
unreasonable fit into existing laws
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
somehow or didn't but they would
 
05:06:43.628 --> 05:06:43.638 align:start position:0%
actually create law what they would do
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
is they would make a decision the lawyer
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
always wrote it um they would make a
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
decision and they would uh send it uh
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
they would do a synthesis of the of the
 
05:07:01.830 --> 05:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh decision and they would put it in the
 
05:07:05.310 --> 05:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
files of the superior court of that
 
05:07:08.430 --> 05:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
County and it would sit in the superior
 
05:07:08.440 --> 05:07:10.110 align:start position:0%
County and it would sit in the superior
court

05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
court
 
05:07:14.670 --> 05:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
for uh six months I think it was uh and
 
05:07:17.230 --> 05:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
if nobody appealed that decision from
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
the two
 
05:07:20.510 --> 05:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
groups that were represented in the
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
trailer park they would um it would
 
05:07:27.150 --> 05:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
become case
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
law and across the
 
05:07:34.350 --> 05:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
state a judge that got a case from
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
people who were aggrieved about in a
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
trailer park would pull this this
 
05:07:44.470 --> 05:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
decision out and say okay um this is
 
05:07:47.788 --> 05:07:47.798 align:start position:0%
what that board decided and I I agree
 
05:07:49.590 --> 05:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
with it or I don't agree with it but
 
05:07:51.510 --> 05:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
they would use it as the basis of their
 
05:07:55.030 --> 05:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
decision it would be a very short short
 
05:07:59.750 --> 05:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
case uh and the judge could establish
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
remedies after that this is what were're
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
looking for in condominium law because
 
05:08:09.310 --> 05:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
we can't put every little detail of
 
05:08:13.350 --> 05:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
everything into the condominium law even
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
if then people would read it and the
 
05:08:18.708 --> 05:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
boards would obey it we don't have an
 
05:08:18.718 --> 05:08:20.270 align:start position:0%
boards would obey it we don't have an
enforcement

05:08:20.270 --> 05:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:08:25.708 --> 05:08:25.718 align:start position:0%
mechanism um I am really happy to say
 
05:08:29.548 --> 05:08:29.558 align:start position:0%
that oh I also have this I hadn't handed
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
out I've got to get to amendments next
 
05:08:35.470 --> 05:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm really happy to say that um some
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
of these amendments are because I was
 
05:08:41.948 --> 05:08:41.958 align:start position:0%
contacted by the head of the Consumer
 
05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau in the AG's office and
 
05:08:49.948 --> 05:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
um offered some things that they thought
 
05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
should be fixed which this is a first
 
05:08:55.788 --> 05:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
attempt this amendment um part of this
 
05:08:59.708 --> 05:08:59.718 align:start position:0%
amendment to do that um so that the
 
05:09:02.350 --> 05:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
legal procedure would go smoothly and
 
05:09:05.150 --> 05:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
that then they would be willing to help
 
05:09:09.708 --> 05:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
out in the past um they haven't had
 
05:09:12.548 --> 05:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
enough Personnel in the AG's office and
 
05:09:15.910 --> 05:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
please don't take this decision that we
 
05:09:18.670 --> 05:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
ought to remove some of them again but
 
05:09:21.470 --> 05:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
they haven't had enough of them so that
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
they could deal with
 
05:09:25.788 --> 05:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
cases that
 
05:09:28.910 --> 05:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
affected Condominiums they would just
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
when you when you called up they would
 
05:09:32.390 --> 05:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
say we're sorry but you're going to have
 
05:09:33.868 --> 05:09:33.878 align:start position:0%
to find a
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
lawyer finding a lawyer has been
 
05:09:39.788 --> 05:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily difficult but um some
 
05:09:42.190 --> 05:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
other people might mention that
 
05:09:42.200 --> 05:09:44.548 align:start position:0%
other people might mention that
and

05:09:44.548 --> 05:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:44.558 --> 05:09:46.670 align:start position:0%
and
uh

05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:09:50.150 --> 05:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
so the dispute that that's essentially
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
what that dispute board
 
05:09:59.230 --> 05:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
does it it creates an efficient process
 
05:10:02.230 --> 05:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
that takes most of the burden away from
 
05:10:05.310 --> 05:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
the AG's office which isn't doing it
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't doing it at any rate I think
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's someone here from his office
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
who's going to to be speaking um
 
05:10:19.948 --> 05:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
and I'll
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.040 --> 05:11:10.548 align:start position:0%
 
out

05:11:10.548 --> 05:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:20.110 --> 05:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
one the first thing is on page
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
one uh lines 9 to
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
11 on this I add it on my own actually
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:40.990 --> 05:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
or anyway um three members who are
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
resident unit owners not just owners of
 
05:11:48.510 --> 05:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
Condominiums um that was from m co
 
05:11:52.070 --> 05:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
conspirator uh
 
05:11:56.750 --> 05:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
who who uh misread it as being possibly
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
saying on three members who were owners
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
um which would be for instance a
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
developer who still hadn't let go um but
 
05:12:14.708 --> 05:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
neither I wrote in neither members
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
appointed under this subparagraph nor
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
their immediate household members shall
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
be members of their respective
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
condominium board that are in that
 
05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
membership group for the board
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
um and then after that the filing fee
 
05:12:35.110 --> 05:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
that we've been putting in is
 
05:12:40.190 --> 05:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
$250 we didn't want it to be more than a
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
single individual with a really bad case
 
05:12:49.070 --> 05:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
could afford to do but today with
 
05:12:51.430 --> 05:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
expenses the way are they are and
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
frankly with what's been done to the
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board um we thought
 
05:13:03.390 --> 05:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
that it it ought to go up to
 
05:13:07.708 --> 05:13:07.718 align:start position:0%
500 um but it's something that needs
 
05:13:11.628 --> 05:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
hasn't been discussed for instance in my
 
05:13:13.230 --> 05:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
cond of study committee which hasn't
 
05:13:14.830 --> 05:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
been able to meet
 
05:13:14.840 --> 05:13:17.190 align:start position:0%
been able to meet
enough

05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
enough
 
05:13:19.030 --> 05:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:13:21.708 --> 05:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
then on page
 
05:13:24.510 --> 05:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
three when we're looking at the
 
05:13:27.628 --> 05:13:27.638 align:start position:0%
decisions and this is in response to
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
what um the head of the of the Consumer
 
05:13:37.670 --> 05:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:42.990 --> 05:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:43.000 --> 05:13:47.070 align:start position:0%
 
me

05:13:47.070 --> 05:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:50.948 --> 05:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of of changes page
 
05:13:54.788 --> 05:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
three line 8 the order uh when the board
 
05:13:56.830 --> 05:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
makes its decision an order shall be
 
05:13:58.510 --> 05:13:58.520 align:start position:0%

05:14:07.470 --> 05:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
facts suround supporting the
 
05:14:10.350 --> 05:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
findings um and I put in the order shall
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
include the actions that must be taken
 
05:14:15.390 --> 05:14:15.400 align:start position:0%

05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
complaint within a specific time frame
 
05:14:20.670 --> 05:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's the right
 
05:14:24.190 --> 05:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
language that was what uh in response to
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:30.680 --> 05:14:32.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:14:32.948 --> 05:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%

toally so brandan Brandon
 
05:14:45.510 --> 05:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
Gard um and then Below in line 17 to
 
05:14:50.788 --> 05:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
20 uh the dis first the existing languag
 
05:14:52.510 --> 05:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
is a decision of the board may be
 
05:14:55.548 --> 05:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
appealed by either party following a
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
request to for
 
05:15:00.270 --> 05:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
rehearing by applying for an appeal to
 
05:15:04.030 --> 05:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
the superior court of the County um if
 
05:15:06.868 --> 05:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
no timely appeal is taken pursuant to
 
05:15:08.750 --> 05:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
that paragraph the decision of the board
 
05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
shall become final this is the part I
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
was talking to you about about it sits
 
05:15:16.708 --> 05:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
with the superior court for a while and
 
05:15:19.470 --> 05:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
after enough time is passed it is filed
 
05:15:20.910 --> 05:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
as case
 
05:15:25.230 --> 05:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
law uh but then I added um
 
05:15:29.310 --> 05:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
four I guess I added four twice um in
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
the event that the decision of the board
 
05:15:34.270 --> 05:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
is dis disregarded by one of the parties
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
and this is what we frequently get um
 
05:15:42.910 --> 05:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
from just ordinary attempts of people to
 
05:15:45.510 --> 05:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
help out and to get the board to do what
 
05:15:48.390 --> 05:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
is in the the
 
05:15:51.230 --> 05:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
rsas in the event it is disregarded by
 
05:15:53.548 --> 05:15:53.558 align:start position:0%
one of the parties at any time after the
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
Certified Abstract of the decision is
 
05:15:58.270 --> 05:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
filed with the court the grieved party
 
05:16:01.110 --> 05:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
May appeal to the court for enforcement
 
05:16:02.590 --> 05:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
and which point the court of the
 
05:16:04.868 --> 05:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
Superior Court the judge of the Superior
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
Court May apply civil penalties
 
05:16:10.750 --> 05:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
including fines and restitution leveled
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
on the condominium manager board members
 
05:16:16.548 --> 05:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
or disruptive unit owner that might be a
 
05:16:19.230 --> 05:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
little controversial but I felt that it
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
should not be levied on the condominium
 
05:16:26.110 --> 05:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
because frequently the practice that
 
05:16:30.990 --> 05:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
that one or 10 people are are um trying
 
05:16:33.230 --> 05:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
to get stopped has been hurting
 
05:16:34.910 --> 05:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else in the Condominium
 
05:16:38.230 --> 05:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
Association too so that is what I came
 
05:16:40.430 --> 05:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
up with but it's something to be
 
05:16:43.708 --> 05:16:43.718 align:start position:0%
discussed the right of either and then
 
05:16:46.350 --> 05:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
another four the right of either party
 
05:16:49.470 --> 05:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
to separately file a lawsuit challenging
 
05:16:51.390 --> 05:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
the final decision of the board shall
 
05:16:54.350 --> 05:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
not be infringed in which case the board
 
05:16:56.110 --> 05:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
shall be represented by the Department
 
05:17:02.590 --> 05:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
of Justice the first part of that was um
 
05:17:08.350 --> 05:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
um told me um sternly by Brandon Gard
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
the assist senior Assistant Attorney
 
05:17:14.510 --> 05:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
General on the second part of it I
 
05:17:17.670 --> 05:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
added because it only seems fair that
 
05:17:19.990 --> 05:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
they should help out at that point but
 
05:17:23.670 --> 05:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that may be
 
05:17:28.990 --> 05:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
disputed um and then then the rest of
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
this is about the
 
05:17:35.230 --> 05:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and what's we're likely to
 
05:17:39.070 --> 05:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
be doing about the fiscal note uh the
 
05:17:41.830 --> 05:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board operated with
 
05:17:44.590 --> 05:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
one Administrative
 
05:17:48.670 --> 05:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
Assistant for 30 about 25 years before
 
05:17:50.390 --> 05:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
they were starting to work themselves
 
05:17:52.628 --> 05:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
out out of a job and they were operating
 
05:17:55.270 --> 05:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
after that with about a tenth of a
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
person and
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason that this can't be
 
05:18:06.590 --> 05:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
be done without what is now called a
 
05:18:10.788 --> 05:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
board manager I
 
05:18:14.548 --> 05:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
believe a board uh I've got it admin
 
05:18:14.558 --> 05:18:15.990 align:start position:0%
believe a board uh I've got it admin
board

05:18:15.990 --> 05:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:18:18.910 --> 05:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
administrator on but they gave us a
 
05:18:21.390 --> 05:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that said that it is the
 
05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
board administrator plus a lawyer plus a
 
05:18:26.080 --> 05:18:28.670 align:start position:0%
board administrator plus a lawyer plus a
um

05:18:28.670 --> 05:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:28.680 --> 05:18:30.310 align:start position:0%
um
researcher

05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
05:18:30.320 --> 05:18:33.910 align:start position:0%
researcher
um

05:18:33.910 --> 05:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
board administrator investigator
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and hearings officer and each
 
05:18:41.868 --> 05:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
of those grades gets more
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
expensive uh the board administrat by
 
05:18:49.470 --> 05:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
themselves would be about $80,000 a
 
05:18:54.548 --> 05:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
year and um that's what we need given
 
05:18:57.750 --> 05:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
the structure we've got and I have an
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
appointment Thursday afternoon with the
 
05:19:06.390 --> 05:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
head of um the office of professional
 
05:19:09.948 --> 05:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
licenser and certification who I worked
 
05:19:14.150 --> 05:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
with on a occasion in small ways um to
 
05:19:15.990 --> 05:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
discuss the fiscal note which she could
 
05:19:18.430 --> 05:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
not remember
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
so so I'm hoping that the fiscal note is
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to change
 
05:19:28.510 --> 05:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
radically but on it also would require I
 
05:19:31.470 --> 05:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
presume a board administrator position
 
05:19:35.390 --> 05:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
labor grade 19 which is I've put in
 
05:19:38.510 --> 05:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
there at the end as a kind of place
 
05:19:42.948 --> 05:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
Setter for that so
 
05:19:45.948 --> 05:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's all of the
 
05:19:49.270 --> 05:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
Amendments that I've got
 
05:19:54.548 --> 05:19:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.708 --> 05:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
late and if anyone doesn't have one I
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
seem to I seem to have printed them out
 
05:20:00.160 --> 05:20:03.030 align:start position:0%
seem to I seem to have printed them out
twice

05:20:03.030 --> 05:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
twice
 
05:20:05.310 --> 05:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
um maybe you want to did you give one to
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
Mr SC scura from the doj that might
 
05:20:12.190 --> 05:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
forance testimony we have questions I
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't uh I saw representative Gibbs
 
05:20:15.948 --> 05:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
hands first and then representative Bros
 
05:20:18.670 --> 05:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
represent representative Gibs question
 
05:20:20.868 --> 05:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh let me just wait for
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:28.190 --> 05:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
down thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:20:32.310 --> 05:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative elme um uh uh first of
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
all I want to thank you uh for
 
05:20:37.350 --> 05:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing the fact that an employee
 
05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
would probably be required and therefore
 
05:20:42.190 --> 05:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
that an appropriation would be required
 
05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
um we've had some bills that came before
 
05:20:46.390 --> 05:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
us that were not so practical but I do
 
05:20:50.190 --> 05:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
have a technical question um uh which
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
regards the language uh at the bottom of
 
05:20:56.070 --> 05:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
page three uh where the final paragraph
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
deals with an annual report and um lines
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh 34 and 35 um uh says that the annual
 
05:21:08.510 --> 05:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
report should uh should contain the
 
05:21:11.590 --> 05:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
number of complaints received uh and the
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
number of complaints accepted and
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
rejected um I'm figuring that complaints
 
05:21:18.868 --> 05:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
accepted means complaints accepted for
 
05:21:21.830 --> 05:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
review by the board and rejected means
 
05:21:23.670 --> 05:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
complaints that were were not accepted
 
05:21:25.548 --> 05:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
for review by the board because they're
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
outside the board's purview but don't
 
05:21:32.070 --> 05:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
you think that that should be followed
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
by some additional language requiring
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the report include the number of
 
05:21:40.628 --> 05:21:40.638 align:start position:0%
complaints resolved or decided and the
 
05:21:43.548 --> 05:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
number of complaints decided for or
 
05:21:48.150 --> 05:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:50.110 --> 05:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
complainant shouldn't there be an
 
05:21:52.708 --> 05:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
additional amendment to that effect that
 
05:21:54.788 --> 05:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
that would probably be a very useful
 
05:21:59.470 --> 05:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:01.788 --> 05:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
burs I would I'm sorry just um if I
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
could add to that um the complaints
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
would be rejected if they did not fit
 
05:22:17.470 --> 05:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
within the language which is in here
 
05:22:22.708 --> 05:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
about um on page two starting page line
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
19 uh that it we're talking about
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
failure by the Condominium Association
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
to follow its declaration in b laws
 
05:22:34.708 --> 05:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
failure to follow proper voting
 
05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
procedures as defined in
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
b39 uh RSA 356 b39 other actions not in
 
05:22:45.910 --> 05:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
compliance with condominium instruments
 
05:22:47.948 --> 05:22:47.958 align:start position:0%
or the Condominium
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
Act so uh there's something I call Pink
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
Flamingos which is a very frequent kind
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
of complaint uh in in
 
05:23:01.948 --> 05:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
condominiums that you will allow
 
05:23:05.788 --> 05:23:05.798 align:start position:0%
or um you allow one person to put plank
 
05:23:07.548 --> 05:23:07.558 align:start position:0%
flamingos in their lawn and you don't
 
05:23:13.070 --> 05:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
allow someone else to put put uh purple
 
05:23:16.510 --> 05:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
ones and things like that things that
 
05:23:19.750 --> 05:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
are are not related to the
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
governance you had a brief followup
 
05:23:26.110 --> 05:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gibs thank you uh yes um
 
05:23:28.190 --> 05:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think you and I are in agreement
 
05:23:29.948 --> 05:23:29.958 align:start position:0%
about the meaning of of complaints
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
accepted or rejected
 
05:23:33.868 --> 05:23:33.878 align:start position:0%
what I was suggesting is that some
 
05:23:36.510 --> 05:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
additional information be required
 
05:23:39.270 --> 05:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
regarding decisions that have been made
 
05:23:41.830 --> 05:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh by the board so that the number of
 
05:23:45.788 --> 05:23:45.798 align:start position:0%
decisions uh be reported and the number
 
05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh of complaints decided for the
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
complainant or against the
 
05:23:53.470 --> 05:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
complainant and maybe those that are
 
05:23:55.830 --> 05:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
still in Pro the number that's still in
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
process yes all right and so we're we're
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
making suggestions
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so that would be a would you believe
 
05:24:05.708 --> 05:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
right and this will go to a subcommittee
 
05:24:07.708 --> 05:24:07.718 align:start position:0%
so uh perhaps you right two might want
 
05:24:10.030 --> 05:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
to reach out and work out that detail
 
05:24:11.788 --> 05:24:11.798 align:start position:0%
before the subcommittee representative
 
05:24:15.150 --> 05:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
Bros okay thanks for taking my question
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
um I see in the fiscal note that they
 
05:24:21.430 --> 05:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
are that the oplc was unable to estimate
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
how many condominium associations exist
 
05:24:26.110 --> 05:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so I guess my question
 
05:24:28.548 --> 05:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
is we don't know the number of
 
05:24:30.390 --> 05:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
Condominiums how might we know the
 
05:24:31.990 --> 05:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
number of of complaints that might get
 
05:24:34.628 --> 05:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
in and therefore how do we know that we
 
05:24:37.868 --> 05:24:37.878 align:start position:0%
need this um outlay of
 
05:24:43.190 --> 05:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
$374,000 right well the
 
05:24:47.230 --> 05:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
kai uh thinks that there are roughly one
 
05:24:50.670 --> 05:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh one condominium unit for every six
 
05:24:52.190 --> 05:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
people living in New
 
05:24:54.868 --> 05:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm not so sure about that
 
05:24:57.350 --> 05:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
because I think a bunch of them are
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
second owner Condominiums and they don't
 
05:25:02.708 --> 05:25:02.718 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire most of them um
 
05:25:05.948 --> 05:25:05.958 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to figure this out I've
 
05:25:07.708 --> 05:25:07.718 align:start position:0%
been trying to talk with the wrong
 
05:25:10.270 --> 05:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
people in the Census Bureau for a couple
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
of years now and I finally got told
 
05:25:14.590 --> 05:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
which people to try and talk to that
 
05:25:17.430 --> 05:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
they're in HUD but I haven't had time to
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
follow up um but that isn't the relevant
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
part the the word the most important
 
05:25:25.110 --> 05:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
part of it is something we also don't
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
know which is how many condominium
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
associations are off the
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:31.390 align:start position:0%
associations are off the
rails

05:25:31.390 --> 05:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
rails
 
05:25:35.548 --> 05:25:35.558 align:start position:0%
and there are an awful lot of
 
05:25:37.830 --> 05:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
people well I shouldn't say an awful lot
 
05:25:42.430 --> 05:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
of people among the the maybe two dozen
 
05:25:44.350 --> 05:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
different groups of people that we've
 
05:25:46.470 --> 05:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
heard from over the years that have
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
actually figured out that the
 
05:25:51.270 --> 05:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
condominium study committee
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
exists uh there have been
 
05:26:00.110 --> 05:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh they they all we find out about
 
05:26:02.190 --> 05:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
because they gone off the
 
05:26:04.670 --> 05:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
rails they're
 
05:26:08.470 --> 05:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
disobeying our law they're disobeying
 
05:26:08.480 --> 05:26:09.708 align:start position:0%
disobeying our law they're disobeying
their

05:26:09.708 --> 05:26:09.718 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
law uh sometimes they've actually
 
05:26:17.390 --> 05:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
lost significant documents that could be
 
05:26:17.400 --> 05:26:18.948 align:start position:0%
lost significant documents that could be
used

05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:26:18.958 --> 05:26:21.830 align:start position:0%
used
um

05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:24.750 --> 05:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
05:26:27.910 --> 05:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
this that's how many the problem with
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
how many complaints are there going to
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
be first
 
05:26:35.150 --> 05:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
you don't we don't have a method to
 
05:26:38.390 --> 05:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
spread this around though if we had such
 
05:26:40.910 --> 05:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
a board I think it would spread more
 
05:26:44.430 --> 05:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
easily um partly
 
05:26:48.750 --> 05:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
because the um consumer protection
 
05:26:51.788 --> 05:26:51.798 align:start position:0%
Department would be telling them about
 
05:26:55.350 --> 05:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
05:26:58.868 --> 05:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
and but we have no idea how many there
 
05:27:02.548 --> 05:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
there would be oh follow question so I
 
05:27:04.990 --> 05:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
guess I guess the question is we don't
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
know how many complaints are going to
 
05:27:09.310 --> 05:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
come in but yet we're we're suggesting
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
that there be a staff of four people for
 
05:27:15.590 --> 05:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
$374,000 so I'm trying to wrap my head
 
05:27:19.230 --> 05:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
around that well that's just the first
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
part of that that fiscal note problem
 
05:27:25.030 --> 05:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
they don't need an investigator the
 
05:27:29.230 --> 05:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
investigation gets done by people for
 
05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
and against coming to the the board and
 
05:27:32.830 --> 05:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
talking to
 
05:27:37.150 --> 05:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
them and then perhaps a little bit of
 
05:27:39.350 --> 05:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
factchecking by those
 
05:27:39.360 --> 05:27:40.990 align:start position:0%
factchecking by those
volunteers

05:27:40.990 --> 05:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
05:27:45.070 --> 05:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
um but a prosecutor there isn't going to
 
05:27:49.110 --> 05:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
be a prosecutor it's the board and then
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
if the board is disregarded then it goes
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
to the court but it goes to the court
 
05:27:58.590 --> 05:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
with the decision of the
 
05:28:03.390 --> 05:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
board and which usually takes priority
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
but the judge gets to decide whether he
 
05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
thinks that that board has gone off the
 
05:28:11.190 --> 05:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
rails so it's an extra guideline in
 
05:28:14.390 --> 05:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
there uh before the judge then decides
 
05:28:17.230 --> 05:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
what he thinks appropriate penalty for
 
05:28:19.868 --> 05:28:19.878 align:start position:0%
never giving minutes is so so quick
 
05:28:21.990 --> 05:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
followup on that yeah and there's no
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
hearing office one more followup so are
 
05:28:25.548 --> 05:28:25.558 align:start position:0%
you saying that we don't need any of
 
05:28:27.590 --> 05:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
these people we need a board
 
05:28:29.310 --> 05:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
administrator I don't know if they have
 
05:28:30.910 --> 05:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
to be labor grade
 
05:28:32.070 --> 05:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
but we don't know how many people are
 
05:28:33.910 --> 05:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
going to complain but we need the board
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
administrator well the board
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
administrator well if they only get five
 
05:28:41.590 --> 05:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
complaints that board administrator is
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
going to be doing something else in
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
oplc and the budget people are probably
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
going to have something to say with them
 
05:28:51.628 --> 05:28:51.638 align:start position:0%
about it the next
 
05:28:53.708 --> 05:28:53.718 align:start position:0%
time if we
 
05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
get 100 complaints um in three
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
months then I I think that OPC is going
 
05:29:04.948 --> 05:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
to be complaining a
 
05:29:09.708 --> 05:29:09.718 align:start position:0%
little what happened in uh the old days
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
was that
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
the um manufactured housing Bo board had
 
05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
taken um had been put into the oplc or
 
05:29:23.230 --> 05:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
its predecessor I think it was called
 
05:29:27.190 --> 05:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
something else then um
 
05:29:30.548 --> 05:29:30.558 align:start position:0%
and and because the services that are
 
05:29:32.030 --> 05:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
provided in
 
05:29:34.868 --> 05:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
general uh the administrative services
 
05:29:40.270 --> 05:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
for a board are um are needed to be put
 
05:29:43.470 --> 05:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere and they do a good job of that
 
05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
now I I have one question for you
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%

Freedom the owners have virtually no
 
05:31:43.070 --> 05:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
recourse at all to uh go after the
 
05:31:46.270 --> 05:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
boards for these violations I've heard
 
05:31:49.788 --> 05:31:49.798 align:start position:0%
that we can simply hire an attorney but
 
05:31:52.150 --> 05:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
I fought the directed proxy issue and it
 
05:31:53.830 --> 05:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
took me a long time to find an attorney
 
05:31:57.030 --> 05:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
to fight for me I had I got a hold a few
 
05:31:58.830 --> 05:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys that they agreed with my case
 
05:32:00.910 --> 05:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
but they said they couldn't take it
 
05:32:04.150 --> 05:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
because they would uh it would prevent
 
05:32:06.230 --> 05:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
them for getting hired from boards for
 
05:32:09.150 --> 05:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
doing work for board the board attorney
 
05:32:11.628 --> 05:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
so our Board of director selectively
 
05:32:14.830 --> 05:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
follows RSA 356 with a confidence that
 
05:32:17.590 --> 05:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
they it is very unlikely that an owner
 
05:32:19.070 --> 05:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
will challenge them in
 
05:32:21.470 --> 05:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
court and they're also playing with
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
house money as opposed to an owner who
 
05:32:25.590 --> 05:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
has to put up you know 10 or $20,000 up
 
05:32:28.110 --> 05:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
his own pocket to take somebody to court
 
05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
over an
 
05:32:32.230 --> 05:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
issue and if they lose they might end up
 
05:32:34.830 --> 05:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
paying the association's expense which I
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
think it's one of the RSB 34 maybe
 
05:32:41.830 --> 05:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
whatever that is as we have to the loser
 
05:32:46.990 --> 05:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
pays all fees so without a dispute
 
05:32:50.190 --> 05:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
board we don't have much other help the
 
05:32:51.948 --> 05:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
Attorney General won't
 
05:32:51.958 --> 05:32:56.030 align:start position:0%
Attorney General won't
help

05:32:56.030 --> 05:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:58.230 --> 05:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what else to say about
 
05:33:00.270 --> 05:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
that we need some something short going
 
05:33:00.280 --> 05:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
that we need some something short going
to

05:33:01.590 --> 05:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:33:04.470 --> 05:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
court and less expensive than that to
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:09.868 --> 05:33:09.878 align:start position:0%
issues so please consider a support for
 
05:33:11.310 --> 05:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank
 
05:33:13.030 --> 05:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for your
 
05:33:14.670 --> 05:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
testimony any
 
05:33:17.350 --> 05:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
05:33:18.470 --> 05:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
you very
 
05:33:22.750 --> 05:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
much uh we have three from
 
05:33:26.670 --> 05:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
Cai uh do you want to pick one member of
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
your team and
 
05:33:28.958 --> 05:33:33.670 align:start position:0%
your team and
okay

05:33:33.670 --> 05:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
and your name is
 
05:33:40.190 --> 05:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
Gary didario all right and uh you you
 
05:33:45.150 --> 05:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.030 --> 05:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
minutes hi yes um I will try to be uh
 
05:33:51.628 --> 05:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
brief as Paul just mentioned we've uh
 
05:33:54.030 --> 05:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
narrowed our group down from three uh
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
speakers to one um uh again uh we're
 
05:34:00.910 --> 05:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
from Cai the legislative action
 
05:34:04.270 --> 05:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
committee for um the New Hampshire
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
Branch uh CII is a National Organization
 
05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're a nonprofit they exist solely uh
 
05:34:14.830 --> 05:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
to make uh life in community settings
 
05:34:17.070 --> 05:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
better um that is what they do on a
 
05:34:20.230 --> 05:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
nationwide basis we would urge uh the
 
05:34:22.868 --> 05:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature to adopt what
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
their policy is on a national level
 
05:34:27.470 --> 05:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
which is that Condominiums are
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
self-governing associations um um they
 
05:34:33.030 --> 05:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
are not just allowed but obligated to
 
05:34:34.990 --> 05:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
self-govern through condominium
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
instruments like the Declaration and the
 
05:34:41.910 --> 05:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
bylaws and uh Ci's position is that uh
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
like so many other issues what a given
 
05:34:47.990 --> 05:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
Association needs for a dispute
 
05:34:50.510 --> 05:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
resolution process varies from
 
05:34:53.670 --> 05:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
Association to Association so best to
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
let them make their own there's nothing
 
05:34:58.910 --> 05:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
stopping any association from doing that
 
05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
um I represent associations that have
 
05:35:04.670 --> 05:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
such policies in place um I've been to
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
these types of meetings that occur on an
 
05:35:09.470 --> 05:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
in-house basis and I can tell you that
 
05:35:12.910 --> 05:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
they do work problems get resolved um in
 
05:35:15.910 --> 05:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
a particular uh instance there was a
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
case that allowed because we were at the
 
05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
association engaging in their in-house
 
05:35:22.868 --> 05:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
process it allowed us to do something
 
05:35:25.110 --> 05:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
that I don't even think could be done if
 
05:35:27.310 --> 05:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
we were standing before some sort of
 
05:35:30.270 --> 05:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
state agency or or state board uh it was
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
a noise issue between two neighbors and
 
05:35:35.470 --> 05:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh the neighbors allowed us obviously
 
05:35:37.868 --> 05:35:37.878 align:start position:0%
with their consent uh we went to the
 
05:35:41.350 --> 05:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
units involved we stood in one unit went
 
05:35:43.190 --> 05:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
outside went back in the other unit
 
05:35:45.230 --> 05:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
turned on the TV and one turned on the
 
05:35:47.590 --> 05:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
radio and another we went back and forth
 
05:35:49.910 --> 05:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
and people were actually able to learn
 
05:35:52.350 --> 05:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
what it sounds like when the the noise
 
05:35:54.270 --> 05:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
comes through the wall uh the two
 
05:35:56.030 --> 05:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors each felt that they got
 
05:35:57.868 --> 05:35:57.878 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an education as to each
 
05:36:00.350 --> 05:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
other's perspective and ultimately
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
through the exercise we identified the
 
05:36:05.070 --> 05:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
volume levels uh that would be
 
05:36:07.310 --> 05:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable uh within their devices and
 
05:36:10.110 --> 05:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
the problem was resolved um again I I
 
05:36:13.628 --> 05:36:13.638 align:start position:0%
don't think that type of um sort of
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
atome process or resolution could have
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
happened even if we were uh before a
 
05:36:21.190 --> 05:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
state board just because we're no longer
 
05:36:23.070 --> 05:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
at the condominium we don't have the
 
05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
ability to do those sorts of things um
 
05:36:29.110 --> 05:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
so largely uh we advocate for
 
05:36:31.150 --> 05:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
Association being able to do this on
 
05:36:34.390 --> 05:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
their own um to the extent uh if it is
 
05:36:37.270 --> 05:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
the case that this legislature uh feels
 
05:36:40.590 --> 05:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
that legislation is necessary uh we
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
think that the appropriate legislation
 
05:36:44.430 --> 05:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
would be something similar to what has
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
been done with other issues where um the
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
Condominium Act says that the bylaws
 
05:36:49.680 --> 05:36:51.150 align:start position:0%
Condominium Act says that the bylaws
shall

05:36:51.150 --> 05:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
shall
 
05:36:54.350 --> 05:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
include and then a statement such as a
 
05:36:56.350 --> 05:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
process for resolving disputes with the
 
05:37:00.310 --> 05:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
unit owners um the the existing law says
 
05:37:02.350 --> 05:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
that about other things and because the
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
law says that when these documents are
 
05:37:07.670 --> 05:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
drafted these items are put in um our
 
05:37:10.270 --> 05:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
other issues with this particular Bill
 
05:37:13.470 --> 05:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh include the fact that it's not only
 
05:37:15.948 --> 05:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
creating new government but with that
 
05:37:19.948 --> 05:37:19.958 align:start position:0%
new cost and uh it's to me particularly
 
05:37:21.548 --> 05:37:21.558 align:start position:0%
troubling that the new government would
 
05:37:24.670 --> 05:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
be uh what I will call a oneway street
 
05:37:28.190 --> 05:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I will explain um this new board not
 
05:37:30.430 --> 05:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
withstanding that it would be a state
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
board would accept complaints from unit
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
owners about their Association but would
 
05:37:40.110 --> 05:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
not accept complaints from Association
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
about a unit owner that's violating the
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
rules so even though it's a a sort of
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
segment of the New Hampshire state
 
05:37:50.030 --> 05:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
government um it would only be catering
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
to the needs of sort of one side of the
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
equation and not the other which I think
 
05:37:57.070 --> 05:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
from an equity uh perspective is
 
05:38:00.030 --> 05:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
problematic other procedural issues that
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
we see are that this board would make an
 
05:38:06.948 --> 05:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
initial determination about the merits
 
05:38:10.070 --> 05:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
of a complaint without ever hearing from
 
05:38:11.590 --> 05:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
the accused
 
05:38:14.548 --> 05:38:14.558 align:start position:0%
Association and um this bill has come up
 
05:38:16.390 --> 05:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
before and I've said this before but it
 
05:38:18.670 --> 05:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
it Bears repeating I'll I'll provide an
 
05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
easy example my theory is that in a
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
vacuum meaning if this board doesn't
 
05:38:26.670 --> 05:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
receive any input from the accused
 
05:38:29.270 --> 05:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
Association in a vacuum my theory is
 
05:38:32.070 --> 05:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
that any complaint will sound
 
05:38:35.230 --> 05:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
meritorious unless someone puts absolute
 
05:38:38.468 --> 05:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
gibberish on a page and submits it if
 
05:38:41.190 --> 05:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
you get no information from the accused
 
05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
a complaint will always sound legitimate
 
05:38:46.230 --> 05:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh now I'll give my example um the board
 
05:38:47.868 --> 05:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
might receive a complaint from someone
 
05:38:51.030 --> 05:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
that says I was recently denied at last
 
05:38:54.310 --> 05:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
week's annual meeting my most important
 
05:38:56.910 --> 05:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
in my most basic right as a condominium
 
05:38:59.708 --> 05:38:59.718 align:start position:0%
unit owner I was denied the ability to
 
05:39:02.468 --> 05:39:02.478 align:start position:0%
vote I went to the annual meeting I went
 
05:39:05.110 --> 05:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
there in person my Association refused
 
05:39:07.350 --> 05:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
to give me my ballot and as a result I
 
05:39:09.468 --> 05:39:09.478 align:start position:0%
was unable to
 
05:39:12.310 --> 05:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
vote on its own that sounds like a not
 
05:39:14.310 --> 05:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
only a legitimate meritorious complaint
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
but a serious one at that um what I can
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
tell you is that it's not uncommon for
 
05:39:22.708 --> 05:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
associations to have in their bylaws
 
05:39:25.390 --> 05:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
that um certain rights and privileges
 
05:39:28.468 --> 05:39:28.478 align:start position:0%
including voting at Association meetings
 
05:39:30.990 --> 05:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
are dependent of on a unit owner being
 
05:39:33.030 --> 05:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
in good standing with the
 
05:39:35.708 --> 05:39:35.718 align:start position:0%
community good standing is often defined
 
05:39:38.910 --> 05:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
as being both um in compliance with
 
05:39:40.910 --> 05:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the association's rules and
 
05:39:43.948 --> 05:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
restrictions are and up todate on
 
05:39:45.788 --> 05:39:45.798 align:start position:0%
whatever the unit's Financial
 
05:39:47.830 --> 05:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
Obligations are to the
 
05:39:50.910 --> 05:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
association and so in the example I just
 
05:39:54.590 --> 05:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
gave it sounds out of hand without any
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
information from the association like a
 
05:39:58.830 --> 05:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
very meritorious complaint but if the
 
05:39:58.840 --> 05:39:59.910 align:start position:0%
very meritorious complaint but if the
association

05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
association
 
05:40:01.830 --> 05:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
were allowed to provide some information
 
05:40:04.430 --> 05:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
and said our documents say you need to
 
05:40:06.548 --> 05:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
be in good standing this person that was
 
05:40:08.750 --> 05:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
denied the ability to vote hasn't paid a
 
05:40:11.990 --> 05:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
condominium fee in 14 months that's why
 
05:40:14.030 --> 05:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
they weren't able to vote it's all in
 
05:40:16.350 --> 05:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
our documents then that changes
 
05:40:19.150 --> 05:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
everything and so the point of that
 
05:40:21.150 --> 05:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
example is just to sort of highlight the
 
05:40:23.948 --> 05:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
importance of if such a board were to
 
05:40:27.110 --> 05:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
exist even if such a board were to only
 
05:40:29.110 --> 05:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
operate as a one-way Street meaning that
 
05:40:31.548 --> 05:40:31.558 align:start position:0%
they only accept complaints from unit
 
05:40:34.628 --> 05:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
owners and not from the association it
 
05:40:37.110 --> 05:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
still only makes sense
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
procedurally for this board to get some
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
form of input from the accused
 
05:40:45.670 --> 05:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
Association before they make any
 
05:40:47.670 --> 05:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
decisions even if it's a preliminary
 
05:40:49.430 --> 05:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
decision about the merits of the
 
05:40:52.110 --> 05:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
complaint I don't really know of another
 
05:40:55.070 --> 05:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
instance in any sort of legal or even
 
05:40:58.430 --> 05:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
pseudo legal setting where you have you
 
05:40:59.750 --> 05:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
know an accused
 
05:41:02.190 --> 05:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
and the accused and the accused provides
 
05:41:05.468 --> 05:41:05.478 align:start position:0%
no information um I know that they
 
05:41:08.548 --> 05:41:08.558 align:start position:0%
anticipate that happening later uh but
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
again it's problematic for all involved
 
05:41:12.788 --> 05:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
if this committee is reading you know
 
05:41:15.548 --> 05:41:15.558 align:start position:0%
complaints in a vacuum and deciding that
 
05:41:17.590 --> 05:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
everything has Merit and then everything
 
05:41:19.990 --> 05:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
that comes in goes forward and there's
 
05:41:21.310 --> 05:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of hearings before
 
05:41:23.830 --> 05:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
these boards I know associations we've
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
talked about board members um they're
 
05:41:28.788 --> 05:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
not going to appear without legal
 
05:41:30.670 --> 05:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
represent presentation they just won't
 
05:41:32.430 --> 05:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
do it they're volunteers they feel
 
05:41:35.468 --> 05:41:35.478 align:start position:0%
strained as it is um and they're not
 
05:41:37.070 --> 05:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
going to subject themselves to something
 
05:41:40.270 --> 05:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
like that so in terms of expense I don't
 
05:41:42.548 --> 05:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
think that there's necessarily a real
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
savings um it was mentioned that the fee
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
for this new board is anticipated to be
 
05:41:50.708 --> 05:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood of
 
05:41:55.468 --> 05:41:55.478 align:start position:0%
$250 um that is within 25 to $30 of the
 
05:41:59.628 --> 05:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
fee for filing a court case and if a
 
05:42:01.990 --> 05:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
unit owner wanted to file a case against
 
05:42:03.750 --> 05:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
their Association and represent
 
05:42:06.510 --> 05:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
themselves they are entitled to do that
 
05:42:08.670 --> 05:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
um and again if they got their attorney
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
and this a point that was made earlier
 
05:42:12.830 --> 05:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
in the day um but if a unit owner got an
 
05:42:16.070 --> 05:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
attorney went to court proved a case and
 
05:42:20.670 --> 05:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
one section 15 Roman numeral 2 would
 
05:42:23.390 --> 05:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
allow them to recover their legal costs
 
05:42:26.788 --> 05:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
so um you know all told we we just don't
 
05:42:29.310 --> 05:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
think there's that compelling uh of
 
05:42:31.390 --> 05:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
reason for the state to add government
 
05:42:34.510 --> 05:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
and add expense um if it does we would
 
05:42:36.030 --> 05:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
hope that it wouldn't be a one-way
 
05:42:38.708 --> 05:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
Street and uh again finally even if it
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
is a one-way Street we would hope um
 
05:42:43.030 --> 05:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
that this board would at least take some
 
05:42:45.750 --> 05:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
information in from the accused before
 
05:42:47.990 --> 05:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
anything else is done but generally
 
05:42:51.030 --> 05:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
speaking um I think a better approach
 
05:42:52.830 --> 05:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
for this legislature would be if
 
05:42:56.270 --> 05:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
anything uh to Simply put into the law
 
05:42:58.750 --> 05:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
that a dispute resolution process at the
 
05:43:01.628 --> 05:43:01.638 align:start position:0%
cond minum is something that needs to be
 
05:43:03.670 --> 05:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
in their
 
05:43:05.628 --> 05:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
bylaws all right thank you very much for
 
05:43:07.270 --> 05:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony representative Gibbs you
 
05:43:08.548 --> 05:43:08.558 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:43:12.150 --> 05:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you I do um and thank you
 
05:43:16.590 --> 05:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you refer to
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh preferring a an in-house uh dispute
 
05:43:25.030 --> 05:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
resolution system and you gave an
 
05:43:27.868 --> 05:43:27.878 align:start position:0%
example of a dispute between two
 
05:43:30.788 --> 05:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
neighbors but but if the dispute were in
 
05:43:35.468 --> 05:43:35.478 align:start position:0%
fact between the board and uh an
 
05:43:39.310 --> 05:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
individual unit owner but
 
05:43:43.430 --> 05:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
the complaint had to be resolved if the
 
05:43:45.150 --> 05:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
statute provided that the complaint had
 
05:43:49.070 --> 05:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
to be resolved in house wouldn't that be
 
05:43:51.430 --> 05:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
providing that the board would be
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to adjudicate complaints against
 
05:43:59.548 --> 05:43:59.558 align:start position:0%
itself um so potentially in the first
 
05:44:02.708 --> 05:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
instance um I do still think it matters
 
05:44:04.750 --> 05:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
because it does change the process in
 
05:44:07.070 --> 05:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
other words what we've heard here today
 
05:44:09.590 --> 05:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh from unit owners who have had issues
 
05:44:12.830 --> 05:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
um we've heard um repeatedly that the
 
05:44:14.110 --> 05:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
property management company doesn't
 
05:44:15.510 --> 05:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
listen to me they don't give me the time
 
05:44:18.390 --> 05:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
of day um the board they don't listen to
 
05:44:21.190 --> 05:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
me they don't give us the time of day so
 
05:44:23.590 --> 05:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
if the in-house process even if it just
 
05:44:26.190 --> 05:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
mandated that the board um have a
 
05:44:28.910 --> 05:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
meeting with the unit owner hear theit
 
05:44:31.868 --> 05:44:31.878 align:start position:0%
unit owner out on what their issues are
 
05:44:34.270 --> 05:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
um it would still be some form of
 
05:44:36.110 --> 05:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
forward progress because there would be
 
05:44:39.190 --> 05:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
more happening um than than what is
 
05:44:41.390 --> 05:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
happening right
 
05:44:44.310 --> 05:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
now forther question may inquire thank
 
05:44:47.590 --> 05:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
you um we've heard several discussions
 
05:44:50.230 --> 05:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
today about what happens if there's
 
05:44:52.070 --> 05:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
something in the statute and the board
 
05:44:54.310 --> 05:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
just doesn't do it what if it's in the
 
05:44:57.430 --> 05:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
statute and the board just doesn't do
 
05:44:59.548 --> 05:44:59.558 align:start position:0%
it so
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that question could be
 
05:45:05.590 --> 05:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
raised of anything I mean we have uh any
 
05:45:07.548 --> 05:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
number of laws in the state on both the
 
05:45:09.910 --> 05:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
Civil side and the criminal side and
 
05:45:11.830 --> 05:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
there are those people who choose to
 
05:45:14.750 --> 05:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
break those laws every single day um in
 
05:45:16.948 --> 05:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
in all kinds of areas regardless of what
 
05:45:19.910 --> 05:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
the law is and um you know we have what
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
we have we have a system of laws and we
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
have a system uh where we have the
 
05:45:27.030 --> 05:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
judicial uh courts in place uh for
 
05:45:29.750 --> 05:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
people to go to with their issues
 
05:45:33.030 --> 05:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
um you know when when we talk about any
 
05:45:35.670 --> 05:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
of these items that question sort of
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
remains in other words earlier today we
 
05:45:39.150 --> 05:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
were talking about a piece of
 
05:45:40.670 --> 05:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that said well the board
 
05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
should give minutes promptly and we had
 
05:45:45.788 --> 05:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
a discussion about the fact that the law
 
05:45:48.548 --> 05:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
already requires boards um to to give
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
minutes and the question became well
 
05:45:52.310 --> 05:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
what happens if the board doesn't follow
 
05:45:56.270 --> 05:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
that law well um if we passed the bill
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
that we were discussing today and we add
 
05:46:01.708 --> 05:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
added to the law an additional sentence
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
that said that uh meeting minutes must
 
05:46:05.430 --> 05:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
be provided
 
05:46:07.830 --> 05:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
promptly a board that's going to break
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
the law could just as easily break that
 
05:46:14.070 --> 05:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
law um as any other on the books and so
 
05:46:16.510 --> 05:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
I I think that we're not going to
 
05:46:19.310 --> 05:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
prevent regardless of of what statute
 
05:46:21.070 --> 05:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about or or what Bill
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about I don't think we can
 
05:46:26.390 --> 05:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
legislate our way into full compliance
 
05:46:27.788 --> 05:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
because there will always be those
 
05:46:29.310 --> 05:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
people who choose
 
05:46:31.948 --> 05:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
uh to to not follow the law or to break
 
05:46:35.110 --> 05:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
the law I think for those cases what we
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
have to rely on are are the recourses
 
05:46:39.230 --> 05:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
that exist in our
 
05:46:41.910 --> 05:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
system so representative Gibs you'll be
 
05:46:44.190 --> 05:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
happy to know the answer of this
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
question you just pose is about to be
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
answered thank you very much for your
 
05:46:52.948 --> 05:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
testimony you're welcome chair will call
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
on Kevin Sora from the Department of
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:47:13.590 align:start position:0%
on Kevin Sora from the Department of
Justice

05:47:13.590 --> 05:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:15.948 --> 05:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon sorry to keep you waiting
 
05:47:19.750 --> 05:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
oh no worries uh my name is Kevin scura
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
I'm an Assistant Attorney General in the
 
05:47:23.468 --> 05:47:23.478 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and antitrust Bureau
 
05:47:25.510 --> 05:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
over at the Department of Justice um I
 
05:47:27.150 --> 05:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that I'm not speaking
 
05:47:29.310 --> 05:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
either in favor or against
 
05:47:32.310 --> 05:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh the legislation um neither is my
 
05:47:34.030 --> 05:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
office nor the Attorney General taking a
 
05:47:35.948 --> 05:47:35.958 align:start position:0%
position on the legislation uh the
 
05:47:37.670 --> 05:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of the testimony today is simply
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
to to point out um a couple of potential
 
05:47:43.070 --> 05:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
technical issues that have the potential
 
05:47:45.150 --> 05:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
to cause confusion or or make it
 
05:47:46.548 --> 05:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
difficult for the bill to accomplish the
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
purposes that it sets out to
 
05:47:54.468 --> 05:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
accomplish um and some of this uh cover
 
05:47:55.910 --> 05:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
some of the ground that was addressed in
 
05:47:57.670 --> 05:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
the the amendment that was discussed a
 
05:48:01.430 --> 05:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
little earlier um and so I guess you
 
05:48:03.110 --> 05:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
know to some extent it may be um talking
 
05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
about the same same issues as as the
 
05:48:08.030 --> 05:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
amendment uh I think the first first
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
issue I'd like to talk about is uh the
 
05:48:12.670 --> 05:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
authority of the board um the current
 
05:48:14.468 --> 05:48:14.478 align:start position:0%
draft of the legislation you know before
 
05:48:16.510 --> 05:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment I think to some extent
 
05:48:19.868 --> 05:48:19.878 align:start position:0%
even after the amendment um doesn't uh
 
05:48:22.030 --> 05:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
address what types of relief that the
 
05:48:24.708 --> 05:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
board will be able to off off
 
05:48:27.468 --> 05:48:27.478 align:start position:0%
order um and so the you know the
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislation contemplates that the board
 
05:48:31.948 --> 05:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
might be able to um order order parties
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
to take actions in the amendment or you
 
05:48:35.990 --> 05:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
know before that to you know enter a
 
05:48:37.310 --> 05:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
decision that will go to the Superior
 
05:48:39.390 --> 05:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
Court it doesn't clarify what kinds of
 
05:48:42.948 --> 05:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
relief uh the board can can award um and
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
so you could you think about a court
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
that can or injunctive relief or damages
 
05:48:50.670 --> 05:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
or penalties or costs um and you know a
 
05:48:52.590 --> 05:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
board might wish to do any one of those
 
05:48:54.750 --> 05:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
things in in different cases but it's
 
05:48:56.990 --> 05:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
not clear from the current text of the
 
05:48:59.868 --> 05:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
draft uh whether has the power to do
 
05:49:03.070 --> 05:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
that and you know again I'm not taking a
 
05:49:04.390 --> 05:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
position on you know which of those
 
05:49:05.910 --> 05:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
Powers if any would be appropriate for
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
the board uh just pointing out that the
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
the current draft doesn't really specify
 
05:49:12.830 --> 05:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
which Powers it has uh which could lead
 
05:49:15.030 --> 05:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
to a challenge to any board
 
05:49:17.390 --> 05:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
action that that's
 
05:49:20.468 --> 05:49:20.478 align:start position:0%
taken um second you know the draft
 
05:49:23.628 --> 05:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
legislation leaves unclear uh you know
 
05:49:25.708 --> 05:49:25.718 align:start position:0%
what effect uh it has on the
 
05:49:27.390 --> 05:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the Consumer Protection
 
05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
Bureau um um the the the amendment
 
05:49:32.788 --> 05:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
addresses this issue with respect to the
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts um the the draft
 
05:49:37.910 --> 05:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislation before the amendment also
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
had a a question an open question of
 
05:49:42.030 --> 05:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
what the effect would be on the
 
05:49:44.190 --> 05:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the Superior Courts the
 
05:49:46.510 --> 05:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses that issue um but
 
05:49:48.990 --> 05:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
leaves the issue of you know what what
 
05:49:51.670 --> 05:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
effect it would have on the jurisdiction
 
05:49:54.190 --> 05:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
of the Consumer Protection Bureau um as
 
05:49:56.150 --> 05:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's in effect today the Condominium Act
 
05:49:57.830 --> 05:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
provides that the uh provisions of the
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
ACT shall be ad administered and
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
enforced by the consumer protection and
 
05:50:03.910 --> 05:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau um and the current
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
draft legislation states that the board
 
05:50:07.030 --> 05:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
can accept complaints against
 
05:50:07.040 --> 05:50:08.150 align:start position:0%
can accept complaints against
condominium

05:50:08.150 --> 05:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
condominium
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
associations uh that are forwarded by
 
05:50:11.350 --> 05:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Protection Bureau but
 
05:50:14.270 --> 05:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't clarify um what effect that
 
05:50:17.190 --> 05:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
forwarding mechanism would have on the
 
05:50:18.590 --> 05:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Protection Bureau whether
 
05:50:20.190 --> 05:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
the the bureau would be able to bring
 
05:50:22.230 --> 05:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
its own action if it if it saw fit to do
 
05:50:25.948 --> 05:50:25.958 align:start position:0%
that um and as currently drafted uh the
 
05:50:28.750 --> 05:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
legislation could lead to to challenges
 
05:50:32.830 --> 05:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
um to action by The Bureau um and the
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the outcome of a challenge like that
 
05:50:36.990 --> 05:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:41.310 --> 05:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
clear uh next you know the um draft
 
05:50:42.788 --> 05:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
legislation provides for a filing fee
 
05:50:44.310 --> 05:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
that will be required for complaints
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
that are filed with the board um and
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
also provides that the complaints can be
 
05:50:50.990 --> 05:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
forwarded from the bureau to the board
 
05:50:53.070 --> 05:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh but doesn't specify whether the
 
05:50:55.270 --> 05:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
filing fee would apply to the forwarded
 
05:50:57.990 --> 05:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
complaints who would be uh responsible
 
05:51:00.548 --> 05:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
for for paying it um so the committee is
 
05:51:02.270 --> 05:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
aware there's currently no fee to file a
 
05:51:03.468 --> 05:51:03.478 align:start position:0%
complaint with the consumer protection
 
05:51:06.628 --> 05:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
and antitrust Bureau uh and so if sort
 
05:51:08.310 --> 05:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
of left as it is it could create an
 
05:51:10.628 --> 05:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
incentive for unit owners to file
 
05:51:12.150 --> 05:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
complaints with the bureau in the hopes
 
05:51:14.468 --> 05:51:14.478 align:start position:0%
that they would be forwarded on to the
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
to the board uh and thereby avoid the
 
05:51:20.948 --> 05:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
filing fee um the draft legislation also
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
provides uh that you know people who are
 
05:51:25.150 --> 05:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
filing complaints have to give 10 days
 
05:51:27.030 --> 05:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
notice to the opposing party and that
 
05:51:28.910 --> 05:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
the board has a mechanism to you know
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
dismiss complaints if it finds the claim
 
05:51:33.430 --> 05:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
to be frivolous or without Merit um it's
 
05:51:35.548 --> 05:51:35.558 align:start position:0%
also not clear how those procedures
 
05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
would apply in the case of complaints
 
05:51:40.030 --> 05:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
that were forwarded from the bureau so
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
if the bureau got a complaint and
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
forwarded it to the board does the board
 
05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
still have the the power to uh dismiss
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
the complaint if it finds it frivolous
 
05:51:50.390 --> 05:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
or without Merit um also who is
 
05:51:52.230 --> 05:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing notice is it
 
05:51:54.868 --> 05:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
the the bureau or the complainant um in
 
05:51:55.910 --> 05:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
05:51:59.230 --> 05:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
forwarded uh complaints
 
05:52:03.708 --> 05:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
and sort of on the topic of of frivolous
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
um uh our Bureau receives complaints
 
05:52:08.708 --> 05:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
against Condominiums and many of those
 
05:52:12.310 --> 05:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
complaints involve uh disputes around
 
05:52:15.110 --> 05:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
things like access to documents uh or
 
05:52:17.230 --> 05:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
adherence to you know aesthetic rules of
 
05:52:19.468 --> 05:52:19.478 align:start position:0%
Condominiums like paint colors or yard
 
05:52:23.110 --> 05:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance and uh you know I'm not
 
05:52:24.468 --> 05:52:24.478 align:start position:0%
taking a position on whether those
 
05:52:27.670 --> 05:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
complaints are are frivolous or not um
 
05:52:29.548 --> 05:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
you know they may not have statewide
 
05:52:31.350 --> 05:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
impact they certainly do invoke strong
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
feelings uh you know one potential
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
benefit of a board like this may be that
 
05:52:37.270 --> 05:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
it could provide a form to resolve those
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
kinds of disputes but um the committee
 
05:52:41.150 --> 05:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
may wish to provide a little more
 
05:52:43.590 --> 05:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
guidance on what counts as a frivolous
 
05:52:47.390 --> 05:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
complaint um as it's considering the
 
05:52:47.400 --> 05:52:54.190 align:start position:0%
complaint um as it's considering the
legislation

05:52:54.190 --> 05:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:56.910 --> 05:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
um I had a note on the defined term
 
05:52:59.270 --> 05:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
usage which I I think uh the amendment
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
addressed about the distinction between
 
05:53:04.628 --> 05:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
condominium owners and condominium unit
 
05:53:08.628 --> 05:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
owners um next I wanted to note that the
 
05:53:10.510 --> 05:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
legislation the draft legislation
 
05:53:12.590 --> 05:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
selects two different parts of the
 
05:53:14.270 --> 05:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to serve roles in
 
05:53:16.750 --> 05:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
relationship to the board um which it
 
05:53:18.310 --> 05:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
requires the bureau chief for the
 
05:53:20.548 --> 05:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau to direct the
 
05:53:23.270 --> 05:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
board's rulemaking process and then uh
 
05:53:25.270 --> 05:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
requires the Civil Division to act as
 
05:53:27.548 --> 05:53:27.558 align:start position:0%
Council to the board uh there may be
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
good reasons to do that um but I did
 
05:53:31.030 --> 05:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
want to note that it would you know
 
05:53:33.670 --> 05:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
require sort of uh attorneys from
 
05:53:35.948 --> 05:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
different parts of the of the office to
 
05:53:39.830 --> 05:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
develop expertise in in the same area um
 
05:53:41.190 --> 05:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that leads into the final point I
 
05:53:43.670 --> 05:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
want to make which is uh the potential
 
05:53:46.110 --> 05:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of the legislation on the
 
05:53:48.910 --> 05:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of Justice this is
 
05:53:50.548 --> 05:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
covered in the department of Justice's
 
05:53:54.150 --> 05:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um but because it would
 
05:53:56.430 --> 05:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
require the bureau chief of the Consumer
 
05:53:58.708 --> 05:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau to act as to direct
 
05:54:00.230 --> 05:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
the board's rulemaking and the Civil
 
05:54:04.190 --> 05:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
Division to act as Council um it could
 
05:54:06.468 --> 05:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
you know require increased Staffing at
 
05:54:07.910 --> 05:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office depending
 
05:54:10.110 --> 05:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
on the length and complexity of the
 
05:54:13.030 --> 05:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and uh you know how
 
05:54:16.270 --> 05:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
many complaints uh the board receives
 
05:54:17.868 --> 05:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
and how much how involved that work
 
05:54:20.468 --> 05:54:20.478 align:start position:0%
winds up being uh which could affect the
 
05:54:21.868 --> 05:54:21.878 align:start position:0%
consumer escrow account and the general
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
fund but at this at this point without
 
05:54:25.390 --> 05:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
knowing how long those tasks will take
 
05:54:27.510 --> 05:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to estimate what the
 
05:54:31.030 --> 05:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of the bill would be um I
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for its time and I'm
 
05:54:34.750 --> 05:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions now represent
 
05:54:41.070 --> 05:54:41.080 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
05:54:44.310 --> 05:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh regarding the
 
05:54:47.310 --> 05:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that was provided um by the
 
05:54:47.320 --> 05:54:49.948 align:start position:0%
testimony that was provided um by the
previous

05:54:49.948 --> 05:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:54.230 --> 05:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
witness that it would be um Pro
 
05:54:56.548 --> 05:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
problematic if the board were to make a
 
05:54:58.670 --> 05:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
decision based only on information
 
05:55:01.390 --> 05:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
provided by the complainant considering
 
05:55:03.990 --> 05:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that the bill itself states
 
05:55:06.948 --> 05:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
that someone from the AG's office would
 
05:55:09.788 --> 05:55:09.798 align:start position:0%
would advise the board wouldn't that
 
05:55:12.150 --> 05:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
person from the AG's office advise the
 
05:55:15.150 --> 05:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
board that due process would require
 
05:55:17.190 --> 05:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
that the board in investigating a
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:23.948 --> 05:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
parties well I
 
05:55:26.750 --> 05:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can answer what sort of
 
05:55:28.750 --> 05:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional due process might require
 
05:55:30.910 --> 05:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
I you know recall that the bill sort of
 
05:55:33.548 --> 05:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
contemplates uh you know rulemaking
 
05:55:35.590 --> 05:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
which you know may address whether any
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
sort of procedures what the procedures
 
05:55:40.468 --> 05:55:40.478 align:start position:0%
may be in a sort of prehearing process
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh in a prehearing motions process which
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
may or may not I mean certainly that's
 
05:55:47.788 --> 05:55:47.798 align:start position:0%
where in many situations you do see um
 
05:55:50.750 --> 05:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for for response from an
 
05:55:53.708 --> 05:55:53.718 align:start position:0%
accused party further question me
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you just a follow-up
 
05:55:58.030 --> 05:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
question okay putting aside
 
05:56:01.390 --> 05:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues wouldn't General
 
05:56:03.670 --> 05:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you advise if you were advising
 
05:56:06.750 --> 05:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
the board on behalf of the AG's office
 
05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
that General fairness would require
 
05:56:11.948 --> 05:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
receiving information for both
 
05:56:14.510 --> 05:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
parties I mean certainly the the
 
05:56:16.830 --> 05:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
legislation as it it currently has has
 
05:56:16.840 --> 05:56:17.590 align:start position:0%
legislation as it it currently has has
been

05:56:17.590 --> 05:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:56:21.430 --> 05:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
drafted um contemplates a a hearing and
 
05:56:23.310 --> 05:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
I think the know talks about rulemaking
 
05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
which would talk about you know a
 
05:56:27.070 --> 05:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
pre-trial process and you know to me a
 
05:56:30.230 --> 05:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
pre-trial process would involve uh I
 
05:56:31.628 --> 05:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
mean in a court you'd call it a motion
 
05:56:33.628 --> 05:56:33.638 align:start position:0%
to dismiss I don't know you know what it
 
05:56:35.110 --> 05:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be called in this situation but
 
05:56:38.670 --> 05:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:42.230 --> 05:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
that you're all set so have you guys
 
05:56:43.750 --> 05:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
done rules
 
05:56:46.110 --> 05:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
before consumer protection Division I
 
05:56:48.150 --> 05:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
don't I don't remember the consumer
 
05:56:50.788 --> 05:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
protection division did uh draft the
 
05:56:52.910 --> 05:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
rules for the Condominium Act and for
 
05:56:55.628 --> 05:56:55.638 align:start position:0%
the land cell registration act when the
 
05:56:58.510 --> 05:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
orig the original rules and we we have
 
05:56:59.948 --> 05:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
to update them every 10 years in
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
accordance with the administrative
 
05:57:03.788 --> 05:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
procedure act but if someone were to
 
05:57:05.548 --> 05:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
call up with a complaint and say what
 
05:57:08.390 --> 05:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh what is you what are what
 
05:57:09.670 --> 05:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
can you do for
 
05:57:12.430 --> 05:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
me uh you know I I would say that
 
05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
consumer protection division is normally
 
05:57:16.030 --> 05:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
is to we try to make you whole you know
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
restitution and or uh or try to order
 
05:57:21.628 --> 05:57:21.638 align:start position:0%
the merchant or wherever it was to cease
 
05:57:23.590 --> 05:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
and toist well obviously you're not
 
05:57:25.350 --> 05:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to order a cease and toist here in
 
05:57:27.910 --> 05:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
this case or no way so what what exact
 
05:57:31.070 --> 05:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
actly could you do to help a consumer uh
 
05:57:33.310 --> 05:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
get this case resolved even if without
 
05:57:36.548 --> 05:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
this statute on the boat
 
05:57:39.150 --> 05:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
so um at the Consumer Protection Bureau
 
05:57:40.708 --> 05:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
we receive complaints against all kinds
 
05:57:42.350 --> 05:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
of businesses including condominium
 
05:57:45.150 --> 05:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
associations right um you know every
 
05:57:46.510 --> 05:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
written complaint that we receive in
 
05:57:51.110 --> 05:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
attorney reviews uh we ask the uh
 
05:57:53.190 --> 05:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
consumer for the permission to send the
 
05:57:55.270 --> 05:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
complaint to the business assuming they
 
05:57:56.750 --> 05:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
Grant it we send the complaint to the to
 
05:57:58.830 --> 05:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
the business and get their resp response
 
05:58:00.070 --> 05:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and then from there we make a
 
05:58:02.670 --> 05:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
decision about you know sometimes a
 
05:58:03.788 --> 05:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
letter on the Attorney General's
 
05:58:08.030 --> 05:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
letterhead uh can uh resolve it can
 
05:58:09.788 --> 05:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
resolve the situation sometimes it
 
05:58:12.270 --> 05:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't um and you know we make a
 
05:58:14.548 --> 05:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
decision then about whether to pursue an
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
investigation or possible litigation
 
05:58:19.310 --> 05:58:19.320 align:start position:0%

um just want to understand uh why this
 
05:59:04.030 --> 05:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
makes sense under the office of
 
05:59:04.040 --> 05:59:05.110 align:start position:0%
makes sense under the office of
professional

05:59:05.110 --> 05:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
professional
 
05:59:08.910 --> 05:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
lenser uh I see that their fiscal note
 
05:59:11.190 --> 05:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh was the the
 
05:59:14.750 --> 05:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
largest um and uh near the end of the
 
05:59:16.590 --> 05:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
bill it says uh the office of
 
05:59:18.350 --> 05:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
professional lure and
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
certification the administration of the
 
05:59:23.510 --> 05:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
condominium dispute resolution board is
 
05:59:26.510 --> 05:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh inserted under their Authority so if
 
05:59:28.110 --> 05:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
you have any any thoughts on that would
 
05:59:31.110 --> 05:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:34.468 --> 05:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
share um I I was not aware of that until
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
I got to the hearing today um I'm not
 
05:59:39.670 --> 05:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain why why it would be that
 
05:59:41.868 --> 05:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
way I mean I you know the Condominium
 
05:59:44.468 --> 05:59:44.478 align:start position:0%
Act uh assigns to the Consumer
 
05:59:46.910 --> 05:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau the the authority and
 
05:59:50.150 --> 05:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
I guess duty to enforce the the Act and
 
05:59:51.750 --> 05:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of resolving disputes
 
05:59:52.910 --> 05:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
about it to
 
05:59:56.510 --> 05:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
the uh Superior Courts um so I'm I'm not
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure what role the the oplc would play
 
06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:01.680 align:start position:0%

board I wouldn't have to be here um
 
06:00:58.030 --> 06:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
because as you've heard
 
06:00:59.910 --> 06:00:59.920 align:start position:0%

annual meeting and vote and because they
 
06:01:17.190 --> 06:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
weren't in good standing there could be
 
06:01:20.310 --> 06:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
you know a questioner that you know
 
06:01:22.350 --> 06:01:22.360 align:start position:0%

06:01:47.230 --> 06:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
number um you know is there going to be
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
a lot or less um you know why these
 
06:01:52.708 --> 06:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
things can be Revisited in a yearly
 
06:01:54.990 --> 06:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
basis you know if there's more or less
 
06:01:58.430 --> 06:01:58.440 align:start position:0%

Ambassador

06:03:43.350 --> 06:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:45.548 --> 06:03:45.558 align:start position:0%
I've been up here before so I will not
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
introduce myself dick sweat straight of
 
06:03:52.190 --> 06:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on uh HB 1645
 
06:03:55.230 --> 06:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
FN uh the condominium Leadership Council
 
06:03:56.750 --> 06:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
and the vineyard board of directors
 
06:03:58.868 --> 06:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill for the following
 
06:04:02.708 --> 06:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
reasons RSA 356 b35 States the
 
06:04:05.030 --> 06:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
condominium bylaws were to be written
 
06:04:07.548 --> 06:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
providing for the self-government of the
 
06:04:10.190 --> 06:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
condominium by an association of unit
 
06:04:13.788 --> 06:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
owners HB 1645 would allow a unit owner
 
06:04:16.150 --> 06:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
to petition the dispute board directly
 
06:04:18.390 --> 06:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
and not follow any complaint procedures
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the association's bylaws
 
06:04:24.628 --> 06:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
HB 1645 is contrary to the principle of
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
an association's right of
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
self-government the appointed dispute
 
06:04:29.948 --> 06:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
board would substitute the wisdom of
 
06:04:32.430 --> 06:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
elected Association boards who have a
 
06:04:34.948 --> 06:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
vested interest in their Association is
 
06:04:37.708 --> 06:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
compared to appointed Outsiders who
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
really don't have any knowledge of a
 
06:04:44.230 --> 06:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
specific Condominium Association HB 1645
 
06:04:46.030 --> 06:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
provides for final Relief by the appeals
 
06:04:48.510 --> 06:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
to the Superior Court this is the same
 
06:04:50.070 --> 06:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
court that would decide a case without
 
06:04:52.510 --> 06:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
the burdens and expense required by
 
06:04:55.830 --> 06:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
appearing before the resolution board HB
 
06:04:58.230 --> 06:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
1645 will provide the resolution of
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
disputes and will add an unnecessary lay
 
06:05:03.990 --> 06:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh layer of legal processes and what
 
06:05:06.390 --> 06:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
penales can the dispute board levy on a
 
06:05:08.070 --> 06:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
party who does not comply with the
 
06:05:08.080 --> 06:05:09.030 align:start position:0%
party who does not comply with the
dispute

06:05:09.030 --> 06:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
06:05:12.350 --> 06:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
board's decision if canding owners are
 
06:05:13.750 --> 06:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
not happy with the elected board's
 
06:05:15.868 --> 06:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
governance and management practices the
 
06:05:18.230 --> 06:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
remedy is for the owners to participate
 
06:05:20.430 --> 06:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
in the association's governance by being
 
06:05:22.910 --> 06:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
elected to the association's board of
 
06:05:28.270 --> 06:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
directors paragraph 356 b73 parag 3C
 
06:05:31.510 --> 06:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
statement that this is the statement
 
06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:37.708 --> 06:05:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh issue we're looking at here the
 
06:05:39.910 --> 06:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
statement says the board meaning the
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
dispute board shall not be bound by
 
06:05:46.390 --> 06:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
common law or Stat statutory Rules of
 
06:05:49.430 --> 06:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
Evidence but may admit all testimony
 
06:05:52.750 --> 06:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
having a reasonable probative value and
 
06:05:55.230 --> 06:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
this to me is a description of an
 
06:05:58.110 --> 06:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
autocratic Tribunal the office of
 
06:06:00.270 --> 06:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
professional lure and certification will
 
06:06:02.990 --> 06:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
oversee the dispute board for the uh
 
06:06:06.230 --> 06:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
oplc to fulfill its duties under H
 
06:06:10.350 --> 06:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
1645 the estimated cost is
 
06:06:12.628 --> 06:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
$374,000 I would also point out that
 
06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
this uh uh board is modeled after the
 
06:06:19.750 --> 06:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board and if you go
 
06:06:22.590 --> 06:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
to the manufactured housing board uh
 
06:06:25.628 --> 06:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
they do have a website and you can look
 
06:06:29.270 --> 06:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
at their meeting and board and agendas
 
06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
and they only they only have two years
 
06:06:32.320 --> 06:06:33.948 align:start position:0%
and they only they only have two years
up

06:06:33.948 --> 06:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:06:36.350 --> 06:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
2021 they
 
06:06:39.628 --> 06:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
had gee I don't know maybe four hearings
 
06:06:41.390 --> 06:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
and I think they were like preliminary
 
06:06:43.310 --> 06:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
hearings and they might have had one
 
06:06:46.750 --> 06:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
actual resolution hearing and in
 
06:06:49.910 --> 06:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
2022 I don't think they had any hearings
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I think they might have one or maybe
 
06:06:55.468 --> 06:06:55.478 align:start position:0%
one and in 2023 there were no posting
 
06:06:58.910 --> 06:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so I don't know how many
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
manufactured housings are around here
 
06:07:03.510 --> 06:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
but the percentage of those folks
 
06:07:05.670 --> 06:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
availing themselves of that dispute
 
06:07:07.548 --> 06:07:07.558 align:start position:0%
board is
 
06:07:07.558 --> 06:07:09.190 align:start position:0%
board is
minimal

06:07:09.190 --> 06:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
06:07:12.390 --> 06:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
um we actually repealed it P pardon
 
06:07:14.190 --> 06:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
we've repealed that it's doesn't exist
 
06:07:16.390 --> 06:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
anymore it doesn't it doesn't even exist
 
06:07:19.150 --> 06:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
anymore no and the reason it doesn't
 
06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
exist uh that's well I'll tell you
 
06:07:24.750 --> 06:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
offline okay well I just kind of curious
 
06:07:27.788 --> 06:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
you know that's it's important
 
06:07:35.628 --> 06:07:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:35.638 --> 06:07:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
see

06:07:39.830 --> 06:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:44.628 --> 06:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
well I I would say in this resolution
 
06:07:47.548 --> 06:07:47.558 align:start position:0%
here it basically does say that the
 
06:07:51.070 --> 06:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney General will represent this
 
06:07:55.070 --> 06:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
board that would mean to me that anybody
 
06:07:57.390 --> 06:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
who comes before this board is probably
 
06:08:00.910 --> 06:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
also going to have an attorney pres so
 
06:08:02.468 --> 06:08:02.478 align:start position:0%
no matter whether you're going before
 
06:08:04.670 --> 06:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
this board and have any attorneys or you
 
06:08:06.830 --> 06:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
go to the Superior Court where the final
 
06:08:08.868 --> 06:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
resolution is going to be anyway you're
 
06:08:10.868 --> 06:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
going to be dealing with
 
06:08:13.468 --> 06:08:13.478 align:start position:0%
attorneys well I think that's really all
 
06:08:15.510 --> 06:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
I have I will say that these are all
 
06:08:19.070 --> 06:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with civil penalties uh
 
06:08:20.830 --> 06:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
certainly if they're criminal penalties
 
06:08:22.830 --> 06:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a different can of
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
worms but these are all civil penalties
 
06:08:36.670 --> 06:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:40.510 --> 06:08:40.520 align:start position:0%

06:09:16.350 --> 06:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications right right and all you
 
06:09:17.750 --> 06:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
have to do is be willing to work for 100
 
06:09:19.948 --> 06:09:19.958 align:start position:0%
bucks a
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:25.718 --> 06:09:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
word

06:09:31.070 --> 06:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:32.670 --> 06:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
so you've heard from me before Ashley
 
06:09:35.868 --> 06:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
ten from marac New Hampshire um this is
 
06:09:38.190 --> 06:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
probably the fifth or sixth time that
 
06:09:41.628 --> 06:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
this bill has come up before you guys in
 
06:09:43.510 --> 06:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
multiple different drafts and in
 
06:09:47.548 --> 06:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple different ways um and
 
06:09:50.350 --> 06:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
if it's continuing to come up then cases
 
06:09:52.990 --> 06:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
are continuing to come to the committee
 
06:09:55.590 --> 06:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
um that writes these up and if that's
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
happening then there is definitely a
 
06:10:01.430 --> 06:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
need for this um you
 
06:10:01.440 --> 06:10:03.310 align:start position:0%
need for this um you
know

06:10:03.310 --> 06:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:10:05.750 --> 06:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
if if I didn't do some Googling I
 
06:10:07.628 --> 06:10:07.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even have known about the
 
06:10:11.628 --> 06:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
committee and it's not easy to find you
 
06:10:14.070 --> 06:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
there is no thing out there that just
 
06:10:16.230 --> 06:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
says hey if you're having an issue with
 
06:10:19.468 --> 06:10:19.478 align:start position:0%
your condo go here take a look at this
 
06:10:22.190 --> 06:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
everything is go to your board so you go
 
06:10:24.030 --> 06:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
to your board you don't get any
 
06:10:26.190 --> 06:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
resolution you go to your management
 
06:10:28.150 --> 06:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
company they say go to your board you
 
06:10:29.230 --> 06:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
don't get any
 
06:10:31.510 --> 06:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
resolution then you go to the Attorney
 
06:10:34.070 --> 06:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
General's office you fill out a
 
06:10:36.708 --> 06:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
form months go by you don't hear
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
anything you call oh yeah we received
 
06:10:42.788 --> 06:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
your form we're not sure how we're going
 
06:10:44.948 --> 06:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
to handle that because we don't have the
 
06:10:47.230 --> 06:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
staff it's just it's an over and over
 
06:10:48.670 --> 06:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
thing and then you eventually just get
 
06:10:51.230 --> 06:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
told either by your association's lawyer
 
06:10:53.190 --> 06:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
or your management company or your board
 
06:10:56.350 --> 06:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
itself you know what you want this fixed
 
06:10:56.360 --> 06:10:57.310 align:start position:0%
itself you know what you want this fixed
soon

06:10:57.310 --> 06:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
soon
 
06:11:01.270 --> 06:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
us so then you're spending your money
 
06:11:04.670 --> 06:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
and it's anywhere from $6 to $122,000
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
for a
 
06:11:08.468 --> 06:11:08.478 align:start position:0%
retainer I'm sorry but I don't know of a
 
06:11:10.590 --> 06:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
whole lot of people that are living in
 
06:11:13.590 --> 06:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
condos that have $6 to $12,000 to put
 
06:11:16.788 --> 06:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
down for a retainer to go to a lawyer to
 
06:11:19.030 --> 06:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
then take time out to go to court to
 
06:11:20.948 --> 06:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
then hopefully be able to get that money
 
06:11:25.150 --> 06:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
back this dispute board will cut all of
 
06:11:28.150 --> 06:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
that um and there's definitely a need
 
06:11:30.430 --> 06:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
there are rogue Boards out there I would
 
06:11:33.110 --> 06:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
love to find a place that has a good
 
06:11:35.628 --> 06:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
board that follows every single law and
 
06:11:38.270 --> 06:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
if we went through the whole process of
 
06:11:40.590 --> 06:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
well why are we going to build this
 
06:11:42.190 --> 06:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
board why are we going to do these laws
 
06:11:43.868 --> 06:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
if you know they're not going to be
 
06:11:46.590 --> 06:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
followed well why do we pass any law if
 
06:11:47.910 --> 06:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be followed there are
 
06:11:50.670 --> 06:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
criminals everywhere and we continue to
 
06:11:52.868 --> 06:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
pass laws and we continue to have courts
 
06:11:56.030 --> 06:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
that hear that but for condos it's
 
06:11:58.390 --> 06:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
different you go to your board and then
 
06:12:00.788 --> 06:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
you're told to sue them you don't want
 
06:12:02.468 --> 06:12:02.478 align:start position:0%
to sue the place that you live you want
 
06:12:04.708 --> 06:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
to be able to enjoy the place you live
 
06:12:06.468 --> 06:12:06.478 align:start position:0%
having a dispute board to be able to go
 
06:12:09.150 --> 06:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
to hear this without having to go to
 
06:12:11.468 --> 06:12:11.478 align:start position:0%
court or take money out or try and get a
 
06:12:14.548 --> 06:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
lawyer that you know as you just saw
 
06:12:17.190 --> 06:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
earlier today it's not easy to find a
 
06:12:18.830 --> 06:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer that's going to do
 
06:12:21.548 --> 06:12:21.558 align:start position:0%
this um you know and I appreciate you
 
06:12:24.628 --> 06:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
getting us those names but it's still
 
06:12:27.548 --> 06:12:27.558 align:start position:0%
it's not easy for a homeowner owner to
 
06:12:30.310 --> 06:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
bring up a complaint against the board
 
06:12:32.270 --> 06:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying that as a former board
 
06:12:35.510 --> 06:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
member and as a homeowner you know we
 
06:12:37.548 --> 06:12:37.558 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of homeowner complaints some
 
06:12:41.150 --> 06:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
of them are homeowner versus homeowner
 
06:12:43.230 --> 06:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
some of them are people not happy with
 
06:12:44.910 --> 06:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
the management company some of them are
 
06:12:47.788 --> 06:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
people not happy with the other board
 
06:12:50.150 --> 06:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
but unless you've got something that's
 
06:12:51.948 --> 06:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
going to mitigate that and be that
 
06:12:54.708 --> 06:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
middle person almost like a
 
06:12:56.868 --> 06:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
mediator um type thing
 
06:12:59.070 --> 06:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get anywhere and
 
06:13:00.510 --> 06:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
like I said the fact that this is
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
continuing to come up and that people
 
06:13:04.750 --> 06:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
are continuing to go to this committee
 
06:13:07.190 --> 06:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
to say that there are issues with the
 
06:13:08.948 --> 06:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
laws or that there's issues with their
 
06:13:11.150 --> 06:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
boards and that boards are not following
 
06:13:12.830 --> 06:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
this law and that we are following the
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
due process of going to our board our
 
06:13:18.030 --> 06:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
management company the AG's office and
 
06:13:20.030 --> 06:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
then having to try and find a lawyer
 
06:13:21.868 --> 06:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
just the fact that they're continuing to
 
06:13:24.030 --> 06:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
hear this and that this Bo this bill
 
06:13:26.350 --> 06:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
keeps coming before you guys there's an
 
06:13:28.910 --> 06:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
issue here and it needs to be addressed
 
06:13:28.920 --> 06:13:30.990 align:start position:0%
issue here and it needs to be addressed

the public
 
06:13:46.230 --> 06:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
hearing and stay tuned for the
 
06:13:48.030 --> 06:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I think this this is an
 
06:13:50.510 --> 06:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
early bill so we will be subbing this
 
06:13:50.520 --> 06:13:51.910 align:start position:0%
early bill so we will be subbing this
fairly

06:13:51.910 --> 06:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
06:13:51.920 --> 06:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
fairly
