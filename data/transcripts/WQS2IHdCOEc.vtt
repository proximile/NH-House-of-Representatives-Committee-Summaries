00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
bill as as being something it's a
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
feel-good bill if we do it that's good
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
and it may help if we don't do it I
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
think you know I don't think there's

anything lost um I I think it would be a
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
good thing to do it doesn't cost any
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
money and if we can find three people
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
that are willing to participate do it
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
all right so we got in versus doing an
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
understand what it says because it it's
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
I've never seen more gobbly G in a in an
 
00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:12.670 align:start position:0%
I've never seen more gobbly G in a in an
amendment

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.309 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
ah yeah the it's the RSA that was the
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
other problem with this bill was the RSA
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
354 the first bunch of lines all the way
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
until you get to 12 stay exactly as they
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
were what this is saying is that b is
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
taking out it's just changing section
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
um well this is not exactly what you had
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
described to me it's what I was trying
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
to get to I hear you and and now you see
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
in live in In Living Color why we we do
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment so here's we can do a floor
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment we can do a Flor am so uh
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
let's do the inter room study motion now
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to do an not to
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
pass motion so I'm just I'm saying right
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
now we were we were talking about itl so
 
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just suggesting that we do an
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
interim study motion and you and I can
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
work and then we can see if we can find
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
something that that we can El that gets
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
to what you're trying to
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
do okay and what you are trying to do is
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
you want to make it just like the
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
vasectomy are you saying that it's not
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
possible to do that today at this moment
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
no I mean to ask this wait no I I don't
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
want to stick I don't want to stick I
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
mean I I not withstanding I will
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
disappoint all those board members in my
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
library that I don't show up but that
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
for us to then get this amendment you
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
this this is the pro why we have
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we go to subcommittees we
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
work these things out we get these
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
things structured right and then we
 
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
bring then once we know we've got it
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
right I understand all that so all I'm
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
just saying is I am certainly willing to
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
help you to see if we can do something
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
differently and it conceivably it could
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
end up being a floor Amendment and it
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely could be a floor Amendment if
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
we can find something we can agree on
 
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
all right all right we have that
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
recorded it's on
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
YouTube there
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
forever okay could could representative
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
spear tell us exactly what you're trying
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
to do I I'm a little bit
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
confused what I want the way I want this
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
to end up or the way I'm hoping it ends
 
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
up is that whether the uh any person any
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
person with a
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
uterus whether they are
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
heterosexual bisexual whatever they are
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
whatever they are they are entitled to
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
six rounds per year of
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
IUI and it's not considered infertility
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
I read through the laws on infertility
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
and they have a very fuzzy outline and
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
this fits right above that is the 417 G1
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
is that the treatment the IV what is it
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
IUI IU you want IUI can it be ivi Oh you
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
mean IV over there
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
IVF which one are you talking about what
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
what is the actual treatment IUI I'm
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
looking now at the department what is
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
I I believe the bill that in its current
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
form without an amendment is relating to
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
IUI right which is one very specific
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
treatment and it's allowing up to six
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
rounds of IUI per plan year right
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we want but then there's all
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
this other stuff in in the down well
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
because the chapter relates to
 
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
infertility this mandate to require
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
coverage for IUI is absent a diagnosis
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
of infertility so you can get these six
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
rounds of IUI whether you've been
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with any woman regardless of
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
their status yes without a diagnosis of
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
INF without a diagnosis of infertility
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's section one of the bill
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's the chapter that exists what the
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
bill would change is putting in this IUI
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
and that is absent a finding of
 
00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
infertility everyone has access to that
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
if you have a finding of but wasn't
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
there another section in that bill that
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
had all these labor stuff on it yes
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment is ADD so if
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
bill well yeah one and
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
two one and two is the short title and
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
what it changed
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
section I believe that you're that's
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for so two sections one
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
and two so two just simply says that any
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
it but it does have that infertility
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
statement in regardless of infertility
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
it says in there right yes so you don't
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
have to have a diagnosis of infertility
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to access this specific
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
treatment right everything else in the
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
chapter you have to have a diagnosis of
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
infertility that sounds good and so if
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
we just pass one and two and then I
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
guess we uh delete that but we still
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
need the effect date of January 1
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes okay well it could be 60 days
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
because this is for a large group right
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
section oh yeah that's got to be January
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
1 January 1 would be better yeah section
 
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.109 align:start position:0%
1 January 1 would be better yeah section
one

00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
is monitoring economy act where did the
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
hell that come from January 1st no
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
modern economy act I don't know where
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
that came from I thought that meant
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
something to you like like solely was
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
that what this bill originally was and
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
then they gutted it and put something
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
else in it sorry what was section one of
 
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
the B oh it had to do with the other
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
stuff it just it'll get it'll get
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
theoretical get retitled I guess yeah
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
this bill originally started as
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
something much more ambitious and this
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
is what has been whittel down to so
 
00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:14.839 align:start position:0%
initially included stuff like IVF that's
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
why it's up in the the higher title the
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
ACT um but that has gone through many
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
revisions with the stakeholders there
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
still way we could do it today I I no
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
because it's it it's let's we'll do a
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment okay we'll do a floor
 
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
then let's not vote on it right now no
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
no we have to vote we have to do it m Mr
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
chairman yes if we took a vote to OTP
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
and I know there are a number of flaws
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
in here knowing that a floor Amendment
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
will be coming up and if your side
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
decides to vote against it and our side
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
decides to go for it it's going to come
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
up with no recommendation and then it
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
can go to the floor and we can do
 
00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:50.839 align:start position:0%
whatever we want to do no we don't want
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
to do that we don't we're gonna have an
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
amendment we're gonna have a debate
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
anyway well I no not necessarily
 
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
not necessarily because if we if we have
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
an understanding what we're what she
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
wants to get at which was the the
 
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
original t not the original the one
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph here and uh and we and
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
obviously we need to change the title
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we need to change the effective date
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh we there's some things that need to
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
be changed well the effective date has
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
changed all right because the amendment
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
has that okay I'm just saying is we want
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
to clean up but in interim study means
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the bill will always if if if
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
something bad were to happen on the
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
floor when we try to do something at at
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
least that the pending motion from this
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee is interim study we can work
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
on and get it done right but I was just
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
saying is for that if we just do that
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
and yes I am certainly committed to
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
working to try to get you an amendment
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
that that I could live with and I can't
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
speak for all the Republicans in the
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
committee but I'm I'm pretty sure well I
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
know I don't have some votes but I'm I'm
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
just concerned this bill taking another
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
year to get passed that's the thing and
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
I think this is important enough that we
 
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
need to get it passed now and I fear if
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
you put an inm study motion on the floor
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
regardless if we we have Amendment or
 
00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
not there's a chance it could get passed
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
which delays this bill for another year
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
and it's just the same thing as it
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
telling it so that's why I would rather
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
see an OTP go to the floor than an I
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
don't see the UR I don't see the urgency
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill look why don't we ask
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
Kristen how long would it take her to
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
just add to take out one more paragraph
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
Just you we're no can't have it done by
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
noon why not I don't understand to have
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
this amendment done by noon I had it
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
done in an hour to begin with that's how
 
00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:35.559 align:start position:0%
I came in this morning early and they
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
depend on whether you have a library
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
meaning I'm
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
sorry okay yes represent Ammon I I just
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative spear could you explain
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
can you speak a little louder I'm having
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of trouble representative could
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
you could you explain the amendment
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
because what I read here it's unlawful
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination fertility treatment but
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
then it it and then it exempts fertility
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
from the amendment that's the way it
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
me yeah what we just discussed was to
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
take out section three add that to the
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
part that was taken out so that all that
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
would be left would be one and
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
two don't do this amend I'm sorry no the
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
amendment isn't going to work because we
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
need to take out more than what was in
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
there and the part that you're talking
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
about needs to come out why don't we
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
just take a vote and then we'll vote on
 
00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:27.559 align:start position:0%
what what are we voting on oh because we
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
can't we're voting on letting people
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
have right no but but we probably in all
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
in all due respect
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
repres my honor here my word here is
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
that I absolutely worked I've already I
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
I I agreed intent on what was proposed
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
all right so and then all I'm asking is
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
just do the interation now I will be the
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
one who gets up there and tell everybody
 
00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
no on the inter room study and then I
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
introduce the new Amendment okay okay
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
all right that's the deal I think that's
 
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
fair you I I think John's not a bad
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
actor he's not a bad faith actor when it
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
comes so what we're aiming for is a
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment and you're going to help
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
me write it just can I just say
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
something can you please include the
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
ranking members when you put this
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
together that's all absolutely it would
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
not be just her okay of course not of
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
course not I think that's a good move
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
for the record if we were to get in any
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
committee conferences or any of these
 
00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
discussions and we do have two um uh
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
concurrences right now I will always
 
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.670 align:start position:0%
concurrences right now I will always
include

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
you representative bars always okay is
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
tonight okay all right excuse me
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
no all yeah just before you do anything
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
else think you need to take us out of
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
recess I know I know do but I just want
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
to make clear what we're going to where
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
we are could you just summarize what
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
exactly okay so the expectation is that
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
we will uh pass the inter room study
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
motion uh and then we will work on
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
trying to create an amendment that will
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely be distributed to all the
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee so that you can
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
explain to your
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
seatmates how this committee that never
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
had a bill on the regular calendar is
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
now suddenly going to have one uh
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
because we knew that this floor
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
amendment was coming and that uh this
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
that that you know they certainly are
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
free to vote whatever they want to fruit
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
but that the committee um is committed
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
to at least bringing forward this other
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment and and and and you're going
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
to speak to it and say how wonderful it
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
is speak and I'm going to say that it is
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
a perfect Amendment for women
 
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
empowerment I heard you say it that word
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
please do
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
I got to say something else okay yes
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
okay I just need to say this because you
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
talked about women empowerment and I
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
this is not an attack on you
 
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
because don't wor no no it isn't it
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
isn't John it isn't Mr chair but I guess
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has my hackles up
 
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
is that and one of the reason this bill
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
is so important to many people in this
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
committee is that the speaker of the
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
house uh it was supposed to be a nice
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
Mother's Day uh declaration came out
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
with a declaration saying that it's um
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
national natural family month and if you
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
go on to look at the wording behind the
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
foundation that put it out it said that
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
there has to be a male male head of the
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
household so that's one reason some of
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
us have our hackles up right now about a
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill that involves uh same seex
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
couples but not justes same this this
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
bill it says but it will help get
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
pregnant it help samex couples it's but
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's not just same seex couples come on
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's I've been the head of my
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
household forever my husband wouldn't
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
word all right it represented
 
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.970 align:start position:0%
word all right it represented
faction

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
faction
 
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.150 align:start position:0%
faction
[Laughter]

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]

fully working it out I appreciate the
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
effort of this committee and this this
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
bill basically in no way involves me
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
personally but uh good to know um you
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
wicked important to some people and
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
maybe not important to other people but
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
to those people who it's important to
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
important everybody's better off if we

take a deep breath and go down this road
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
of let's put together the amendment
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's really right right because when
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%

I we already did it okay but you will do
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
great so basically the original bill um

01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh which will then but the the repeal
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
was going to be as of as of I think July
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
1st so uh it's going to repal the
 
01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
repeal and which is section one of this
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
amendment and then section two is that
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
the new the new law will take in

favor placing on the consent Calendar
 
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
please say I I who's opposed so moved
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
unanimously okay uh I have two Committee
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
of conferences here so for your new new
 
01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
members uh I'm not I'm sure we must I
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
don't remember what happened last year
 
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
but so um when a bill that we have sent
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate gets amended by the
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
Senate it then comes back
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh for us to for
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
concurrence and uh on my sheet now
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
because the the chair actually makes the
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
motion few things that the chair has has
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
some control over and um in which that
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh either concur non-c concur or
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
non-c Concur and request a committee of
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
conference and at that point if if
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's the motion you uh the we have the
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
house has four
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
appointees and the first requirement of
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
the appointees is that theoretically
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
they had voted for the house bill in
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
session on on session day so that that
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
is documented that they have uh on the
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
floor now if you know in terms of if it
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't if there wasn't a voice if it was
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote or a non-vote I mean
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
theoretically um they could go back to
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
the committee as a chairman I would go
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
back to the committee vote and see what
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
was the vote and see so the reason I say
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
that is because you theoretically would
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
have three Republicans and one Democrat
 
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
um and so therefore the issue is whether
 
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
that one Democrat could you just explain
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
the the breakdown three Republicans why
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
just just want I just want to understand
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
why it's three and
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
one uh it's basic it's actually in our
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
rules it's written into our rules that
 
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's the way the breakdown is three
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
depending on who's in majority it
 
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
depending on the major decided it was
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to be three in one so if if you
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
know if if you were in the
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
chair it would mean
 
01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.270 align:start position:0%
chair it would mean
when

01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
c three it would three Democrats and one
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
Republican okay just and and just I'm
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
sorry this and is it also true with a
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee that there doesn't have to be
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan breakdown the committee we
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
just did for the ecigarettes so the the
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee this has nothing to do with I
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
understand that that committee yeah that
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
that committee they you always try to
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
have one person on the minority party
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
they don't state it but that yes the
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
depends who's who's The Speaker okay got
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
it it depends on the speaker you want to
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
throw me under the bus again
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
no no I said the speaker you want to
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
throw him on the bus again speaker you
 
01:23:17.709 --> 01:23:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so um so so they will now take
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
them up I have first one was um the cond
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
the Condominium Association and I
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
believe I sent everybody out you got the
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
side by sides and there's anybody have
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
any any questions or any feelings about
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
how they basically says the same thing
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
it just they rewrote it in another way
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
to thetically to make it easier for the
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
condo association to understand what
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
what's happening so does anybody have a
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
problem with that otherwise I will
 
01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:50.950 align:start position:0%
problem with that otherwise I will
concur

01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
concur
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
Concur and and I initial it
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
okay the other one is a liquor
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
one and this is uh our famous increasing
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
the penalties for on- premise lienes for
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
over serving alcohol um in this case
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
there is the motion would actually be
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
made by two chairs because after the
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
bill left us it then went over to
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
criminal justice uh so uh representative
 
01:24:19.229 --> 01:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
Roy would also have the opportunity to
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
sign off um I I pointed out to him that
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
this particular Amendment
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
which was deleting um a penalty for the
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
second Offense for a minum and I said
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's really up more up your alley than
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
ours because that's a
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
criminal so I I said I was I would lean
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
to his opinion he was okay with it and
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh and then I know I spoke to some of
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee already
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
and people felt comfortable that
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
represent Solomon so is there anybody uh
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
so I am prepared to concur do there
 
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
anybody have a opinion differently
 
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
representative pusc thank you Mr
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I'd like to ask the
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
representatives from The Liquor
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
Commission uh the Senate
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
removed uh a minimum of 15
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
days uh and they they just change it to
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
a maximum of 30 but there is no minimum
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to ask the commission's
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
good morning Chief good morning Mr
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
chairman for record Mark armaganian uh
 
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
Chief and director of liquor enforcement
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
licensing um thank you for your question
 
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative um again being neutral on
 
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
this uh as always uh we do see that
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
taking away minimums and up taking away
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
the hard deck um and opens an
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation but at the same time by
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
rule and through our hearings process
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
those minimums um can still be uh in
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
place uh just by virtue of a caseby
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
casee basis not just broad brushing
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
everything so um we don't look at it as
 
01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
a total
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
negative um but at the same time uh that
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's our stance on taking away
 
01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
minimums it leaves a broader
 
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation okay thank you more
 
01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.510 align:start position:0%
interpretation okay thank you more
