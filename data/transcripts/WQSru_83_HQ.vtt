good morning mr bernard
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
are we ready
 
00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:17.749 align:start position:0%
are we ready
yeah

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
well thank you chairman hunt and
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is uh jd
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
bernardi i'm representing rockingham 16
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
southampton kensington and east kingston
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to uh to sponsor 1469.
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
we'll start off with the concept of what
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
are esg scores
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
why did they come about who creates them
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
or what's gone and or going wrong with
 
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.430 align:start position:0%
or what's gone and or going wrong with
them

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
so esg scores
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
is an evaluation of a firm's collective
 
00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:52.390 align:start position:0%
is an evaluation of a firm's collective
consciousness

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
consciousness
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
concerning social justice corporate
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
governance and environmental factors
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're a score that's compiled from
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
data collected using metrics related to
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
those various factors
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
they can be considered sort of a
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
corporate social credit score
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
and these three factors together
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
comprise an assessment that's been
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
adopted by many u.s
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
and worldwide financial industry uh
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
provide investment decisions
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
in addition to the company's bottom line
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
proponents claim that the ultimate
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
objective of these
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
metrics it relates to corporate
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
sustainability and assessing societal
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
impact of the company
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
so what are these factors environmental
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
factors include
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%

00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
associated with the company's
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
corporate operations including their
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%

employee and executive compensation
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
who creates these scores well they're
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
created by
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
organizations and analytical firms like
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
bloomberg corporate knights sustained

thompson reuters rep risk and others
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
and at this point
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
almost all businesses that exist of any
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
size have an esg score
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
and if esg scores were to remain just a
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
business tool for an investor to use in
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
deciding whether they wanted to invest
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
in a business or not
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
this bill wouldn't be being proposed
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
permits the continued use of esg scores
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
for personal investment decisions
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
the problem addressed by this bill
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
is that there were there's a woke
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
movement that is attempting to weaponize
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
esg scores against companies and against
 
00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:35.190 align:start position:0%
esg scores against companies and against
individuals

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
the world economic forum published their
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
esg metrics in a in a report entitled
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%

of sustainable value creation
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
this was released in september of 2020
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%

and deloitte as well as the bank of
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
america it includes their 21 metrics and
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
32 expanded metrics
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
it divides these standards into pillars
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
governing principles of governance
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
principles of the planet of the people

and prosperity
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
it uses many of the same traditional esg
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
scores and some of these metrics are
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
very reasonable for any investor to use
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
but it also focuses on awoke ideology
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
criteria that are that are found in in
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
these scores
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
the goal of the world economic forum is
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
to mandate businesses focus their
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
corporate decision making on improving
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
all their distributors
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
will be unable to get funding or
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
financing for further growth
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
and continued operations
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
and if you're a fabricator
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
as an example of the firing pin of that
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
particular gun that you like but you
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
also make a spindle for a weaving loom
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
your company is going to be under the
 
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.910 align:start position:0%
your company is going to be under the
gun

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
the spread of the great resets esg's
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
fingers go deep into the system
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
there's little ability to stop the
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
global elites from manipulating society
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
and controlling political opponents with
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
the new additional metrics
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
because they're not done by government
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're being done by the elites
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
managing these companies
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
and it's not just corporations that are
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
going to be subject to the esg
 
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.670 align:start position:0%
going to be subject to the esg
system

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
individuals also have scores if you're
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
an investor and have any significant
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
assets in any uh
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
stocks you have an esg score
 
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.269 align:start position:0%
stocks you have an esg score
already

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
and it can easily be expanded by looking
 
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.310 align:start position:0%
and it can easily be expanded by looking
at

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
your purchases by reviewing your credit
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
card or bank statements
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
so your non-woke purchases or stock
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
picks will give you a low esg score
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
so then when you want to take that car
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
loan or mortgage that activity is going
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
to be curtailed by the bank
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
if you work for an unfavored industry or
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
or are a supplier or a distributor to
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
one your score will be reduced
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
unfavored industries will lose good
 
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.509 align:start position:0%
unfavored industries will lose good
employees

00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
so if you think this can't happen to you
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.870 align:start position:0%
this is
hyperbole

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
hyperbole
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
just remember
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
deutsche bank and signature bank in new
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
york decided that they're no longer
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.030 align:start position:0%

holly's book the tyranny of big tech
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
parlor a new social media platform was
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
removed from service by apple google and
 
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.710 align:start position:0%
removed from service by apple google and
amazon

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
amazon
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
big tech has demonetized
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
censored and removed people from their
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
platforms because their management
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't agree with the opinions of those
 
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.030 align:start position:0%
doesn't agree with the opinions of those
people

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
all this is being done by the elites
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
managing these companies
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
not by government
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
so the problem with the issue scores is
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
the ability and the willingness to
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
weaponize them against individuals and
 
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.749 align:start position:0%
weaponize them against individuals and
companies

00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
using esg scores as a personal
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
investment tool is perfectly legitimate
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
weaponizing them against corporations
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
and individuals is not
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
such discriminatory discriminatory
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
the plans to implement to the great
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
resets tyranny exist
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms of all esg scores and
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
whatnot are in place the commitment of
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
major financial and corporate
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
institutions to mandate their vision of
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
wokeness against the politically
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
please do not permit this discrimination
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire please do not allow
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
weaponization of these techniques here
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
support hb 1469
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
to prevent
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
inestimable harm to the citizens of new
 
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.510 align:start position:0%
inestimable harm to the citizens of new

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming before us and um
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
bringing this issue to us
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
you used the term woke movement and woke
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
um a number of times in your speech
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
so if you look at
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at the esg scores that
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
are being advanced so let's take
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
environmental scoring for example
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
climate change a judgment is being made
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
that if
 
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.750 align:start position:0%
that if
uh

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
if if you aren't 100
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
supporting all electric vehicles you're
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
going to be downgraded because you're
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
not because you're advocating the
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
continued use of oil or diesel or
 
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
continued use of oil or diesel or
gasoline

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
gasoline
 
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.750 align:start position:0%
gasoline
powered

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
powered
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles that's part of the woke
 
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.990 align:start position:0%
vehicles that's part of the woke
movement

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
movement
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm still not clear um you're
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
giving me an example of how the esg
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
score might be used but i don't
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand what you mean by woke
 
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.870 align:start position:0%
understand what you mean by woke
movement

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
movement
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
woke a leftist movement uh a movement
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
that's focused on
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
picking winning winners and losers based
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
i think she's asking what does woke mean
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
what does woke what does woke mean
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
it does have a definition
 
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.870 align:start position:0%
it does have a definition
uh

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
well i would i would characterize that
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
as i said as a leftist focused
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
assessment or belief in uh
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
technology business interpersonal
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
interactions i mean it's it's it's a
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
series of
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
if you look in these esg scores
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh let's take diversity if your if your
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
business uh
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the right ratio of all the
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
quote unquote right people in it if you
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
if you're a new hampshire business and
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
you have largely white men working for
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
you you're you're not woke
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
you need to have a bunch of women and a
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of minorities that don't ex that
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
you may not have the qualifications
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
because of this you know what exists in
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
this state
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
but you're not woke because
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
you don't meet that criteria
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
you keep saying political you're like
 
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.230 align:start position:0%
you keep saying political you're like
leftist

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
leftist
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes so that implies a wokism
 
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.029 align:start position:0%
yes so that implies a wokism
is

00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
leftist center
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
and wants to
 
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.430 align:start position:0%
and wants to
[Music]

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
make decisions based upon their
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
political beliefs
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
and and that's fine one can have
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
whatever political belief you want
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's not the the purpose here the the
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
function the the discussion is about the
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
fact that collectively there's this
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
group of elites has decided
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
this is the way things are going to be
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
done and using
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
that point of view to force
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
decisions on everyone else
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
so if i understand correctly the
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
political elites that you're talking
 
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.950 align:start position:0%
political elites that you're talking
about

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
are um
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
board of directors of a bank
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
or the president
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
the the officers as i mentioned we had
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the leaders of the big four
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
accounting firms bank of america
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
google apple uh you know making these
 
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.190 align:start position:0%
google apple uh you know making these
decisions

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
those leaders
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
viewpoint that is
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
decidedly leftist and decidedly
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
anti-any maybe conservative or
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
intermediate position
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
and are
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
demanding compliance so
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
parlor disappeared because they had
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
their website or their their social
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
media site allowed any point of view to
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
happen it wasn't constrained to the
 
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.789 align:start position:0%
happen it wasn't constrained to the
perfect

00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
woke positions
 
00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.950 align:start position:0%
woke positions
so

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure i get this right okay
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm focusing in on
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
the right of a corporation or issue a
 
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
the right of a corporation or issue a
bank

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
bank
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
to decide
 
00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:25.350 align:start position:0%
to decide
that

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
they are going now to be political
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
because they're leftists
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
and they want to
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
affect their political agenda
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
on someone who has come to them for a
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
bank loan
 
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
bank loan
yes

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
and the question is
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
that how do we that this is their
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
perspective this is their opinion
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
what you're telling me is that
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
we the legislature are going to say is
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
that you're not allowed
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
to have a political opinion
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to your business
 
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.230 align:start position:0%
when it comes to your business
activities

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
i'm saying you're not allowed to
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate against individuals because
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
of their political opinion
 
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.590 align:start position:0%
of their political opinion
so

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
if you're going to get that bank loan
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
yet you're a gun owner
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
and you
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
show up at the pta meeting and you say
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
you don't want
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
critical race theory being taught
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
your your individual score is going to
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
be downgraded and under the esg system
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
because you are not woke
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
and therefore we the bank are going to
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
use that criteria against you in not
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
giving you the car loan they're not
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
giving you the mortgage they're not
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to look at what is your ability to
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
repay the loan
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
as a normal bank would i'm going to give
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
you a loan
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
here's the criteria can you pay this
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
loan back do you have the wherewithal
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
and income stream to pay that loan back
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's what a bank ought to be looking
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
at not my politics in deciding whether i
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
am worthy to get that loan so you cannot
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
the bill basically says you may not
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on that those kinds
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
of criteria
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
so um i obviously
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
i sit on a family foundation
 
00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:19.669 align:start position:0%
i sit on a family foundation
and

00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
esg has been around for
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
years years
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
there is the scoring system of an esg
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're getting scored on your positives
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
what you are doing
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
on those esg categories
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
i've never seen an esg analysis to
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
use to
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
degrade a company's value that it's
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
always is this is what they are doing
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
not what they're not doing i guess
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
how does someone
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
know what their esg score is
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
how does someone how does someone
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
evaluate that score and and how does the
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
bank department i guess as i assume
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
i i don't even know how how this is
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
going to get enforced but
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
rule that there's some kind of evidence
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
some kind of scoring system that they
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
can get their hands on that documents
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
that this said someone was harmed
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
by this scoring system
 
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.669 align:start position:0%
by this scoring system
so

00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
how does
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
how do you understand how does one get
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
the score so all the the the the
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
companies that exist virtually all
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
companies of any size
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
are scored and i went through the
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
various uh stock owned companies these
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
are these are publicly traded yes
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
whether it be banks or other you know
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
companies they have esg scores
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
and they are rated on those criteria and
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
if you're an oil company
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have a good sgs esg
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
score if you're a firearms company
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have a good esg
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
score if you are any other unfavored
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
industry you're not going to have a good
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
esg score and as an individual
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
if you are an investor in those
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
investors are also being scored and so
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
individuals get esg scores what kind of
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
companies did you invest in
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
so if you own
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
so how does someone see that score how
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
does someone get that number where where
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
is this number published or where where
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
does someone get this or is this is that
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
a secret secret
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
right right now if you uh if you're an
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
investor in merrell uh in merrill lynch
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
merrill lynch has a score for your
 
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.470 align:start position:0%
merrill lynch has a score for your
investments

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
investments
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
it does you personally have that score
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
right so that so when i contact my bank
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know they contact me and
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
and if i were to ask them okay what is
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
the esg scores of those of these
 
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.750 align:start position:0%
the esg scores of those of these
businesses

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to make it and as i hear
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
from you you're telling me that's
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
perfectly okay
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
but now what you're saying is but if
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm a bank
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at those scores
 
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.070 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at those scores
that

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
this legislation would
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
perceive that that if i don't give a
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
loan to an institute to somebody
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
i could be
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
guilty of this
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
simply because that that business is
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
perceived to have
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
that score but you're holding that
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
financial institution responsible
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
simply because they didn't give the loan
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
well if you don't get a loan from the
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
bank the bank has to tell you why you
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
didn't get the loan
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
right they go over and say all right we
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
looked at your financials
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
mr smith
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
you you don't have the wherewithal to
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
pay this money back you don't have a
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
credible income stream
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay don't have a collateral so if they
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
if they say that
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's fine and if they can demonstrate
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
that that's fine
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
but if they're using esg criteria to say
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
you you you bought a sig sauer last week
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
and your bank your
 
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
we have your credit card statement
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
we're not giving loans to people like
 
00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:16.789 align:start position:0%
we're not giving loans to people like
you

00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
that is the discrimination i'm talking
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
about you think something could actually
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
do that they would actually say we know
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
that you bought
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
a gun and we're not giving you the loan
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
because you think some bank would do
 
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.110 align:start position:0%
because you think some bank would do
that

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
yes that is the goal of the great reset
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
that is the advertised prescribed goal
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
of the members of these organizations
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
saying we want to implement these
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
criteria on the management decisions of
 
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.750 align:start position:0%
criteria on the management decisions of
companies

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
as well as on individuals
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
it is is it here right now no the system
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
is set up esg scores and what not
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
ability to evaluate is set up so
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
mechanically it can be turned on and it
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
then the idea is it will be turned on
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
and their goal is to have this in place
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
by 2030.
 
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.430 align:start position:0%
by 2030.
great

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.830 align:start position:0%
great
uh

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative mclaren um
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
you you seem to blame this all on
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
the left
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
is is it possible that a group on the
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
right would have the same woke attitude
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
about companies or is it only on the
 
00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:30.070 align:start position:0%
about companies or is it only on the
left

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's certainly possible that you know
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
the the criteria could be used uh
 
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
the the criteria could be used uh
equivalently

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
equivalently
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
from the from the right that that that's
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
not the the subject of the
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
you know of the
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill the idea is you should not
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
be able to use political
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
decision-making criteria in making
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
decisions to make uh your financial uh
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
financial decisions
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.149 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
establish these esg scores
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying there's a conspiracy i'm
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
saying that esg scores the concept of
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
sustainability esg scores has been
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
created and has been used by investors
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's no problem with that because
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's your choice
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
or my choice if i want to invest in
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
stocks that have high esg scores based
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
on the kind of criteria that are being
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
proposed or being
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
evaluated that's fine and if i want to
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
change those criteria and say i want esg
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
scores that look at
 
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.230 align:start position:0%
scores that look at
more

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
conservative focused criteria and and
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
make decisions on my business that way
 
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.870 align:start position:0%
make decisions on my business that way
or

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
or who i'm going to deal with you can do
 
00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
or who i'm going to deal with you can do
that

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
because those are personal decisions
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
okay well i got a scenario for you
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
so human rights
 
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
so human rights
groups

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
groups
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
have identified certain companies
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
the united states that are
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
using chinese
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
child labor work labor you know the uh
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
criminal let's say criminal activity you
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
know the people who are uh injured we
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
your labor
 
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.230 align:start position:0%
your labor
okay

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
someone says i'm not going to invest in
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
that company because of that report
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.389 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
if that
 
00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.950 align:start position:0%
if that
is

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
if an individual wants to make that
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
decision the individual has the right to
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
do that but a business
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
this is a business giving a loan to that
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
corporation that business this is a bank
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
that wants to loan you know that this
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
company's come to her alone
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
and they're saying is well we don't want
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
to do business with you because
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
you have we don't want to do business
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
with nike because nike's using uyghur
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
labor there you go
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh that would be uh yes that would be an
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
act if that is the sole reason
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
that they give all right well it's just
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
a one of the many
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
you've got all the metrics as far as the
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
financials you pass we can get we'll
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
give you the loans so we're assuming
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
nike is a financially sound company yeah
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and that but the bank says no we're
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
not going to loan to you because of this
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
situation in china
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
and therefore they should be guilty of
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
this of this bill that would be yeah
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
that would be discrimination
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
that way yes okay
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
any other question representative
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
i i think that um thank you mr chair i
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
think um mr chair you alluded to the
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
idea that how would the banking
 
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.070 align:start position:0%
idea that how would the banking
department

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
how would the witch say in
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
how would the banking department monitor
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
and enforce this bill
 
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.310 align:start position:0%
and enforce this bill
well

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
again if you were if you were requesting
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
a loan
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
as a business or
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
as an individual you're going to get a
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
your loan was possible to be
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
given or not
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
and if it's if it can't be given
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
some of some criteria beyond
 
00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:43.110 align:start position:0%
some of some criteria beyond
financials

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
financials
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
now now they they have to tell you that
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
and so now you have the ability to
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
report that to the banking industry and
 
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.549 align:start position:0%
report that to the banking industry and
say

00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm being discriminated against
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to be a claim made by
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
the individual based on
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
report from
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
from those denied services
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
in the case that you're talking about
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh i think you're a co-sponsor so you
 
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.389 align:start position:0%
uh i think you're a co-sponsor so you
can't

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
you can't ask questions now
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
you can testify
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
but you can't ask questions
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you chair will uh
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
call on
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative who's in support of the
 
00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:43.349 align:start position:0%
representative who's in support of the
bill

00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
the highlights from my testimony i don't
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
tend to write out
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
my testimony i speak
 
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.390 align:start position:0%
my testimony i speak
extemporaneously

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
extemporaneously

i want to focus my ten
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
well i should start out by saying that i

the science technology and energy
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
committee and i want to focus my
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning on
 
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.550 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning on
the

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
aspect of esg
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
that i found find most troubling and
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.829 align:start position:0%
that is
its

00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
its
 
00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
its
promotion

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
promotion
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
of the divestiture of fossil fuels
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
as a way to combat
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
now i've done a lot of reading and
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
studying about climate change over the
 
00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.630 align:start position:0%
studying about climate change over the
years

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
and it's become clear to me
 
00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.349 align:start position:0%
and it's become clear to me
that

00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
the science is far from settled science
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
is never settled in fact
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
there is no way to say definitively
 
00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:12.390 align:start position:0%
there is no way to say definitively
that

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide is the control knob of
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
the climate
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
there's just too much research out there
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
that says that isn't so
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
but even though
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
the media narrative is that
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
is the culprit
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's too complex a question for the
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
media to grapple with so they they latch
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
onto that idea and promote it
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
its validity in the scientific
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
literature is being
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
but if you
 
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
but if you
believe

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.950 align:start position:0%
believe
that

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide is causing climate change
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
and we humans are burning fossil fuels
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
and increasing the amount of carbon
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
dioxide that there is in the atmosphere
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
you might conclude
 
00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.630 align:start position:0%
you might conclude
that

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
stopping the burning of fossil fuels
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the esg
 
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.589 align:start position:0%
and the esg
movement

00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
movement
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
is moving in the direction of trying to
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
convince companies to divest
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
their investments in the fossil fuel
 
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.069 align:start position:0%
their investments in the fossil fuel
industry

00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
that movement
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
is the net zero banking alliance
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
which is a
consortium

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
consortium
 
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.589 align:start position:0%
consortium
of

00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
instant institutions from around the
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
seeks to
 
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.390 align:start position:0%
seeks to
encourage

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
the divestiture of
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
investments in fossil fuels by 2050.
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
currently the net zero banking alliance
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
had includes seven of the largest and
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
most influential banks in the united
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
states including bank of america city
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
jpmorgan chase morgan stanley goldman
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
sachs wells fargo and amalgamated bank
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
together these banks control over 66
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars in assets
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
these banks are seeking to use their
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
influence and they use esg scores as
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
part of that influence
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
funds that invest in fossil fuels to
 
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.589 align:start position:0%
funds that invest in fossil fuels to
divest

00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
divest
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
those investments
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
so retirement funds for example that
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
invest in fossil fuels
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
the net zero banking alliance would
 
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.310 align:start position:0%
the net zero banking alliance would
discourage

00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
discourage
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
those retirement funds from investing in
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
well why does that matter
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
could collapse
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
the fossil fuel industry
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the collapse of the fossil fuel
 
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.349 align:start position:0%
and the collapse of the fossil fuel
industry

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
would kill more people
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
the world runs on fossil fuel fuels
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
85 of our energy comes from fossil fuels
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
if we collapse the fossil fuel market
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
through financial manipulation
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
such as that
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
envisioned by the net zero banking
 
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.349 align:start position:0%
envisioned by the net zero banking
alliance

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
will destabilize the world
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
killed millions possibly even billions
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:55.670 align:start position:0%
of people
and

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.190 align:start position:0%
and
create

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
instability and chaos
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's why i think
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
bills such as this one
 
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
bills such as this one
that

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
discourage discrimination based on esg
 
00:40:11.839 --> 00:40:13.349 align:start position:0%
discourage discrimination based on esg
criteria

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
are absolutely necessary
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
for us to
 
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.630 align:start position:0%
for us to
prevent

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
a calamity in the world
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
now climate change
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
may turn out to be a problem
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's still an open question
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
but it won't even if it does turn out to
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
be a problem it won't be nearly as big a
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
problem as we would have
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
if the fossil fuel industry collapsed
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
because of the manipulations
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
such as those that are members of the
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
net zero banking alliance
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
so i urge the committee to give serious
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
consideration to passing this
 
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.069 align:start position:0%
consideration to passing this
legislation

00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
if it needs amendment to make it
 
00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.430 align:start position:0%
if it needs amendment to make it
enforceable

00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
to make it applicable
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
then i encourage you to
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
work with the bill sponsor to find
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
those amendments
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
that's uh my testimony for this morning
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
oh we do have a question
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
if i can ask this question is it's about
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
boys and means or
 
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.390 align:start position:0%
boys and means or
uh

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.750 align:start position:0%
you could
just

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's there is a fiscal note there is
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note yes so what's in fiscal
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
notes did you
 
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.790 align:start position:0%
notes did you
yes

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.069 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:40.870 align:start position:0%
um
not

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
if you read indeterminate right
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
but um could you
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal note
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
confused

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
confused
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
in that you would be
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
presenting a bill to
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
this committee that has a fiscal note to
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
no that's not a question no can you just
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's asking his your hearts and minds
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know then well i'm surprised i'm
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
shocked that you would
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know no we don't ask questions like
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
that that's not a question
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
you're asking his motivation no we do
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
not ask people their motivation
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just talking about the
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal note and the physical
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
note says zero so that means there
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any problem and i would
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
remind the
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
member that
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes are
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
not something that the bill sponsor has
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
anything to do with a fiscal note is a
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
determination by the speaker's office
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
and the legislative budget assistance
 
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.430 align:start position:0%
and the legislative budget assistance
office

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
that there might be some financial
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
impact of the bill and they try to
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
assess what that is but it has nothing
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
to do with the bill sponsor
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.710 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
yes

00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative johnson thank you for
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
um do you have actual evidence of
 
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.309 align:start position:0%
um do you have actual evidence of
discrimination

00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
of this nature of this bill against
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
individuals or businesses based on esg
 
00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.790 align:start position:0%
individuals or businesses based on esg
scores

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
well if you consider the fact that the
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
net zero banking alliance is encouraging
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
retirement funds to divest of fossil
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
fuels i'd say that's evidence yes
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
further question further question
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
is the government officially
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
participating in the world economic
 
00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:37.190 align:start position:0%
participating in the world economic
forum

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
the world economic forum
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
i suspect not but
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
it could be there is a link at the
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
bottom of the testimony that i submitted
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
that explains what the net zero banking
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
alliance is and how it operates and how
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
it works
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
i encourage you to visit that link and
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
learn more about the net zero
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative mclair
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at your notes here
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
and uh down at the bottom it says the
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
end game and it says there lies the path
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
to collectivism could you elaborate on
 
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.910 align:start position:0%
to collectivism could you elaborate on
that

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
what that bullet basically means is that
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
if you look at the economy of china
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
watered-down version of capitalism
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
called collectivism
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
so the government doesn't own
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
the means of production
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
as it would in a traditional communist
 
00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:52.309 align:start position:0%
as it would in a traditional communist
society

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
the chinese government allows
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
individual chinese citizens to own
 
00:44:57.839 --> 00:44:59.430 align:start position:0%
individual chinese citizens to own
businesses

00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
but it then basically tells people how
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
they can run their businesses what they
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
can and can't do
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
to the extent that the government
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
essentially controls business and that's
 
00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.829 align:start position:0%
essentially controls business and that's
collectivism

00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
collectivism
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
and the great reset to capitalism as
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
described in the book referred to by the
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
previous speaker
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
describes how
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
we're on the road to a similar sort of
 
00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.230 align:start position:0%
we're on the road to a similar sort of
collectivism

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
collectivism
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
and that the esg score
 
00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:29.910 align:start position:0%
and that the esg score
mechanism

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative hunt pointed out has been
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
around for a long time
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
is a mechanism that can be manipulated
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.030 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
testimony

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh the chair will call on
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh christy merrill

representing the new hampshire bankers
 
00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.550 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire bankers
association

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair and honorable
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
members of the house commerce committee
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
my name is christy merrill i'm president
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire bankers association
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
we represent 38 member banks which
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
employ nearly 6 000 employees
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we're here today to oppose the
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
legislation there's been a lot of
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
conversation about
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
the esg scores
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
and it's been very fascinating to listen
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
to but i'm really going to just focus my
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
comments on the legislation
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
which really focuses on the title talks
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
about social credit scores so um we
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually agree with the sponsor that
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
banks and businesses should not
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on subject subjective
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
and arbitrary standards like social
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
media posts
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
we are concerned however that the
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
legislation will do more harm than good
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
and will invite frivolous lawsuits by
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
any disgruntled bank customer
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
the title of the bill suggests that it's
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
focused on social credit scores
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
but it actually goes much more beyond
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
that specifically 14 house bill 1469
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
would prohibit banks and other
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
businesses from discriminating against
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
any person or business based on
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
subjective or arbitrary standards such
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
as social media posts affiliations with
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
clubs and and it goes on
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
on its face that may not seem
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
controversial but there's a few things i
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
want to point out that we think are
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
really problematic with the legislation
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
the legislation does not define
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination in any way
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
nor does it define the phrase adverse
 
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.950 align:start position:0%
nor does it define the phrase adverse
treatment

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
we're of the opinion that it will most
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
certainly invite litigation against
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
banks and other financial institutions
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
with such an broad and opened
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
terminology it leaves the door wide open
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
for any citizen whether they're an
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
employee a customer otherwise to bring a
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
complaint against a bank for any
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
perceived discrimination or adverse
 
00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:05.430 align:start position:0%
perceived discrimination or adverse
treatment

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
and this would put the bank in a very
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
difficult position of trying to disprove
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
an allegation that a decision was based
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
on subjective standards
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
when you couple that with the hefty
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
fines that are in the legislation this
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly will subject banks to
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
significant litigation for any conduct
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
that might be perceived as
 
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.150 align:start position:0%
that might be perceived as
discriminatory

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to point out that the
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
phrase business practices on page 1
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
lines 12-13 that's also not defined and
 
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.030 align:start position:0%
lines 12-13 that's also not defined and
so

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's not clear what's included but as
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
it's drafted it would likely be
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
interpreted to include hiring or
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
and a last point that i think is is
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
really important is that we believe this
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
bill is unnecessary because banks are
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
already subjected to extensive
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
regulation which prohibit prohibit
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination in several ways
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
for example the community reinvestment
 
00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.549 align:start position:0%
for example the community reinvestment
act

00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
the fair credit reporting act the equal
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
credit opportunity act and the fair
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
housing act they all prohibit
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination in various contexts
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i just want to go a little deeper on
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
what's known as the cra the community
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
reinvestment act
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
when they're examined regular regulators
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
specifically examine banks to evaluate
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
whether a bank is engaging in
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
discriminate discriminatory or other
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
legal conduct in lending which includes
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
a review of the nature extent and
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
strength of the evidence of the
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
practices the policies and the
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
procedures that the bank or savings
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
association has in place to prevent the
 
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.470 align:start position:0%
association has in place to prevent the
practices

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
and any corrective action that the
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
banker or savings association has taken
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
or committed to take including voluntary
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
corrective action resulting from
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
self-assessment and other any other
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
relevant information
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
and we've got the federal citation for
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
that um these provisions that's in
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
all of the other requirements that
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
businesses and employers are already
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
subject to that prohibit discrimination
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
such as the ada the adea the equal pay
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
act and the civil rights act
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
so in in some we agree that new
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire banks oppose discrimination as
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
should all businesses um however our we
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
have objections with this legislation um
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we believe there are serious
 
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.430 align:start position:0%
and we believe there are serious
consequences

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
with some of these open-ended provisions
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
that they could pose for our members and
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons we oppose the
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and we would respectfully
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
so if i understand your testimony
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
correctly that the anti-discrimination
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
law now
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
in place could be used if someone felt
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
that they bank
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
didn't give him a loan because he just
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
bought a sig saucer a week ago
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
we banks are already subject to those
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
did you want to ask a question oh yes so
 
00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:01.430 align:start position:0%

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
or even state banks that are that are
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
federally federally regulated um thank
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative um
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
it's our understanding that the banking
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
department regulates others other
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
institutions as well besides just state
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
chartered banks but i think that's a
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
good question it's not clear to us based
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
on where this statute lies and these
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
provisions lie as to how that how that
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
relates to federally chartered banks and
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
if this would only apply to state
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
xenon thank you thank you oh did you
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
have a question i'm sorry
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
i believe i heard
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
earlier in your testimony
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
that you had a concern
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore were opposed to
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation as presented
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
on the basis of there being no
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
definition of discrimination that's
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
line four
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me my reading
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
that discrimination
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
is defined as being based on esg scores
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
is there something i'm missing here
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
because esg scores by their very nature
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
reference criteria
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
and standards
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
in order to determine such a score
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
and the way i read this sentence
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
discrimination is based
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
upon that score
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
the utilization
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
of that score
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little perplexed and wish that
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
you could clarify that and elaborate
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
please sure um so
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
section one is the purpose statement and
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
so you're right it does have that
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
explanation that elaborates on
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination being based on
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
such scores
 
00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.390 align:start position:0%
such scores
but

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
it does not amend any statute and so as
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
a purpose statement i don't know that
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
that is a binding definition
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
there are further in that section too
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
there there are further kind of examples
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
of discrimination um and it kind of
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
describes it but it's not clear that it
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually defines what discrimination is
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
follow up please further question me
 
00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.510 align:start position:0%
follow up please further question me
inquire

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
so would it satisfy your concern
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
that discrimination is
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
not defined
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
within the subparagraphs of
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
the rsa that is cited in line 9 be
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
satisfied if in fact
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination was defined
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
yeah somewhere in
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
section two
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
as discrimination based on esg scores
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
would that not remedy your concern
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
um representative i'd be happy to take a
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
look at that i think that would improve
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
upon some of the concerns that we have
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
but as we mentioned we still do have
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
other concerns there are other terms
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
that are not defined and we also don't
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
believe it's necessary can i finalize
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
here please with respect to that
 
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.470 align:start position:0%
here please with respect to that
particular

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh concern would you follow up with me
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
please and the committee and address
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
that concern in writing
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative are you asking me to
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
define discrimination no i'm asking you
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
whether what i proposed would in fact
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
satisfy your concern that discrimination
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
is not defined
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
i as i you're saying you don't have the
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
ability to do that yourself
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
would you after in consultation and
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
study with colleagues be able to get
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
back to me and and give me an answer i'm
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to look at anything that
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
you want to share with us representative
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh well i just did thank you
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think it's best that you email
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
her your exact
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh resolute what you think is the way to
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
resolve that question
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
and then you want me to reiterate what i
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
said i don't know
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just we're relying on the clerk i
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
guess we could re-see the tape we can
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
watch the tape but i think the best
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
thing to do is you to spell out exactly
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
what your question is
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
and then email it to her and all of us
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
and then we can make sure that they
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%

the state level in each and every state
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses a growing insidious
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
undermining threat to the freedom and
 
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
association investment of
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
your constituents and private businesses
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
in your state this is a far too evidence
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
today to dismiss this as conspiracy
 
00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:00.870 align:start position:0%
today to dismiss this as conspiracy
theories

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
theories
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
as stated so well in the declaration of
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
purpose in this particular bill
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
this is a matter of state concern that
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
directly impacts your citizens and
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
private businesses in new hampshire
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
just two years ago it would be hard to
 
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
imagine any citizens
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
access to banking insurance travel goods
 
00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.030 align:start position:0%
access to banking insurance travel goods
services

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
that would be restricted in any way
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
the freedoms and liberties are are so
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
great in our in our states and in our in
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
our nation
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
but we are starting to see this happen
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i will say i've been
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
studying this issue and testified across
 
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.430 align:start position:0%
studying this issue and testified across
the

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.470 align:start position:0%
the
states

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with esg issues for a couple of
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
years now this is probably one of the
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
better written
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation as a former
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
legislator of 18 years in north dakota i
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
i've seen a bit and written a bit and
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
and i i really like the wording of this
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
much better than the direction other
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
so in this and i and i do believe i
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
barry i can't i'm sorry i can't see the
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
name terry
 
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.309 align:start position:0%
name terry
um

00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
his point of moving that purpose
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
statement i think is is is well heard i
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
i agree with that type of thing
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
i would say that as it's being in the
 
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.109 align:start position:0%
i would say that as it's being in the
declaration

00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
declaration
 
00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:28.789 align:start position:0%
declaration
above

00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
does give legislative intent so once the
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
intent is in place then that does direct
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
even though it's not written into the
 
00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.829 align:start position:0%
even though it's not written into the
language

00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:59:37.839 --> 00:59:39.430 align:start position:0%
language
so

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
well well point well made
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
so in first learning about social credit
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
systems is a couple years ago as i was
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
reading about some things in china that
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
were taking place
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
the choices actions and interactions of
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
individuals in china are so closely
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
monitors and the scores are based on
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
these arbitrary
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
subjective standards set up by their
 
01:00:00.799 --> 01:00:02.230 align:start position:0%
subjective standards set up by their
government

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
in in this
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
at a time that i thought this type of
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
thing would never happen here it is
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
starting to happen
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
and so in china what they have is they
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
have a system where they can actually
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
monitor your eyes and so if you're out
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
on the street they see who you're
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
talking to
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
if you're shopping and you stop and you
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
look at a particular article a
 
01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:27.270 align:start position:0%
look at a particular article a
product

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
your scores are automatically rolling
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
through what the government has set up
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
for those standards
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
and so there are criterias that are in
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
place in other nations we are not to
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
that point thank goodness and yet
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
the availability of that type of thing
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
is there and so just just so you're
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
aware that um this isn't something new
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
it isn't something somebody just made up
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
as a conspiracy thing
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
um even on even in our weakened form of
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
federalism and state autonomy the state
 
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
federalism and state autonomy the state
cannot

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
fully control behaviors choices and
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
actions of our citizens
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
exert far more control than many of us
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
have ever really realized and i think
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen that over the last couple
 
01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.270 align:start position:0%
we've seen that over the last couple
years

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
the growing threat to individual
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
freedoms and liberty is not coming from
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
the government alone but from the
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
collusion of the government with these
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
large corporations
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
and so more and more we are seeing large
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
businesses money-centered banks
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and airlines
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
implementing efforts to steer the
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
economy and the choices of the citizens
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
with the nodding approval and privilege
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
provided to them by our govern
 
01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.750 align:start position:0%
provided to them by our govern
government

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
this is stated in their mission
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
statements and so mr chairman if you
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
would would like later i can send to you
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
to pass along to the committee the
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
mission statements of bank of america
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
blackrock lloyd's of london and
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
wells fargo i happen to have those with
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
me they specifically state how they are
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring and how they want to do this
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
so well why does that matter to new
 
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.549 align:start position:0%
so well why does that matter to new
hampshire

01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
as our banking person just stated
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
they have their
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
things they're going to follow well
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
their funding or their backing comes
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
from an fdic
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
these will also then are the money comes
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
from the big guys down to the little
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
guys so if these guys say well we're not
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
going to give you money to loan we're
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
not going to offer and back the
 
01:02:33.839 --> 01:02:36.710 align:start position:0%
not going to offer and back the
insurance

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
applications that you're wanting to
 
01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.750 align:start position:0%
applications that you're wanting to
approve

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
approve
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
then they can't do that work
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
it's a top-down thing and it and it does
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
happen it's happening in
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen it
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
in our coal industry in north dakota
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
where our coal companies were seen on a
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis their insurance go up
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
and up and up and up and why was that
 
01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.789 align:start position:0%
and up and up and up and why was that
because

01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
lloyds of london were saying we are
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
going to divest from fossil fuel
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
so they weren't allowing insurance to
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
take place in those
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're not allowing these things to be
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
insured or and by doing that instead of
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
saying we're not going to insure you
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
we're just going to jack your rates
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is not china
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
but because we have the safeguards
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
against it
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
but if access to banking credit cards
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
loans and travel and our goods and
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
services are restricted from this
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
top-down subjective measuring stick
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
how is it any different than a state
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
employees post restrictions the results
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
from individual citizens is the same
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
as well documented in the book that was
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
earlier the great reset my colleague
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%

beck
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
have been monitoring social media on esg
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
the environmental social governance
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
movement to social credit scoring
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
it is all interconnected
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
the results is less choice less freedom
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
and a dimming of the american dream for
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
the average citizen
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
this is not some boogie man from the
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
future it is here in 2019
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
the article
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
by the world economic forum which was
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
spoken apart
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
just recently introduced a credit card
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
that will track the carbon footprint as
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
you spend and will cut off your spending
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
once you reach their arbitrary carbon
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
limit that's mastercard has done that
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
now you can choose not to have that
 
01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.710 align:start position:0%
now you can choose not to have that
mastercard

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
mastercard
 
01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.589 align:start position:0%
mastercard
but

01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's the wave of the future we've all
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
seen things happen where this guy's it's
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
the test run
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
and then they will move to everybody
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
having to follow this carbon footprint
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
less than a year ago cbs market watch
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
ran an article stating that mastercard
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
will track it and that that type of
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
spending and if you should have received
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
my testimony you will have links to both
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
of those within the electronic testimony
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
please feel free to follow back up don't
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
take my word for it read it yourself
 
01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.990 align:start position:0%
take my word for it read it yourself
the

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
best way to protect the freedoms and the
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
choices of our citizens and and in the
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
great state of new hampshire
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
these subjective standards
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
on how we should live our lives need to
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
be protected we need to protect our
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
local businesses our local independent
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
banks from this coercion and the
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
leverage of the suppliers and
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
correspondent relationships
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
having served in the north dakota
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
legislature for over 18 years
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
but i never saw this type of an
 
01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
insidious over overtaking
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
in in my time of the freedoms of our
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
choices and our liberties today
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
we are an enter north dakota is an
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
energy and agricultural producing state
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
you guys are very agricultural too
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
and with that these are direct targets
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
call it what you like but the impacts on
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
our lives will be
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
in our contingent constituents
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
from the collusion of these large
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
businesses federal government cannot be
 
01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.150 align:start position:0%
businesses federal government cannot be
ignored

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%

i
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
i will stand for question but a couple

of just quick answer some of the
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
questions that were coming up um
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
if i can remember them all here
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
yes the the rating system is in place
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen it in the coal industry
 
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.670 align:start position:0%
we've seen it in the coal industry
already

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
so yes this is happening
 
01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.150 align:start position:0%
so yes this is happening
um

um
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes we are involved in the world
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
economic forum i don't recall who asked
 
01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
economic forum i don't recall who asked
that

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%

your testimony
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
in making your way from one
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
frozen state to another frozen state to
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
do so today
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh once again uh as with the my prior
 
01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:13.750 align:start position:0%
uh once again uh as with the my prior
question

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to reference
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
something that you said early on in your
 
01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.349 align:start position:0%
something that you said early on in your
testimony

01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
um i believe that you described
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
communist china's esgs as arbitrary and
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
would you would you also be in agreement
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
particularly with reference to
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
how they are determined
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
and perhaps in contrast to the common
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
understanding of the word arbitrary
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
patently ideological
 
01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:55.990 align:start position:0%
patently ideological
philosophical

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
philosophical
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
and political
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
and further
 
01:09:00.159 --> 01:09:01.349 align:start position:0%
and further
the

01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
design of a command-and-control
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
economy in society
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and representative
 
01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and representative
terry

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
terry
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
when when china has set this up they're
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
setting it up for control of their
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
citizens through their government
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
opinions so a lot of what they are
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
ranking theirs on
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
are on um political uh standout so if
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
you're not uh following their political
 
01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.070 align:start position:0%
you're not uh following their political
ideals

01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
ideals
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
that what they utilize it mostly for is
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
their means of purchase and
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
transportation is all in a chip form
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
and so if i my score gets too low my
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
chip won't let me on the bus
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
if my chip score gets too low or they
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
prevent me from purchasing a particular
 
01:09:54.159 --> 01:09:55.350 align:start position:0%
prevent me from purchasing a particular
thing

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
my chip won't work for the purpose
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
in that purchase
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
now we're not to that extreme
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
but when a country
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
that large
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
that is gaining this much control is
 
01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:10.950 align:start position:0%
that is gaining this much control is
taking

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
taking
it

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
we need to be
 
01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
we need to be
aware

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
aware
 
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
aware
and

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
have i addressed that correctly quick
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up then with respect to the uh
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
the the the esg applications here in
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
this country at this time
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
would you agree that there is some at
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
least some element of ideology
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
philosophy and and and political element
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and representative terry
 
01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.310 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and representative terry
yes

in looking at social credit scores
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%

disclaimer at the bottom of point one
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.550 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
maria perez from milford so is this
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
going to happen more often is that the
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
reason why they're here because we would
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
never be executing anything today um
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
i understand um i don't have the answer
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
to that at this time um both both of
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
these um
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
just be able to be we're not vote we
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't in commerce or at least as long as
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
i am chairman
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
i have never voted on any bill on the
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
same day in which we've heard it
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
i believe every bill deserves 24 hours
 
01:16:24.239 --> 01:16:25.030 align:start position:0%
i believe every bill deserves 24 hours
so

01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
so we would if we were to exec a bill it
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
would be published in the in the
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%

01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
and in favor of house bill 1237 which is
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
relative cigar to cigar bars in other
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
words if house bill 12 37 becomes law
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
the amount of revenue from a business
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
establishment in order to qualify as a
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
cigar bar would at least be temporarily
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
lowered from 60 to 30 percent
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
and frankly i introduced this bill at a
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
request of a claremont constituent who
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
is concerned about the impact of house
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
bill 392 which passed in 2009
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
and is now law which requires that 60 of
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
all revenue from cigar bars be from the
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
sale of cigars
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
he believes this well-intentioned bill
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
that ice voted for has adversely
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
affected certain cigar bars in our state
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
and forced them to modify their
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
businesses in order to not to lose their
 
01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.430 align:start position:0%
businesses in order to not to lose their
licenses

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
and uh you know he he i communicated
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
with him in an email especially in
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
september of last year he mentioned that
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
a specific nashua cigar bar i'm not
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
going to mention the business by name
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
right now but i
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
later on if you want i can share the
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
email to support his assertion
 
01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
along with the challenges of the coven
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
19 pandemic which is we all know has
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
negatively impact many bars restaurants
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
and hotels
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
he believes that state government should
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
be revising some of the provisions of
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 392 so as to allow cigar bars
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
to compete with other eating and
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
drinking establishments
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
also he believes that revising the cigar
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
bar law would allow our constituents to
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
gather in such establishments of their
 
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.630 align:start position:0%
gather in such establishments of their
choice

01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
reduce roadside litter which is an
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
environment i'm very concerned about as
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
well as generate a little bit more
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
revenue in cigar and liquor sales now as
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
you may understand from reading the
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
provisions of 12 house bill 1237 it is a
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
temporary revision of house bill 392
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
a temporary revision of our of the
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
current 13 year
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
cigar bar law that would reduce the
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
revenue requirement in half for two
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
years only
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
if house bill 1230 37 became law and
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
state government discovered it wasn't
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
helping cigar bars
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
reducing roadside litter and cruising
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
revenue then we could always return to
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
the original provisions of house bill
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
392. in fact this legislature would have
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
to approve additional legislation either
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
as a separate bill or an amendment to
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
existing bills in order to keep house
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill 1237 as written
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i just want to close with criminis
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
of information i'm not a user of cigars
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
or other tobacco products of any kind i
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
don't frequent bars
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
including cigar guards on a regular
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
basis generally i do like my light
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
consumption of alcohol beverages at home
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
normally this isn't the type of bill i
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
would sponsor
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
along with representative stapleton my
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor but i believe my constituent
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
has raised some important concerns about
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
our present cigar bar law
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
therefore i urge this committee to give
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
careful consideration of house bill 1237
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
hey representative bartlett thanks very
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
much mr chair
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
good morning representative morning
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
would you please detail how reducing the
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
revenue from cigar bars would reduce
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
roadside litter
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
well mike my constituent again in his
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
email he's mentioned he's seen since the
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
the the passage of this law and
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
especially since the pandemic he sees an
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
increase of bottles and cans along our
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
roadsides and in claremont and i i guess
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state this is what he
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me i don't know
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
for the question main choir um please
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
elaborate you you're repeating what he
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
said to you but he must have given you a
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
reason of why there's more bottles and
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
cans on the side
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i i think because people
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
are not you know and it's it's partly
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic and the emergency
 
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic and the emergency
restrictions

01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh do you know the emer but basically
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
people have been gathering those those
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
places so instead
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
they're going in in private homes or
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
even they're out and i know in my air
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
which is a very rural area of our state
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
people do a lot of drinking in the cra
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
and out you know outdoors especially
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
people maybe even younger people who
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't be drinking anyway
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
and they're going along and they're
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
going out in the woods and parks boat
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
landings et cetera i know from this
 
01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.189 align:start position:0%
landings et cetera i know from this
experience

01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know that that that especially our
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
younger people do this they really
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't be doing it but and
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
some of them are adults probably who can
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
legally drink but they don't really have
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of places these days because of
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
and so the roadside this is and i can i
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
can believe it myself
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
further and quieter thanks very much
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
so you're saying there's a direct result
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
between the reduction of the
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
revenue in a cigar bar and the
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
roadside litter
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
and that this is going to solve the
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
problem okay it will not it is just one
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
facet i think we need to do a lot of
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
things which probably you know i don't
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
want to get off on other bills and other
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
subjects it's a tough one to prove
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right i see your point
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
yes i can hear go ahead please
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
i i have not myself uh my as i said
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh i uh to be honest with you i have not

cigar bars
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
in earlier years
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%

you're speaking for your constituent but
 
01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:32.470 align:start position:0%
you're speaking for your constituent but
but

01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
if if this committee decided that they
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
that it was necessary to
 
01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
that it was necessary to
uh

01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.950 align:start position:0%
uh
change

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:41.910 align:start position:0%
change
uh

01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
either the license or the tax situation
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
or something what do you think would be
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
the effect
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
depending on what how the the tax and
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the situation the
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
state level right not the federal level
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
representatives yes at the state level
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
because obviously the federal could do
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
something and
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do that much about it if if
 
01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.350 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do that much about it if if
we

01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
change some of the state taxes i would
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
assume maybe their revenue would go up
 
01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.310 align:start position:0%
assume maybe their revenue would go up
some

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
liquor revenue some and i realize preem
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
i guess non-premium and premium are
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
taxed and i don't think preems and i'll
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
admit i'm a little confused about that
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
but they're taxed differently as i
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
understand it so that's
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
that aspect you know i think it's uh may
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
not be affected but i uh some changes in
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
our tax laws
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
and exemptions for you know might
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
increase the revenue but i put this
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
forward because of a concern about this
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
bill which which i supported by the way
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear i have nothing
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
against it in principle but i think it's
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
good from time after 13 years we take a
 
01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:44.629 align:start position:0%
good from time after 13 years we take a
look

01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
at the cigar bar law see if it's working
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
if it's working fine you can itl this
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill if it's not working you know maybe
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
you ought to take this bill and i trust
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of the committee to maybe i
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe make the whatever
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
change any of the cons items you see fit
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
but at least
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
i would say hope this committee would do
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
a study of the cigar bar law see if it's
 
01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:11.189 align:start position:0%
a study of the cigar bar law see if it's
working

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
and at least
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know if something if it's
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
let's say the itl i can always tell mike
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature tried
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know looked at your your concern but
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
it felt it was it was working properly
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
but if it it is not working properly
 
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.350 align:start position:0%
but if it it is not working properly
then

01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
i feel that you know some changes ought
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
to be in mind because i try to
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
in in filing bills and i file a number
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
of bills that requ constituents request
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
because i think that's part of my duty
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
as a representative and some of them
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
pass some of them don't
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh but i think i'm i'm trying to be open
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
here and i want to in my closing
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
statement this is not normally the type
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
of bill i would sponsor but my
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
constituent in his email mate and i also
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
asked him to submit written testimony by
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%

01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.229 align:start position:0%
committee if you want
uh

01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%

oversees the administration within the
 
01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.510 align:start position:0%
oversees the administration within the

we're here jointly to speak to this bill
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
lieutenant culver
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
has a great deal of data
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
which might be of interest to the
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee if there are follow-up
 
01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.430 align:start position:0%
committee if there are follow-up
questions

01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
in opposition and we don't generally
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
come out and oppose policy questions but
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is uh represents a potential change
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
to the way that
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
the state policy is around alcohol
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
granted covid was difficult for many
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
many businesses
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
but it didn't prompt a significant
 
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
number of requests to change the
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility laws for those businesses
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
simply because of the pandemic
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
we we have some concerns also that by
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
reducing the requirement from 60 to 30
 
01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:26.390 align:start position:0%
reducing the requirement from 60 to 30
percent

01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
it will bring additional businesses
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
in to that market area which is not
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily a bad thing
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
but at the end of two years
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
if they are not able to achieve the 60
 
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.550 align:start position:0%
if they are not able to achieve the 60
figure

01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
figure
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
then we are
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
setting them up for failure where we're
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to have that license probably
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
taken away
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
simply because of their failure to
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
maintain the eligibility standards
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
associated with the law
 
01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.310 align:start position:0%
associated with the law
so

01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
we would recommend and request
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
that the statute remain as it is
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
without making this change
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
oversees

01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
oversees
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
the quarterly inspections of these
 
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.950 align:start position:0%
the quarterly inspections of these
businesses

01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
and he can speak very directly to
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
the points about eligibility how how

good morning thank you mr chairman and

fellow uh committee members
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
currently in the state of new hampshire
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%

only one of those
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
licensees are not currently in
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
compliance with this 60 percent

quarterly gross revenue
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh requirements
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
so the way the current law reads is
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of the quarterly gross
 
01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.910 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of the quarterly gross
revenue

01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
has to come from
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
cigars or cigar related products cigar
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
related products are specifically
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
defined by statute and they include
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
six items
 
01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:11.830 align:start position:0%
six items
cigars

01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
cigars
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
cigar boxes
 
01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.149 align:start position:0%
cigar boxes
humidors

01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes so there's six items there uh
 
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:24.709 align:start position:0%
uh yes so there's six items there uh
and

01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
that quarterly gross revenue
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
has to meet the sixty percent
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
requirement anything else that they sell
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
um in their businesses actually works
 
01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.950 align:start position:0%
um in their businesses actually works
against

01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
the 60 requirement right so if you were
 
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:38.709 align:start position:0%
the 60 requirement right so if you were
to

01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
let's say sell a thousand dollars worth
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
in your business
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
600 of that would have to come from
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
cigars or cigar related products
 
01:30:50.639 --> 01:30:51.830 align:start position:0%
cigars or cigar related products
so

01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements for each of
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
the licensees uh
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
done on a quarterly basis so that each
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
quarter every three months licensees
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
submit to the division of enforcement
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh the quarterly reports for the
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
previous quarter
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
in that we determine
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
what those figures are and what they
 
01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:16.229 align:start position:0%
what those figures are and what they
represent

01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
our auditing department examines those
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
examines invoices that come in examines
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
the sales that have come out and how
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
those sales have been recorded that
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
determines their 60 percent requirement
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
now if they're not in compliance we work
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
with the licensees to bring them back
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
into compliance and we certainly have
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
done that
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
very it monitored that very closely over
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
the last year
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
or more depending on
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
the significance of violations that have
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
been occurring so currently again we
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
only have one that is not meeting the
 
01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.350 align:start position:0%
only have one that is not meeting the
ratio

01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
ratio
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
on uh the cigar bars um another point to
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
make uh
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
and it was brought up earlier in
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
reference to the pandemic the division
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
of enforcement has worked very closely
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
with the licensees not only during the
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic when when emergency orders were
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
in place but afterwards getting the uh
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
industry back up and running to where it
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
is now
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
in regards to revenue
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last four years
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
the cigar bar revenue has stayed pretty
 
01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.790 align:start position:0%
the cigar bar revenue has stayed pretty
flat

01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
flat
 
01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.910 align:start position:0%
flat
in

01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
fact in 2020 we saw a slight increase
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
during the heat of the pandemic
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
to 14 632 dollars generated from the
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
cigar bar licenses
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
the specific issue regarding the tax
 
01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:41.110 align:start position:0%
the specific issue regarding the tax
exemption

01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
on the cigar bars
 
01:32:42.719 --> 01:32:43.510 align:start position:0%
on the cigar bars
is

01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
statutes in the in
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
through dra
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
that exempt
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
premium cigars premium cigars through
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
their statutes are specifically

01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
so is the premium cigar included in the
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
dollar sales numbers it is for our
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and for
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
coming before the committee
 
01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
coming before the committee
the

01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
the one
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
not to be named licensee that's out of
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
compliance uh by what degree are they
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
out of compliance
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
what degree um
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have the specific figures in in
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
front of me
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
he's asking he's answering the question
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
oh is it by a little bit or a lot
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
it it's around the 10 to 15 percent
 
01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:01.910 align:start position:0%
it it's around the 10 to 15 percent
so

01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
10 to 15
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
we have three that are closely working
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
with uh the division of enforcement
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
right now in the licensing unit the in
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
the our auditing unit um that are
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
floating right around the sixty percent
 
01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
floating right around the sixty percent
so

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.189 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the intent of
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
cigar bars and giving them the license
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
to sell liquor was that it should not it
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
was is a is a service but it should not
 
01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.310 align:start position:0%
was is a is a service but it should not
actually

01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
fundamentally affect their
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
business of selling
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
cigars and
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
pipe you know
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
pipes and whatever else they sell so
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
that if they were to lose their license
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
then they would just be a cigar
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
establishment which is what the original
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's what their business plan is
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chairman and yes i i
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
believe the original intent of the cigar
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
bar license was for retail cigar
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
locations to
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
have the privilege of selling a beverage
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
to their patronage as they enjoy their
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
cigar within their establishment
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
perspective that we have seen
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
over the last year or so
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
new licensees who are struggling with
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
compliance issues are utilizing their
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
license for which it was not intended
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
and that by far
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
is the vast minority of the licensees
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
again there's 15 only one is currently
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
not in compliance
 
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.669 align:start position:0%
not in compliance

thank you for allowing me to testify in
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%

enforcement and licensing

hb 1591 fn
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
contains similar language except for the
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
abolishment of the 20 liquor
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
investigators that appeared
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
in the house version of hb one and two
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's the budget bills last year
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%

positions

01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
to licensed specialists
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
the idea to eliminate the liquor
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
investigator positions within the liquor
 
01:38:08.239 --> 01:38:09.270 align:start position:0%
investigator positions within the liquor
commission

01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
is due in large part to liquor
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
commission's disregard to years of
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
well-documented concerns
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
these concerns are from the office of
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant lba
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
the joint legislative fiscal committee
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
the house finance committee
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
legislators and many others because the
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
division fails to reflect
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
its true roles and responsibilities
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
when created in its present form in 2009
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
the division was and i quote
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
to optimize profitability
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
maintain proper control
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
effectively and efficiently operate
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
and to provide service to customers
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
last year mr chairman
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
another audit of the enforcement
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
division presented to the fiscal
 
01:39:04.159 --> 01:39:05.109 align:start position:0%
division presented to the fiscal
committee

01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
again identified very troubling findings
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
many of these findings have been
 
01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.870 align:start position:0%
many of these findings have been
identified

01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the joint fiscal committee
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
in years past and remain unresolved
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
some are more than a decade old
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
the lack of transparency
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
and the willingness of the liquor
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
commission to provide requested
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
information as a regulated agency has
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
been well documented in this the latest
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
audit and previous audits i believe last
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
week we had all the audits delivered to
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
one of the roles of the joint
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee is to
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
oversee and review financial and
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
performance audits of all state agencies
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
the latest performance audit
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
again february
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
of this last year which you should have
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
received last week
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
contains many disturbing behaviors by
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
the enforcement division
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
when the lba suggested increasing
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
oversight by the legislature
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission responded
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
we do not concur
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
for instance the commission has not
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
provided the agreed upon quarterly
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
reports detailing extra
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
judicial enforcement
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional enforcement i'm sorry
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
compromising transparency and ethical
 
01:40:39.679 --> 01:40:41.910 align:start position:0%
compromising transparency and ethical
behavior

01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
the commission would rather provide
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
narratives rationalizing the
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
division's extra jurisdictional
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
activities such as this establishing of
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
sobriety checkpoints saturation patrols
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
or investigating motor vehicle
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
violations by investigators
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
the lba found and i quote
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
the division expanded its scope of
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
operation actively moving away from
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
regulation in licensees and permittees
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
and moving towards general policing of
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
the broader segment of society
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of hb 1591
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
believe the commission should focus on
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
its statutory obligations
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
legally delegated authority and leave
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
general policing and enforcement to such
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies such as the new
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
the lack of transparency in the behavior
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the liquor commission should concern
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
us all
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
since in this latest case the liquor
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
commission has again demonstrated for
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
more than another decade an
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
unwillingness to participate in the
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
oversight process
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
we are obligated to the citizens
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
of this state
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
to make essential changes on how the
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
liquor commission operates and i
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
did print out
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
my written testimony which i certainly
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
 
01:42:22.239 --> 01:42:25.350 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
questions

01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%

speak to us because
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that kind of surprised
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
some of us um
 
01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:37.990 align:start position:0%

when i look at the sponsors i'm
 
01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.830 align:start position:0%
when i look at the sponsors i'm
wondering

01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.390 align:start position:0%
wondering

to me i don't know all of the members on
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee but this is a
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill can you tell me if all
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
of these sponsors are on the fiscal

during last year's budget process all
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
funding for the division was eliminated
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 23.
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
the police duties of the division
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
duplicate those of local and state
 
01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.270 align:start position:0%
duplicate those of local and state
police

01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
this bill merely cleans up the
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
references to the vision as they
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
currently appear in our laws
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
and bring those brings those laws into
 
01:44:28.159 --> 01:44:29.109 align:start position:0%
and bring those brings those laws into
line

01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal reality on the ground
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
the training division and all its
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
functions remain under this bill
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
the act
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
the action of finance one
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
was bipartisan
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
and a rare opportunity to save the state
 
01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.390 align:start position:0%
and a rare opportunity to save the state
money

01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
with a minimum of consequences
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
most of the members of the enforcement
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
division are qualified police and have
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
been through training for police
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
and with the current employment
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
situation there are many opportunities
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
for them to remain in their chosen field
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
with either state or local police
 
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
the action of finance was in part driven
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
by recent audit reports of our liquor
 
01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.229 align:start position:0%
by recent audit reports of our liquor
operations

01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
i joined the legislature in 2016
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
and during that term i got to read the
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
then current audit report
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
i was shocked at the deficiencies and
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
the amount of work that would be
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
required to fix them
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
i was even more shocked when i returned
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
to the legislature in 2020
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
to find a brand new audit report that
 
01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:39.270 align:start position:0%
to find a brand new audit report that
showed

01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
showed
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
little progress had been made
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
i ask that the committee join with us in
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
support of this bipartisan bill
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
um before you go just
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
humor me i guess is can you give me one
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
example of what you were really shocked
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
about that they have not addressed yet
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's been some time
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
since i read those reports
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
and i would really refer any committee
 
01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:15.109 align:start position:0%
and i would really refer any committee
member

01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
the deficiencies to read those reports
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
go off the top of my head i don't have
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
the report i thought maybe you had one
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
salient item that you could really say
 
01:46:28.639 --> 01:46:30.629 align:start position:0%
salient item that you could really say
boy

01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
boy
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
it was there in the old the first report
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%

01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%

i became a member of the bureau of
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%

and i cannot tell you how strongly i am
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to this
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
bill some of the legislation and chief
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
armageddon will speak but i just want to
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
make make you aware that
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
some of the provisions of this bill
 
01:47:58.639 --> 01:47:59.590 align:start position:0%
some of the provisions of this bill
make

01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.109 align:start position:0%
make
no

01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
do not provide a pathway
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
to the elimination of these positions
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the proposed savings that are
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to come from
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
um if all of these people are going to
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
be eliminated
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
then there is going to be a projected
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
savings about two and a half million
 
01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:18.390 align:start position:0%
savings about two and a half million
dollars

01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
but there's also
 
01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.950 align:start position:0%
but there's also
a

01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
need to re-hire people
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
to serve
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
in a civilian capacity
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
plus the
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislature must pay the specialist for
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
two years under the personnel rules
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
as well as payouts which are going to be
 
01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:37.830 align:start position:0%
as well as payouts which are going to be
approximately

01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
over six hundred thousand dollars for
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
these people to leave
 
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.950 align:start position:0%
these people to leave
so

01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
the savings is really not going to be
 
01:48:44.719 --> 01:48:46.950 align:start position:0%
the savings is really not going to be
recognized

01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
as it's
 
01:48:48.239 --> 01:48:49.590 align:start position:0%

01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
i've been here four years prior to that
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
the previous 28 years i was a commander
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
for the state police
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
and in several different capacities had
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
commands from
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
units to troops to bureaus to field
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
areas one of them being this building
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
and the troop area that covers the
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
capital area to include regulatory units
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
within the troop are within the state
 
01:49:51.679 --> 01:49:52.790 align:start position:0%
within the troop are within the state
police

01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
um within my 34 years of law enforcement
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
i've been deemed and it's hard for me to
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
say because i am a humble person uh i'm
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
a fixer i'm a doer
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
and if you need something fixed
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
let's do it and that's what we did with
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
this division and i put five minutes
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
down on my card but it's going to take
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
me a little longer than that i will
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
provide some written documentation
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
to educate each and every one of you
 
01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:22.550 align:start position:0%
to educate each and every one of you
thoroughly

01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
on what this division has done in the
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
last four years the restructure of this
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
division the audit that happened
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
two months after i walked in the door
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
and didn't even have a chance to fix
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
anything and we'll talk about that also
 
01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:38.629 align:start position:0%
anything and we'll talk about that also
um

01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
you will hear a little bit those of you
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
that know me you'll hear a little bit
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
more directness than you've heard from
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
me in the past
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
because not only is this frustrating but
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's irritating this is a dangerous bill
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's dangerous to our communities it's
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
dangerous to the agency uh the uh
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
industry that it regulates and to be
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
quite frank it endangers the welfare of
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
our children in this state that we look
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
out for on a daily basis and if those of
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
those people that want to support this
 
01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:09.830 align:start position:0%
those people that want to support this
bill

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
stick by their guns with it they are
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
literally flying in the face of what
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
i've just said
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
back in 2018
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
when we walked in and we restructured
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
this division
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
we changed the face of the command staff
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
there is not one command staff left for
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
those of you that have been around a
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
little while there's not one command
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
staff left
 
01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
staff left
in

01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
the command structure of this division
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
the back of the house our investigators
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
have been changed the demeanor has been
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
changed the mission has been redirected
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
with view with purpose and with mission
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
to at the end of the day
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing business better than i hate
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
my one of my predecessors sitting next
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
to me but we're doing better than our
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
predecessors have done business
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you that we are
 
01:52:05.199 --> 01:52:06.550 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you that we are
probably

01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
i'd say three months away from being
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
kalia accredited
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
one of 18 accredited law enforcement
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state one of only two in
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
the country that are regulatory abc
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
alcohol beverage and control
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
we have achieved that mark through
 
01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.629 align:start position:0%
we have achieved that mark through
audits

01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
audits
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
and through showing our policies and
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
procedures that we're doing everything
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
the way we should be doing at an ultra
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
high level
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
compared to the
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
the agencies that are in this state
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
that literally are perceived
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
as the pinnacle of law enforcement
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
whether federal or state
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
we are doing it better
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
because there is a vested interest in
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
doing it better
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
so if i could go through this
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
piece by piece i i have provided
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
or i will be providing
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
written documentation to break down for
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
each and every one of you
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
what has transpired in the last four
 
01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
what has transpired in the last four
years

01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
and it will give you a view of what
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be doing in the
 
01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:21.350 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be doing in the
future

01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
as i said in 2018 we restructured
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
we actually aligned our supervision to
 
01:53:28.159 --> 01:53:29.350 align:start position:0%
we actually aligned our supervision to
have

01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
one-on-one control over the
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
investigators and and auditors in the
 
01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:35.430 align:start position:0%
investigators and and auditors in the
field

01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
not only did that give us
 
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
more accountability better
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
accountability but it made it more
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
efficient and more effective as we move
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
forward we went from a revenue footprint
 
01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
18.3 million to today 19.5 million
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
because of oversight
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
we are generating revenue for the state
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
at the same time we have industry
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
supporting us because we have opened up
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
lines of communication that
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
have are
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
beyond what anybody would perceive and
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
believe would happen between a
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency and the people that
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
they regulate we have a bond a network
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
in a support group that you will hear
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
testimony from that support this
 
01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.229 align:start position:0%
testimony from that support this
division

01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
being in existence and having oversight
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
over their industry
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
they should be the first ones sitting at
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
the table saying we don't want it and
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
they're here
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
backing us why because when they call us
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
we answer the call when they have
 
01:54:47.599 --> 01:54:48.790 align:start position:0%
we answer the call when they have
questions

01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
our customer service is is paramount
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
and it's beyond reproach
 
01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
they call on the weekends we respond and
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that i know a lot of you
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
have reached out to me with different
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions over the years and and even in
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
this capacity i have not heard from one
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor on this bill
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
not one
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
except for when i sit in front of fiscal
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
and get told of stuff that happened 10
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
that i am not responsible for and when
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
reading the audit and everybody will
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
point out the audit but everybody misses
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
the second page of the executive summary
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
of that audit in in the seventh and
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
eighth paragraph buried
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
in that audit says that the current
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
administration is not responsible for
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
the shortfalls
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
and they are responsible for
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
implementing efficiencies and
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
effectiveness in their in their
 
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
beginning stages of course
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
we were just walking in the door when
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
this audit started
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
it was only published in 2021
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry yes 2021
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
when actually
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
look at what has been completed and what
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
has been presented
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i will follow up on this
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative because i don't know what
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
isn't making it to you
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
what has been presented
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
to fiscal
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
is that we are at walking in the door
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
when it was presented we were at 84
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
completed on 47 observations
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
we at this point are at 92 percent
 
01:56:28.639 --> 01:56:30.149 align:start position:0%
we at this point are at 92 percent
completed

01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
completed
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
when you ask the auditors how long does
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
it take you to do 47 observations
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you five years
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
we did not do that in nine months
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
we did it because we were working on it
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
since 2018 and we're changing the way we
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
did business
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
why because you asked for it our
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
citizens asked for it the industry asked
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
for it and to be quite frank about it
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's the way we keep our kids safe in
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
this state is with oversight
 
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.350 align:start position:0%
this state is with oversight
so

01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
when when i hear of
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
some of this stuff last week with the
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional uh
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill that was brought up and i hear
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
high-speed pursuits
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
and late night raids
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
i question where they come from and i
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
get the same answer
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
a constituent told me
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
i like to know who that person is
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
i like to know why sitting here is the
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
first time that i hear about stuff when
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
my phone number is available to
 
01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.430 align:start position:0%
my phone number is available to
everybody

01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
i will handle it if we do business wrong
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
but we're not
 
01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:39.669 align:start position:0%
but we're not
so

01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'm kind by saying misinformation
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
because there are some fabrications that
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
are out there also and when i find out
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
about them i address them but at the end
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
i want you to be assured here
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%

quarterly
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
on what might be
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
perceived as extra jurisdictional
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
they are life safety issues
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you that
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
in any other forum
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
what is perceived as extra
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional life safety i'll give you
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
an example
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%

what ended up happening late night as
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
one of our investigators was driving
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
back to
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
our store street
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
headquarters he was behind a car
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
at that traffic light and the car went
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
through a cycle of lights
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
and the car wasn't moving so a stop was
 
01:58:53.199 --> 01:58:54.790 align:start position:0%
and the car wasn't moving so a stop was
initiated

01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
initiated
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
he walked up to the car to see a woman
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
slumped over the wheel of the car she
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
was oding
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%

01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
and try to save that woman's life
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's perceived as a extra
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional item
 
01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
there are people there are law
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%

for saving somebody's life and we are
sick

01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
sick
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
we are sitting before you
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
because we are criticized for life
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
safety issues
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
cars they have driven off the road while
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh inspect one of our licenses set um
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
establishments when we do that
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
we are only doing that to check on a
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
life safety issue
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
state police headquarters is then called
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
and a trooper shows up for it
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
we are not doing extra jurisdictional
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
items we are doing things we are doing
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
the job within the purview of the
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
authority that this body has given us
 
02:00:12.390 --> 02:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
that we report to constantly
 
02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:13.669 align:start position:0%
that we report to constantly
quarterly

02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
on extra jurisdictional items since two
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
what i also want i
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
want you to know is that
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
the this is an unfunded mandate toward
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
the local departments and municipalities
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
with the consistency of our unit
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
not being out there you will you will
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
take away number one the administrative
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
process so everybody is dealt with
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
infractions are dealt with by
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or felony
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
not an administrative finding
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
of as most of you know
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
begins with
 
02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:09.270 align:start position:0%
begins with
our

02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
education platform
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
educating everybody
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
and moving up through
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
of course accountability
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
it's a progressive way of doing
 
02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:21.750 align:start position:0%
it's a progressive way of doing
accountability

02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:01:24.149 --> 02:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
not going for the jugular right off the
 
02:01:24.159 --> 02:01:25.030 align:start position:0%
not going for the jugular right off the
bat

02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
bat
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
we pro we we regulate this industry
 
02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:29.589 align:start position:0%
we pro we we regulate this industry
to

02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
a level of industry
 
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
and community safety we don't over uh
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
regulate it we don't under regulate it
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
after four years
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
education we have had 700 even through a
 
02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.830 align:start position:0%

pandemic
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
or the nucleus of the pandemic because i
 
02:01:57.149 --> 02:01:57.159 align:start position:0%

maybe three million
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
we've almost hit half of those in four
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
years educating them on the misuses of
 
02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.149 align:start position:0%

on the misuses of alcohol
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
i can only say that our prevention
 
02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:33.109 align:start position:0%
i can only say that our prevention
partners

02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
partners
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
who you will hear from do not support
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
this and we have a great relationship
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
with them
 
02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:39.910 align:start position:0%
with them
again

02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
the industry that we regulate whether
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
grocers restaurant and lodging
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
and i know i'm going to forget somebody
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
they support us the chiefs
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
support us
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
the sheriffs support us
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
the people in your communities
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
the parents in your communities support
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
if you hear
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
anything that doesn't make sense to you
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
please pick up the phone call mark and
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
ask me
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
there are fallacies out there there's
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations out there and at the
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
end of the day it gets pretty disgusting
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
that somebody has to go to those levels
 
02:03:29.589 --> 02:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
to take shots at us
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
with that i apologize that i do have a
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
passion for this work
 
02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't leave
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
state police because i was disgruntled
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
i saw an opportunity to change the way
 
02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
business was done with with liquor
 
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement and we have done it
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
and with that in mind
 
02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:50.149 align:start position:0%
and with that in mind
um

02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know was there a question asked
 
02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
asked i'm sorry
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh with that in mind
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
i will take any questions
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
whether on this job or another job
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
okay representative bartlett has a
 
02:04:06.079 --> 02:04:06.870 align:start position:0%
okay representative bartlett has a
question

02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair and thanks for
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
coming and um
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
talking to us about these issues
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
um i think one of the things that we
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
have a tough time balancing is that
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
as a legislature we have a
 
02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:20.709 align:start position:0%
as a legislature we have a
responsibility

02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
to look at the finances of every
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
division and the liquor commission
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
certainly is a revenue producing
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
division but it has expenses as well
 
02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
division but it has expenses as well
um

02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
i think that you would agree that it is
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
fair that there is an audit done on a
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
fairly regular basis of any
 
02:04:39.119 --> 02:04:40.470 align:start position:0%
fairly regular basis of any
agency

02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
but i also think that um
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
the timing
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
that as you point out is terribly
 
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
important that you had just come into
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
the the job
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
though it had been about six years since
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
the previous audit when you came in and
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
there were still
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
open items that you were trying to
 
02:05:00.719 --> 02:05:01.990 align:start position:0%
open items that you were trying to
address

02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass or to be
 
02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:09.910 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass or to be
amended

02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
amended
 
02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:11.109 align:start position:0%
amended
um

02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
would it be fair and i'm i you know this
 
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
is going to go to subcommittee because
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
there's going to be lots more questions
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
about all of this but would it be fair
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
to extend
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill for say two
 
02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:24.149 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill for say two
years

02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
that would have given you about six
 
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.189 align:start position:0%
that would have given you about six
years

02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
to implement the changes that you wanted
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
to make
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
that would address some of the
 
02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:34.709 align:start position:0%
that would address some of the
enforcement

02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
um and you know issues that came up by
 
02:05:37.199 --> 02:05:38.310 align:start position:0%
um and you know issues that came up by
audit

02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
audit
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
um we're trying
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
like i said we're trying to balance
 
02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
our responsibility with what your
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
division does which is a very important
 
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
division not only to this agency i mean
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
to this committee
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
but certainly to the state absolutely
 
02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your question and
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
great to see you representative um
 
02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.510 align:start position:0%
great to see you representative um
i

02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
i would respectfully just disagree with
 
02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:02.950 align:start position:0%
i would respectfully just disagree with
that

02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
for for a couple of reasons
 
02:06:05.119 --> 02:06:06.390 align:start position:0%
for for a couple of reasons
um

02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
number one
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
revenue wise
 
02:06:09.599 --> 02:06:12.069 align:start position:0%
revenue wise
we

02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
we operated on a 4.2 4.3
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
million dollar budget
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
in the division and generate just short
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
of 20 million dollars
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
that is done because of the men and
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
women women that are on the sworn side
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
of the house along with
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
the men and women that are on the
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
auditing side of the house
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
if we lose
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
though first of all you can't just
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
civilianize those positions of course as
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
you know and in those law enforcement
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
officers who
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
have bought into and and are educated in
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
a career field
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
just say okay i'm going to be a civilian
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
now they're going to stay in law
 
02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement which was brought up it
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
definitely was brought up um
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
we have found that
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has actually in creating
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
positions which was brought up
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
has brought
 
02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.599 --> 02:07:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
employees

02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
closer to us we're not a stepping stone
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're actually an agency that has people
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
within it that care about the work that
 
02:07:23.830 --> 02:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
i i can't help nor speak of some of the
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
shortfalls and some of the great things
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
that have been done in in the mid to
 
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
early 90s with with uh aiden's group
 
02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
early 90s with with uh aiden's group
um

02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
and and some of the shortfalls with with
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
some of my predecessors i can't speak of
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
that we do keep bringing that up i'm not
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for that i was a homicide
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
detective when that happened
 
02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:49.990 align:start position:0%
detective when that happened
um

02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
working on some of the most egregious
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
crimes in the state
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you this
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
my my reputation precedes me
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not being arrogant by saying that
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
um i'm a fixer
 
02:08:06.229 --> 02:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
and at this point i don't think we need
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
the six years because we're at 94
 
02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:10.390 align:start position:0%
the six years because we're at 94
percent

02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
of fixing those audit
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
observations now
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
and what has been left over is is
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
actually statutor
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
statutory change and rule change
 
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
i was asked quite
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
quite recently why
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
the policies of the division
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
have been left for the last
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
to be changed we've done the 700 rolls
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
we've done the 500 rules we've done
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
1100 rules um
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
direct shipping
 
02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.910 align:start position:0%
direct shipping
um

02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
licensing auditing
 
02:08:58.159 --> 02:09:00.069 align:start position:0%
licensing auditing
um

02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:00.079 --> 02:09:00.950 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
the 600 rules are the rules that
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
actually govern
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
the enforcement the enforcement policies
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
the 200 rules which govern our
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
administrative hearings
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
the reason why they were done in that
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
order is because every one of the
 
02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:21.350 align:start position:0%
order is because every one of the
previous

02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
previous
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
rules stated
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
a series of rules actually directly
 
02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
affects the 600 and 200 rules you'll
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
keep changing those two if you do it
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
that way but what we did do and i don't
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
want anybody to think because this will
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
be thrown out there the 600 rules
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
weren't done the 600 policies on
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement weren't done
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
the for those of you that were in the
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
military or or know
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
what we would call sops our policy
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
standard operating procedures
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
those were done when i walked through
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
the door we needed to do them they
 
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
needed to be updated they were terrible
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
they they needed
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
to have position they needed to have
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
purpose and they were done right off the
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
bat the problem with this the the audit
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
was just to be quite frank about it and
 
02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:11.189 align:start position:0%
was just to be quite frank about it and
transparent

02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
i was asked to do
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
a assessment
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
a 90-day assessment when i walked in the
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
door that 90 days turned into six months
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
really quick
 
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:22.870 align:start position:0%
really quick
i

02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
by november of that year
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
i turned to the deputy and said oh my
 
02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:28.550 align:start position:0%
i turned to the deputy and said oh my
gosh

02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
gosh
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
there's so much here we need to stop we
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
need to document what we're doing we
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
need to start changing things it was
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
taking us too long
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
because we were tripping over rocks and
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
finding stuff underneath them that
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't obvious and and we started doing
 
02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:44.470 align:start position:0%
wasn't obvious and and we started doing
it

02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
i was naive
 
02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
i will say this and i i
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't say this often i was naive to
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
great work that the men and women of
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
that division did in the four or three
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
years previous to the publication
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
of that audit
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
would have been earmarked in the audit
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
but all i was told was it's outside of
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
the audit period
 
02:11:07.119 --> 02:11:07.910 align:start position:0%
the audit period
so

02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
i got two lines in the second to the
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
last in the last paragraph of the
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
executive summary that said i'm not
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for it and i've done some
 
02:11:18.639 --> 02:11:19.750 align:start position:0%
responsible for it and i've done some
stuff

02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
that that's what i got out of it and
 
02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
they pretty much and i i don't mean i
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
guess i am being facetious here
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
um my document that was given which was
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
a very brief document maybe 30 pages
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
from an ultra high level maybe a hundred
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
thousand foot level
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
um my face was shoved into my own
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
information said
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
what have you done in the last four
 
02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:44.709 align:start position:0%
what have you done in the last four
years

02:11:44.709 --> 02:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
that's what i walked into
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
i took it
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
like i should but at the end of the day
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
we're at a point now where
 
02:11:57.510 --> 02:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
we have answered in front of fiscal
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
quarter well at one point it was monthly
 
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
we've moved to quarterly
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
and and we report to you
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
in this committee quarterly and what is
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
perceived as extra there is total
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
transparency with what we do on a daily
 
02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:17.270 align:start position:0%
transparency with what we do on a daily
basis

02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
these documents are also posted on our
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
on our home page
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
as soon as you open it up
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
what we're doing for
 
02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:28.310 align:start position:0%
what we're doing for
activity

02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
activity
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
speaking of which and talking about
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory focus
 
02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
regulatory focus
through

02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
from 2019 to 2021
 
02:12:43.069 --> 02:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
the division has handled 42
 
02:12:43.079 --> 02:12:44.629 align:start position:0%
the division has handled 42
212

02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
212
 
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:48.040 align:start position:0%

02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
any of the other egregious crimes this
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
division is specialized we've been asked
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
to be specialized by the chiefs of
 
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.109 align:start position:0%
to be specialized by the chiefs of
police

02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
that are that that have oversight of the
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that a lot of you have
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
oversight of or represent
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's departments
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
and and quite frankly
 
02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
select persons and mayors throughout the
 
02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:29.189 align:start position:0%
select persons and mayors throughout the
state

02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
there there really is some of the things
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
that have been said from the past could
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
be very true they are not true
 
02:13:41.669 --> 02:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
today in 2022
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
they are not true
 
02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:45.189 align:start position:0%
they are not true
period

02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
and if anybody would like to speak to me
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%

from nothing
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
on on anything that has fallen short
 
02:14:02.229 --> 02:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
other than this audit
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
did i answer your question

have known me from testifying here over
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years know that i i this
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
this is way under my skin right now
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
we get the feeling of that yes
 
02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:25.990 align:start position:0%
we get the feeling of that yes
representative

02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you sir uh your your passion
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
um has certainly uh been uh recognized
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
in your remarks and also your
 
02:14:36.629 --> 02:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
responses uh to the to the questions
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
that have been put to you
 
02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:41.750 align:start position:0%
that have been put to you
um

02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to distill
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
02:14:46.159 --> 02:14:47.270 align:start position:0%
the difference
between

02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
you and the sponsors of the bill
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
as as i listen to everything that's
 
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
being said here and i'm wondering if
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
this would be an accurate assessment at
 
02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
this point
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
apparently there's an audit
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
and the audit covered a period of time
 
02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:06.069 align:start position:0%
and the audit covered a period of time
which

02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:15:06.079 --> 02:15:07.830 align:start position:0%
which
predates

02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
predates
 
02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:08.790 align:start position:0%
predates
your

02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
your
um

02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
your leadership of of this division is
 
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
that correct and
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm i better continue otherwise
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to keep asking for
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
permission for follow-ups
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
so um so what i've heard you say is that
 
02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:26.069 align:start position:0%
so um so what i've heard you say is that
the

02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
the deficiencies
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
and perhaps abuses or neglects or
 
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
whatever the problems that are
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
identified in that audit
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
for the for a prior period
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
have largely been addressed
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
and rectified
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
such that
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
it appears as though
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of the bill are either
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
unaware of this
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
or they just generally have a
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
philosophical difference as to how
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
things ought to be operated whether we
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
ought to have an enforcement division or
 
02:16:00.159 --> 02:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
ought to have an enforcement division or
not

02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:16:01.199 --> 02:16:02.069 align:start position:0%
not
so

02:16:02.069 --> 02:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
because i'm sorry that i that i've
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
wrapped up essentially three questions
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
in one but it has saved me from having
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
to continue to ask for permission
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh with the uh the second and third
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
part of the question so i made it abc
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
instead of one two three thank you
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative it was
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
efficient um
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
i i can i i'm going to break it down if
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
i forget a part
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh first and foremost um i i don't i
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
won't speak
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the representative and and
 
02:16:35.429 --> 02:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
it seems like division one
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
um fiscal division one um because um
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know i haven't spoken to them
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
the only person i had spoken to at the
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
time was uh
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative ober when i walked in the
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
door here
 
02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:51.990 align:start position:0%
door here
um

02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and we had a great conversation
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
and it was left at that
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
and and i told her what my focus was i
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
will tell you that um
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
the audit period fiscal 1819
 
02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
is within the time that i'm here
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal 18 i came in in
 
02:17:17.349 --> 02:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
april april 6 to be exact of 2017 two
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
months before the the audit period so i
 
02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
was learning names and processes and
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
going through my own assessment of the
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
division during the audit time
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
the deficiencies that they found and
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
they had the time to dig in the weeds
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
were the deficiencies that i found too
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
at a different level of course because
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not a full-time auditor i'm i have
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
to run a division and and and i had some
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
risk assessments to make really quick
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
um and we did that and we took on the
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
sworn part of
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
the division
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
primarily right out of the shoot because
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
that was our big biggest risk we had a
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
we had a law enforcement risk so
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
um and and a safety concern
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
so so we took it on it was the obvious
 
02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:07.910 align:start position:0%
so so we took it on it was the obvious
um

02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
at the same time um as we move forward
 
02:18:11.599 --> 02:18:12.549 align:start position:0%
at the same time um as we move forward
yes

02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're at 90
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
and and somebody can correct me here i
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
think we're at 90 between 92 and 94
 
02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:22.070 align:start position:0%
think we're at 90 between 92 and 94
completed

02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
completed
 
02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:23.190 align:start position:0%
completed
um

02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
with with the audit uh findings um
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
so so with that in mind um yes your your
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
assessment is right other than it
 
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
sounded like i wasn't here for the audit
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
period but i i was it was when i was
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
to conclude so i understand
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
so in effect
 
02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
you might be
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
understood to be saying in short
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
the solution that is being proposed for
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
cited deficiencies
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
is no longer uh needed
 
02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:00.790 align:start position:0%
is no longer uh needed
uh

02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
because you
 
02:19:05.669 --> 02:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
actually are at 94 percent with respect
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
to addressing the deficiencies that this
 
02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
remedy by
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
eliminating the enforcement division
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's thank you very much sir thank you
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:19:27.030 --> 02:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:29.429 --> 02:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
could you help me understand um
 
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
is it true that
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
the line items for your division were
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
they removed in whole or in part
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
and if so how are you operating
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh going forward if
 
02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
your division is not financed in
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
those positions were removed those light
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
line items were removed and they were
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
put placed back in again
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
so in the committee conference report
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead yes sir
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
what kind of arrests
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
does the liquor commission need to be
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
able to make that cannot be done by
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
state police at the request of and with
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
evidence provided by the liquor
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
commission after having obtained a
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
warrant by a judge and how many of these
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
arrests are made every year
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't have my arrest numbers um
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
if you civilianize
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh the division
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's statute that actually
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
um allows police officers to transfer
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
probable cause to each other
 
02:20:48.399 --> 02:20:49.349 align:start position:0%
probable cause to each other
um

02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
if they are not law enforcement officers
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
they are witnesses
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
like any other civilian
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
so at that point it hampers
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of an investigation
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
to the point where time as you know time
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
is of the essence in a lot of these
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
investigations and and we're not talking
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
small investigations
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
as you've seen on the news we're talking
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
death resulting
 
02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.429 align:start position:0%
death resulting
investigations

02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
where the state police in state police
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
keeps being mentioned here
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
and believe me the state police is very
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
fond to me of course i spent my whole
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
state police and death resulting crashes
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
as they
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
relate to our licensed establishment
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
will defer to us
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
because the mindset is
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
we because we specialize
 
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.190 align:start position:0%
we because we specialize
in

02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
navigating through our licensed
 
02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:48.309 align:start position:0%
navigating through our licensed
establishments

02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
they would rather have us do it
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
and ascertain documentation and and
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
evidence then them do it
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
follow just for clarification for the
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
question may include thank you so just
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
by having sworn officers as part of the
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
liquor commission it is so for the
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
obtaining of evidence that could be used
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
in criminal prosecution as opposed to
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
eyewitness testimony
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
so so there's rules of evidence there's
 
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
chain of custody there's
 
02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:24.150 align:start position:0%
chain of custody there's
okay

02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you perfect thank you
 
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:27.990 align:start position:0%

uh see none thank you very much
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh so i uh dawned on me that these uh
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
reports were in our committee room from
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
last week
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
and uh everybody had already gone home
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
when i saw them so that's why they're
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
being distributed now
 
02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
so you now have you now have the audits
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
that are being referred to
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
good quality reading
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
so everyone will have a chance to read
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
up on them before we do the subcommittee
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
next week
 
02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:01.190 align:start position:0%
next week
okay

02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:02.309 align:start position:0%
okay

and primarily in two parts
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
one part
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
is that at the end of the day
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
if something like this was done
 
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
what the industry wouldn't want to see
 
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
happen is that
 
02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:04.389 align:start position:0%
happen is that
uh

02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
the enforcement rule
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh just uh be transferred from
 
02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:11.429 align:start position:0%
uh just uh be transferred from
the

02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:24:11.439 --> 02:24:13.670 align:start position:0%
the
plainclothes

02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
plainclothes
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement folks at the
 
02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:17.110 align:start position:0%
enforcement folks at the
commission

02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:17.910 align:start position:0%
commission
to

02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
uniform either state or local officers
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're a hospitality industry
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
and i think folks have a concern
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
with you know
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
the hospitality atmosphere of uniformed
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement folks
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
and that is not to say that the
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
state and local enforcement folks don't
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
do a good job at what they do
 
02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:44.230 align:start position:0%
do a good job at what they do
the

02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
the uniformed uh officer in the back
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
chief goldstein does a great job uh for
 
02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:52.070 align:start position:0%
chief goldstein does a great job uh for
franklin

02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
franklin
 
02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:53.510 align:start position:0%
franklin
but

02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
again it's it's the it's the hospitality
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
atmosphere that we're trying to provide
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
and um and i would additionally say that
 
02:25:02.479 --> 02:25:03.349 align:start position:0%
and um and i would additionally say that
um

02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i think uh uh chief farmer gaden
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
touched on it um
 
02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
when there
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
are issues uh when maybe a licensee
 
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
felt that the approach
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
that the enforcement folks took that his
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
team took
 
02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:20.469 align:start position:0%
team took
um

02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
i will say that mike summers who's
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
president association who's planning to
 
02:25:26.389 --> 02:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
be here today but he couldn't um always
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
picks up the phone
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh and speaks uh with the chief
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
armageddon and it's nice to have
 
02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:33.830 align:start position:0%
armageddon and it's nice to have
one

02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
person really to reach out to
 
02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:36.830 align:start position:0%
person really to reach out to
again

02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
if the enforcement was then disbursed to
 
02:25:42.309 --> 02:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
state and local
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh folks
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other relationships
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
that i think mike would have to develop
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
to talk about maybe the approach
 
02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:50.710 align:start position:0%
to talk about maybe the approach
that

02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
those officials were taking um so
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
i would say that they are uh responsive
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh where there have been
 
02:25:58.160 --> 02:25:59.190 align:start position:0%
uh where there have been
uh

02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know instances where maybe the
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
approach of uh his team
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh wasn't right uh he he's been
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
responsive so um
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
those are basically the concerns we have
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
so if you were to move in this direction
 
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh i think just be cautious
 
02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:19.429 align:start position:0%
uh i think just be cautious
because

02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you know
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
the devil we know is
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
we prefer that than the devil we don't
 
02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:28.870 align:start position:0%
we prefer that than the devil we don't
know

02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
any other no questions thank you very
 
02:26:35.110 --> 02:26:35.120 align:start position:0%

02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes yeah you have to pull pull it pretty
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
close yeah
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yes okay
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chair and the
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
is dr sai charala i'm from the division
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
of public health i'm the bureau chief
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
for the population health i'm here
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
representing the department of health
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
and human services and we are in
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
opposition for this bill
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
just to give you the background
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill has currently written will
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
have long term consequences for our
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
underage sale for tobacco
 
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
our underage use for tobacco alcohol and
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
liquor and it also will impact our
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
prevention and treatment resources for
 
02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:48.630 align:start position:0%
prevention and treatment resources for
our

02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
for our mental health and substance use
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
so just to give you the background i
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
just want to start with numbers because
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
we love members
 
02:27:56.319 --> 02:27:57.750 align:start position:0%
we love members
so

02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we have around 9 out of
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
10 smokers who start smoking at the
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
even before the age by age of 18. so
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the very younger age
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the start and once you have this and
 
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
especially now we have a vaping epidemic
 
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
going on in our state
 
02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:16.309 align:start position:0%
going on in our state
um

02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
for example in our 2019 uterus behavior
 
02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
survey we have around 34 percent of our
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
high school students reporting that they
 
02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
use uh vaping
 
02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
when compared to the new u.s average
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's only 13 percent so we have a big
 
02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
issue there
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
and in two years ago we have come to
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
this com this committee to talk about
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
increasing the age for the tobacco sales
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
by 21. so that's a big
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
thing that we have been talking about
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
so tobacco use not only have an impact
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
on the lung related illnesses especially
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
during this covet pandemic
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
but it also for youth it has um negative
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
health effects
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
they are also at risk of adverse brain
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
development because again with a
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
nicotine this has an addictive product
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
that has a direct impact on the
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
developing brains
 
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
so these are some of the issues and one
 
02:29:11.349 --> 02:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
example i just want to think about from
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
a numbers perspective
 
02:29:15.670 --> 02:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
tobacco or smoking causes smoking
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
related health care costs in new
 
02:29:20.270 --> 02:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire specifically is
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
729 million per year so just imagine
 
02:29:26.790 --> 02:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's the cost that we have to bear
 
02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:27.590 align:start position:0%
that's the cost that we have to bear
and

02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
when i'm looking at this one i have
 
02:29:31.270 --> 02:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
couple of questions for the committee to
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
think about if the goal is to eliminate
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
the liquor enforcement or the
 
02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:37.590 align:start position:0%
the liquor enforcement or the
enforcement

02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
group of this group
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
what's the plan for the replacement for
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
services provided by under this one one
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
is retail tobacco licensing
 
02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
retail restaurant licensing for alcohol
 
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
and liquor underage sales and monitoring
 
02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
for all products so alcohol tobacco
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
liquor and the most important is what's
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
the what is the plan for cynar
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'll go more detail about cyanar kind of
 
02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:02.550 align:start position:0%
i'll go more detail about cyanar kind of
thing

02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:30:04.630 --> 02:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
basically sign our amendment requires
 
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
like all states and territories whoever
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
get the substance um
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
abuse and mental health service
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
administration money they have to enact
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
and enforce laws prohibiting tobacco
 
02:30:17.429 --> 02:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
sales to minors
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
so basically
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
we in in new hampshire state received 13
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars as a block grant to
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
support our mental health and substance
 
02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.030 align:start position:0%
support our mental health and substance
use

02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
and we
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
proportion a small portion work with our
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
mou with the dle to do that services
 
02:30:33.840 --> 02:30:34.950 align:start position:0%
mou with the dle to do that services
and

02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
that actually would be impacted so if we
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
do not have a dle we would have to work
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
with our local enforcement local
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
our state enforcement and roughly we
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
have to pay almost close to uh 500 plus
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to do that work on it
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
on a on a regular basis
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
so if you're thinking about some of
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
these things the most important piece is
 
02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
this impact of this legislation is like
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of these services we would have to
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
depend on our state and local
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
departments to do that
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm more concerned about what kind
 
02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
of an enforcement we would be seeing and
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
how that would impact long-term issues
 
02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:11.429 align:start position:0%
how that would impact long-term issues
our

02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
underage health issues for our
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
really vulnerable population
 
02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
so those are some of our talking points
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
and um i'm open to taking questions and
 
02:31:25.270 --> 02:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
the community member we do have a
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
question representative abel
 
02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:33.990 align:start position:0%
question representative abel
yeah

02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay i've got it thank you uh thank you
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
so much for testifying uh let me be sure
 
02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
that i that i heard you correctly
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
you're estimating or projecting that
 
02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:46.389 align:start position:0%
you're estimating or projecting that
your

02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:31:49.349 --> 02:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
department would spend four hundred
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars more
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
under this uh scenario if if um thank
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
you for the question um representative
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
what we are estimating is we have an mou
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
with the dle to provide the services
 
02:32:05.750 --> 02:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
which is around 50 000
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
roughly which is a big investment from
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
our end but if we have to do with every
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
local city and think about that from
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
nashua manchester smaller towns so we
 
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
are estimating it to be close to 400 000
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
and this was 2020 estimates so
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
inflation so you're looking at close to
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thanks very much
 
02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thanks for coming and um
 
02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
and pointing out an important issue of
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
what um liquor commission also enforces
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
um i think we kind of sometimes lose
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
track of the fact that the tobacco
 
02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:48.309 align:start position:0%
track of the fact that the tobacco
related

02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
related
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
incidents are also part of their their
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement so um
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
i guess i have to make that a question
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
would you believe i appreciate your
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
being here thank you so much
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that that input
 
02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:02.630 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that that input
right

02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh so you know other questions thank you

very much for your testimony thank you
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%

and i just want you to know that i would
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
not forget it because i'm the one who
 
02:33:11.439 --> 02:33:13.190 align:start position:0%
not forget it because i'm the one who
actually

02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
ran the subcommittee the legislation
 
02:33:18.389 --> 02:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
to effectuate that the liquor commission
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
it was me
 
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
we'll go from smoking to liquor keep fry
 
02:33:37.270 --> 02:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
and i was going to say i care about both
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
and i'll be addressing both in my
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
so uh a lot of what i was going to bring
 
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
up was already brought up so i won't
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
repeat it and i do have written
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
testimony so i will just highlight a few
 
02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:03.270 align:start position:0%
testimony so i will just highlight a few
things

02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
again my name is kate friend the vice
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
president of advocacy at new futures
 
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're a nonpartisan nonprofit
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
organization that advocates educates and
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
collaborates to work on health and
 
02:34:15.990 --> 02:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
wellness issues we work extensively with
 
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
policy makers state agencies prevention
 
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
partners to reduce alcohol and other
 
02:34:22.710 --> 02:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
drug problems in our state
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
we oppose 1591 which would eliminate the
 
02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement authority of the new
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire liquor commission
 
02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
as you know the the division has many
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but they include the
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the state's alcoholic
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
beverage laws and administrative code of
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
rule and providing education awareness
 
02:34:42.950 --> 02:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
and outreach programming for licensing
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
um other law enforcement and public
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
groups and i just want to say that the
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
division is really part of new
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire's larger public health
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure when it comes to
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
preventing young people from alcohol and
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
tobacco use
 
02:34:57.830 --> 02:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
you hopefully will have a sign-in sheet
 
02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
from the online blue sheet of prevention
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
organizations youth advocacy groups that
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
find the division of liquor enforcement
 
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
a really important partner in their work
 
02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
working with young people and working on
 
02:35:14.550 --> 02:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
preventing substance misuse in their in
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
their communities
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
um simply put if uh this bill were to go
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
into effect it would jeopardize the safe
 
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
operation of licensed vaping and alcohol
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
establishments and the division's
 
02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
ability to protect vulnerable age
 
02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:31.110 align:start position:0%
ability to protect vulnerable age
youth

02:35:31.110 --> 02:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
youth
 
02:35:33.270 --> 02:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
dr sharala already spoke to the sinar
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
issue which would we would be very
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about the loss of
 
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
that funding would greatly impact
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment and recovery uh
 
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
funds to this state
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
so uh we don't take that lightly at all
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
um and i also just want to point out you
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
know tragically late last year we saw
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
firsthand what happens when liquor
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
establishes establishments decide to not
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
follow the law
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
the happy crab restaurant in salem new
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire served two teenagers
 
02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
17 drinks while the bartender also
 
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
participated drinking along with them
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
and later that evening one of the
 
02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
teenagers got behind the wheel and
 
02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
crashed the vehicle almost killing
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
himself and all three passengers
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission moved quickly to
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
suspend the restaurant's license and
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
ongoing investigation
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of alcohol beverage
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
control laws is an important component
 
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
of a comprehensive program designed to
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
protect the public health and safety
 
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
fortunately we don't hear about these
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
type of um tragic accidents every day
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
but if you were to eliminate an
 
02:36:38.469 --> 02:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency whose job is to
 
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
enforce those laws it would set the
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
state back and i'm
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
very sure that it would result in
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
devastating results
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
and then i just wanted to add a few
 
02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
things while i completely respect the
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors who brought this bill forward i
 
02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:54.550 align:start position:0%
sponsors who brought this bill forward i
also

02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
all right we were also concerned about
 
02:36:59.270 --> 02:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
the audit we have several concerns we do
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
we have been in touch with the liquor
 
02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:02.469 align:start position:0%
we have been in touch with the liquor
commission

02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
division enforcement on that um i think
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
our avenue is that we don't always feel
 
02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
that the liquor commission division
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement goes far enough so we have
 
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
our own concerns but i would
 
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree that we have been
 
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
able to have really frank conversations
 
02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with the liquor
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
commission division enforcement um when
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
we have issues and then we hear about
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
them in the field we bring them to
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
mark's attention and right away we get
 
02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
an answer of what may or may not have
 
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
happened and i think a perfect example
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
of how we work collaboratively was
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
tobacco 21 a few years ago where um the
 
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
state law was at 19 the federal law was
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
at 21 there was um
 
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
a struggle in enforcement because of
 
02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
the the state law still being 19 and you
 
02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
know we really worked through policy
 
02:37:52.710 --> 02:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
issues with
 
02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
that division and other tobacco-free new
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire partners and i think we ended
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
up with a great result so that is my
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and i will leave my written
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have any questions
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
i guess we're all set thank you okay
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
and you got one more card left nancy

association in new hampshire um and i'm
 
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
coming before you in opposition to this
 
02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:36.309 align:start position:0%
coming before you in opposition to this
bill

02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
i do have written testimony which i will
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
turn in um but i just wanted to um first
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
of all let people know because i really
 
02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
haven't been in front of this group
 
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
talking on tobacco issues for a while
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
but the american heart association has
 
02:38:52.309 --> 02:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
been involved for many decades on
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
tobacco control it is the
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco use is the number one
 
02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.270 align:start position:0%
tobacco use is the number one
preventable

02:38:57.270 --> 02:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
preventable
 
02:38:59.750 --> 02:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
cause of death from heart disease and
 
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
stroke and
 
02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
a preventable cause of heart disease
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
risk factors in in general
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
so this is a very important
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
part of
 
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
what the liquor commission does here in
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is is as
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
others before me
 
02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned is the tobacco control issue
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
which they have responsibility for
 
02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
working with tobacco retailers first of
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
all on educating them on the law
 
02:39:29.429 --> 02:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
and that's really the predominant role
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
that they do play
 
02:39:33.990 --> 02:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
if there are retailers who continue to
 
02:39:36.309 --> 02:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
fall out of compliance with the federal
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
and state law on tobacco 21
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
then they have other resources
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
that they can implement to ensure they
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
eventually do go into compliance
 
02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:48.790 align:start position:0%
eventually do go into compliance
without

02:39:48.790 --> 02:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement being able to
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
carry this out we also have concerns
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
that this would fall on local law
 
02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement authorities and for the same
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
reasons others have given this is not an
 
02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
ideal situation for dealing with
 
02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
underage tobacco use again we want the
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to remain
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
predominantly on the retailers complying
 
02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
with the law and not selling to
 
02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:15.429 align:start position:0%
with the law and not selling to
underaged

02:40:15.429 --> 02:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
underaged
 
02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:16.710 align:start position:0%
underaged
buyers

02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
buyers
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
but if
 
02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
if this is
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
carried out mainly at the local level we
 
02:40:23.349 --> 02:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
do have concerns
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
that youth will be the target of these
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues and this is a group
 
02:40:30.790 --> 02:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
that is purposefully being marketed to
 
02:40:32.710 --> 02:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
with these tobacco products kids are
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
getting hooked on nicotine in both
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
traditional cigarette product tobacco
 
02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
products as well as electronic
 
02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
cigarettes so we do not want to see them
 
02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
further punished with
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
monetary fees and fines that could come
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
down on them from the local level if
 
02:40:50.469 --> 02:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
caught with these products we really
 
02:40:52.469 --> 02:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
again it's the retailers that we want to
 
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
see worked with um on complying with the
 
02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:57.590 align:start position:0%
see worked with um on complying with the
law

02:40:57.590 --> 02:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
so again i do have written testimony but
 
02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions at this point
 
02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
on our involvement so if i understand
 
02:41:05.830 --> 02:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony correctly that if we were
 
02:41:07.510 --> 02:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
to pass this legislation we would
 
02:41:10.389 --> 02:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
probably have to revisit the tobacco
 
02:41:10.399 --> 02:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
probably have to revisit the tobacco
statutes

02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
and figure out who's now going to
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
enforce all these things
 
02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for bringing
 
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
that um that up representative hunt
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
126k is the youth access law it is not
 
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the the language of this
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
bill at all um but it it has many
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
provisions within 126k that address
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
youth tobacco use
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
and again it is the liquor commission
 
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
division enforcement that that carries
 
02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
those out we
 
02:41:41.269 --> 02:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
as an organization would like actually
 
02:41:44.150 --> 02:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
to see work done on 126k to remove the
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
penalties for youth
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
if caught with tobacco products
 
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that is a
 
02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:52.469 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that is a
a

02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
possibility with this bill
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
but it is something that we would like
 
02:41:57.429 --> 02:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
to see
 
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
but we do want to protect 126k because
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
it is the only enforcement that we have
 
02:42:05.429 --> 02:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
to protect youth from tobacco products
 
02:42:06.710 --> 02:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you very much
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%

02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%

04:17:44.710 --> 04:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chairman members of
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is rebecca
 
04:17:50.469 --> 04:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
mcwilliams i'm a representative for the
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
west side of concord so you are
 
04:17:57.189 --> 04:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.110 --> 04:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce bill 1523
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
and this is not set in stone this is
 
04:18:04.950 --> 04:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
really what i consider to be a draft to
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
start a conversation with the members of
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
the committee about solving a problem
 
04:18:08.479 --> 04:18:09.269 align:start position:0%
the committee about solving a problem
that

04:18:09.269 --> 04:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
i believe has been a long time coming
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
and is certainly ongoing
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
so just by way of background
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
i am a mom of three kids under the age
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
of five
 
04:18:20.149 --> 04:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
i have four-year-old twins who are
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
currently in a daycare actually right
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
now they're in daycare um and i have a
 
04:18:26.149 --> 04:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
one-year-old who is staying at home with
 
04:18:27.510 --> 04:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
my husband
 
04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
um and if we could find adequate care
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
for her he would be able to go back to
 
04:18:33.990 --> 04:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
the workforce but like so many stories
 
04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you have heard across the state
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire we have a lot of
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
caregivers for younger kids who have
 
04:18:43.110 --> 04:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
been sidelined due to covid and lack of
 
04:18:45.110 --> 04:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
quality daycare facilities
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
who are not able to participate in the
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
workforce because they have to stay home
 
04:18:50.070 --> 04:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
and take care of children
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
this also happens to grandparents of
 
04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
course we've just got people across the
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
state who are out of the workforce
 
04:18:56.229 --> 04:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
caring for kids
 
04:18:57.990 --> 04:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's a it's a nut that needs to
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
be cracked it's an ongoing problem we
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
had this issue pre-covered but i think
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
covid we could all agree has exacerbated
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
this significantly
 
04:19:08.070 --> 04:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
we've had quite a few daycares that have
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
closed because of covid and don't look
 
04:19:11.590 --> 04:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
like they're coming back online anytime
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
soon but
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of help and support i
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
think there's opportunity for us to
 
04:19:20.070 --> 04:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
solve this problem and hence the bill
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
the goal here is to create
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
a revolving new hampshire child care
 
04:19:24.479 --> 04:19:25.590 align:start position:0%
a revolving new hampshire child care
fund

04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:19:27.590 --> 04:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
so speaking in really broad terms what
 
04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it creates a fund
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's meant to be revolving and
 
04:19:33.510 --> 04:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
collecting interest and getting money
 
04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
back year after year so it's not just a
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
one-time thing
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
approximately half of the fund would be
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated to supporting
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
facility needs so if you would like to
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
open up a new daycare and you need to
 
04:19:48.149 --> 04:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
renovate a building and you'd like to
 
04:19:50.149 --> 04:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
take out a loan to do those renovation
 
04:19:53.110 --> 04:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
project tasks this fund could help you
 
04:19:54.630 --> 04:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
with a loan
 
04:19:57.510 --> 04:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
if you're looking to
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
buy or purchase a new facility same
 
04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
thing it's a potential supplementary
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
source of income for not income
 
04:20:03.840 --> 04:20:05.030 align:start position:0%
source of income for not income
supplement

04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
supplement
 
04:20:08.309 --> 04:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
supplementary source of funds for you to
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
start up a child care facility and often
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
i've heard this in other committees and
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
in other discussions about child care in
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature often what i hear from
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
people across the state is that the bar
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
to starting a child care is significant
 
04:20:25.110 --> 04:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
because you need to come up with your
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
own funds in order to open
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes that's too much for one
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
person or even a small business to take
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
on and so instead they decide to go into
 
04:20:37.110 --> 04:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
a different field
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
i think that that's kind of been
 
04:20:41.349 --> 04:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
pervasive over the years that people who
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
are qualified otherwise choose another
 
04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
field because they can't get access to
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
capital so this fund would solve the
 
04:20:49.269 --> 04:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
access to capital issue in the form of
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
loans and collecting some interest on
 
04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
those loans would allow the funds to
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
regenerate and continue going
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
the second half of the fund
 
04:21:01.269 --> 04:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
is intended to help the situation i
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
described earlier we have caregivers who
 
04:21:05.910 --> 04:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
have been sidelined and are unable to
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
participate in the workforce because
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
right now they are caring for children
 
04:21:12.149 --> 04:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
who are not yet old enough to go to
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
public school
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
these otherwise completely eligible to
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
work adults have been taken out of the
 
04:21:21.189 --> 04:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
workforce and if they could have help
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
either finding supplementary tuition or
 
04:21:25.510 --> 04:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
overall tuition
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
or of course we're talking about
 
04:21:28.630 --> 04:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
creating new child care facilities with
 
04:21:30.630 --> 04:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
the second half of the fund then we
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
would be regenerating replenishing the
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
industry of child care in new hampshire
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
with which right now is in dire straits
 
04:21:38.960 --> 04:21:39.670 align:start position:0%
with which right now is in dire straits
so

04:21:39.670 --> 04:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:42.389 --> 04:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the overall background as
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
to what we're talking about with this
 
04:21:46.469 --> 04:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
revolving child care fund bill
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
obviously i've made some assumptions in
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
the draft and i certainly would be happy
 
04:21:50.479 --> 04:21:51.429 align:start position:0%
the draft and i certainly would be happy
to

04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
participate in a working group to talk
 
04:21:55.990 --> 04:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
about some changes to this
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
right now i have this fund flowing
 
04:21:59.349 --> 04:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
through the department of health and
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
human services
 
04:22:03.030 --> 04:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
which as i understand has not
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
administered this kind of fund before so
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
there would need to be some expertise
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
key hires
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
accounting bookkeeping and even
 
04:22:13.590 --> 04:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
following new hampshire banking law so
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
those are new roles that would have to
 
04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
be created in dhhs in order to
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
administer the fund if it were
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
determined that the fund should live
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
under dhhs which is an assumption right
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
now in the draft of the bill
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
really i think the goal here is to set
 
04:22:32.550 --> 04:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
up a bucket right so we want to have a
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
place for funds to go
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
and obviously i mean i'll say it out
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
loud obviously this is preemptive
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
expecting that we will be receiving some
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
04:22:43.990 --> 04:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
at which time the buildback better act
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
passes specifically dedicated to child
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
care so the anticipation is the funds
 
04:22:51.269 --> 04:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
are coming let's set up a bucket to
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
receive those funds and i know this is a
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
little bit complicated because i don't
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
want to actually hire accountant
 
04:22:57.520 --> 04:22:59.189 align:start position:0%
want to actually hire accountant
bookkeeper

04:22:59.189 --> 04:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
bookkeeper
 
04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
minded folks to manage the fund if the
 
04:23:03.030 --> 04:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
fund has not been funded that would be a
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
waste of taxpayer dollars or in this
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
case that would be a waste of any
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
dollars that came into the fund before
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
it was ready to actually be used
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
but at such time that the fund is funded
 
04:23:15.510 --> 04:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
that would be when i'd want to pull the
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
trigger and actually hire the experts to
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
manage the fund so it's a little bit of
 
04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
a chicken and egg problem but i don't
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
want to waste money about it
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
so i think we probably would need to do
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
some tweaks on how the timing works
 
04:23:28.389 --> 04:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
let's just say build back better act
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
sends us 200 million dollars to new
 
04:23:30.159 --> 04:23:31.110 align:start position:0%
sends us 200 million dollars to new
hampshire

04:23:31.110 --> 04:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:23:33.429 --> 04:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
for child care we have the fund ready to
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
go within 90 days of receipt of federal
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
funding then we hire experts to address
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
that so it's something that this bill is
 
04:23:42.630 --> 04:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
silent on but i think it could be worked
 
04:23:42.640 --> 04:23:44.389 align:start position:0%
silent on but i think it could be worked
out

04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
just want to note note that there is a
 
04:23:50.309 --> 04:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on here from the department
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
obviously they have some concerns about
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
personnel and cost and it's
 
04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
indeterminate as to what the cost would
 
04:24:02.550 --> 04:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
be and i think that's fair because
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the portfolio
 
04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know if we're talking about several
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars that probably is
 
04:24:10.389 --> 04:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
two to four positions
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
but if the dollar value is less than
 
04:24:13.830 --> 04:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
that it may only be one position it
 
04:24:15.429 --> 04:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
really depends on what we're managing
 
04:24:17.590 --> 04:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
here so it's indeterminate because we
 
04:24:19.590 --> 04:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't even know the scope
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
but just anecdotally i will tell you
 
04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
that as the legislature we have an
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to step up and create this
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
bucket to receive funds and if we don't
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
do this if the funds show up and go into
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
our general fund then we lose out on the
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to really target them to
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
solve the underlying problem which is we
 
04:24:42.149 --> 04:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
have a real real issue with the child
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
care business in new hampshire losing
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
facilities not being able to start a
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
facility and parents who otherwise could
 
04:24:49.990 --> 04:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
work but are stuck home with their kids
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
because they can't find quality child
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
care so with that i'm happy to take
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
questions on the bill
 
04:24:56.239 --> 04:24:57.189 align:start position:0%
questions on the bill
okay

04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:58.710 --> 04:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
do you see some questions representative
 
04:24:58.720 --> 04:25:00.389 align:start position:0%
do you see some questions representative
bartlett

04:25:00.389 --> 04:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
bartlett
 
04:25:02.309 --> 04:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair and thanks for
 
04:25:04.229 --> 04:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
coming to see us with this great idea
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative williams full disclosure
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
i'm president of the board of the
 
04:25:10.229 --> 04:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
merrimack valley daycare center
 
04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
we struggle with this issue year after
 
04:25:14.149 --> 04:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
04:25:15.910 --> 04:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
um what this
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of things would you be willing
 
04:25:18.080 --> 04:25:20.070 align:start position:0%
a couple of things would you be willing
to

04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
consider an amendment to make this a
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
study committee because you're right
 
04:25:25.349 --> 04:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
this is a very complicated issue
 
04:25:27.030 --> 04:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
um and there are
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of considerations to be addressed
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
but the other part of that's not in here
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if you're considering
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is staffing is huge
 
04:25:37.590 --> 04:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
many daycare centers struggle with
 
04:25:42.070 --> 04:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
week to week not even just month to
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
month because they can many child care
 
04:25:46.790 --> 04:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
workers can make more money at dunkin
 
04:25:49.510 --> 04:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
donuts or walmart than they can taking
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
care of our children
 
04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
um because this is not a priority for
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
our society
 
04:25:56.710 --> 04:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
um would you be willing to amend this so
 
04:25:58.950 --> 04:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
that we could look at this in a whole
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the other part of this is that the
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
child care
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
education programs have been
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated in the budget over the last
 
04:26:13.269 --> 04:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
five years for our university system
 
04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
three-part question okay we've got study
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
committee staffing and the pipeline all
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
right let's start with study committee
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
obviously i would like to get the whole
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
apple but if this needs to become a
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
study committee i'm willing to work with
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
this committee and do a study committee
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
this fall i would be open to that my
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
preference would be to try to resolve
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
some of these things a little bit
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
earlier through a working committee if
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
in in terms
 
04:26:47.830 --> 04:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
of paying workers as part of the fund
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think that when i say that tuition is
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
the second half of the fund
 
04:26:56.790 --> 04:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
tuition includes wages for staff at a
 
04:26:58.790 --> 04:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
daycare facility
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that it needs to be
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
broken out further as wages versus just
 
04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
saying it's meant to be tuition
 
04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
assistance for
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
children whose caregivers otherwise
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
would be working
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a little squishy but we
 
04:27:17.670 --> 04:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
could talk about it in a work session um
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
i think that when you start to get into
 
04:27:21.110 --> 04:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
the weeds about what a fund can and
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
cannot be spent on there's winners and
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
losers and i think tuition kind of keeps
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
it more of a general
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
i would say that in
 
04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
in a broad stroke
 
04:27:33.110 --> 04:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
tuition for child care in new hampshire
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
has actually gone up pretty
 
04:27:37.590 --> 04:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
significantly in the last two years
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm just speaking from personal
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
experience since my four-year-olds have
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
been in a child care facility for the
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
last three years
 
04:27:48.149 --> 04:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
the the dollar value has gone up um
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
almost 500 a month so that that's a lot
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
for for a family that may have one
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
working parent and one not working
 
04:27:57.670 --> 04:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
parent it's just it's a lot
 
04:27:57.680 --> 04:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
parent it's just it's a lot
um

04:27:58.710 --> 04:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
so so i think i'm open to a conversation
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
about applying tuition dollars or how
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
the tuition is determined
 
04:28:09.110 --> 04:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
um but i you know i i think that wages
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
is certainly one of the issues that
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
we've looked at in child care we've
 
04:28:14.309 --> 04:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
tried to crunch this many different ways
 
04:28:15.990 --> 04:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right to say that you
 
04:28:17.590 --> 04:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
can make more money working at dunkin
 
04:28:19.510 --> 04:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
donuts at the window than you can
 
04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
working at a child care facility and
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
honestly that is really sad for the
 
04:28:25.590 --> 04:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
future of child care because we have
 
04:28:27.990 --> 04:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
graduates workforce coming out of high
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
school who may be really interested in
 
04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
working with kids but they know they can
 
04:28:34.710 --> 04:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
make more money at a retail job and it
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
may not just be dunkin donuts it could
 
04:28:38.469 --> 04:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
be anything in retail
 
04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
and not saying that we don't need people
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
working retail jobs in new hampshire but
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
when someone is sidelined immediately
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
after graduation they have a passion for
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
kids they may have already been a
 
04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
babysitter and gotten cpr certified you
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
know they're halfway there
 
04:28:53.590 --> 04:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
and then they decide well this isn't the
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
future for me because there's no money
 
04:28:57.110 --> 04:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
in it then we just end up with this
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing cycle of we can't find people to
 
04:29:02.070 --> 04:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
work at care facilities because they've
 
04:29:03.429 --> 04:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
already decided that it's not the
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
business for them to be in for a
 
04:29:06.550 --> 04:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
long-term career
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
so certainly pipeline is a concern i
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
know we had some programs probably 10 or
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
12 years ago as part of high school
 
04:29:16.309 --> 04:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
to allow students to get their
 
04:29:18.870 --> 04:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
certificate at a technical college in
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
order to immediately become a daycare
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
worker and manage a class full-time my
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is that those programs got
 
04:29:25.600 --> 04:29:26.870 align:start position:0%
understanding is that those programs got
unfunded

04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
that you can't do that anymore so you
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
would have to go out on your own and
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
spend your own dollars to get your
 
04:29:35.030 --> 04:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
certificate either online or taking some
 
04:29:35.040 --> 04:29:36.149 align:start position:0%
certificate either online or taking some
classes

04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
classes
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
in person
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
that i think that creates a barrier to
 
04:29:39.040 --> 04:29:40.389 align:start position:0%
that i think that creates a barrier to
entry

04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
entry
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
certainly if we're able to do this with
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
other apprenticeship and trade programs
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
for construction i don't know why we
 
04:29:47.429 --> 04:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to do this for child
 
04:29:49.269 --> 04:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
care because
 
04:29:51.269 --> 04:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
there's a huge need in new hampshire and
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:57.429 --> 04:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
representative weston
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh representative williams
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
for bringing this to us
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
i am
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
i like the idea of having something some
 
04:30:09.030 --> 04:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
structure already in place in case this
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
money does come through we don't want to
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
wait too long and
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
not use not have the
 
04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
facility set up
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
i am curious why you've chosen dhhs to
 
04:30:21.429 --> 04:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
manage this
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
and my understanding was that in the
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
past there was a child care fund managed
 
04:30:28.229 --> 04:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
through the new hampshire community loan
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
fund and i'm wondering why you wouldn't
 
04:30:33.189 --> 04:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
use that same structure
 
04:30:35.189 --> 04:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
great question
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
so the new hampshire community loan fund
 
04:30:39.910 --> 04:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
did administer some funds for child care
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
tuition through the late 1990s
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then they ran out of money so it
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
basically just dissolved and went into
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
the community loan funds general fund
 
04:30:52.229 --> 04:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
so there to my understanding there is
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
not a focus right now at the new
 
04:30:55.590 --> 04:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire community loan fund related to
 
04:30:57.110 --> 04:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
child care
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
and tuition for child care
 
04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
i think that it's great to have a
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
non-profit that can be focused on
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe that all of the
 
04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
funds that we're expecting to receive
 
04:31:10.389 --> 04:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
from the fed would need to go to a
 
04:31:12.550 --> 04:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
non-profit to be administered
 
04:31:13.750 --> 04:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
because they would have to go through
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
the request for proposal process right
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
so they would be submitting a proposal
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
competing with other non-profits to
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
administer a fund and then if they are
 
04:31:24.630 --> 04:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
awarded or multiple non-profits are
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
awarded this
 
04:31:26.159 --> 04:31:27.429 align:start position:0%
awarded this
rfp

04:31:27.429 --> 04:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
rfp
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
then they would receive a slice of the
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
pizza say a sixteenth of the slice of
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
the pizza
 
04:31:35.429 --> 04:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
and i really want the whole pizza to be
 
04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
administered in one place so
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
while a non-profit managing small
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
dollars may make sense
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
i think it it's
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
wiser over the course of how this will
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
play out
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
to keep an extra administrative hurdle
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
out of it and also for the dollars we're
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
talking about to make sure that it's
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
managed in one place
 
04:31:56.550 --> 04:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:04.389 --> 04:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
this has to go to some sort of study
 
04:32:09.830 --> 04:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee i mean
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
i can think of a
 
04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that need to be firm
 
04:32:19.349 --> 04:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh before it becomes legislation and uh
 
04:32:19.359 --> 04:32:20.710 align:start position:0%
uh before it becomes legislation and uh
um

04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh i mean if if the if if you could make
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
a profit
 
04:32:26.720 --> 04:32:27.670 align:start position:0%
a profit
uh

04:32:27.670 --> 04:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
on taking care of these kids
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
believe me
 
04:32:32.790 --> 04:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't be happening we wouldn't
 
04:32:34.469 --> 04:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
be having this conversation
 
04:32:36.790 --> 04:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
so obviously that's not the case
 
04:32:39.590 --> 04:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
which means that the federal government
 
04:32:42.309 --> 04:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
is going to have to get involved
 
04:32:44.309 --> 04:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
how you exactly do that needs to be
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
figured out
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
and how you
 
04:32:49.110 --> 04:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know and you've gone through uh some
 
04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
scenarios which makes sense to me
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
but it just needs to be hammered out i
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
mean there are just
 
04:32:59.030 --> 04:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's going to be a government
 
04:32:59.040 --> 04:33:00.389 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's going to be a government
program

04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
period be otherwise it's not going to
 
04:33:04.150 --> 04:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
happen so uh
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
the private sector cannot and will not
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
invest enough money so
 
04:33:11.349 --> 04:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
any kindergarten that would survive is
 
04:33:14.830 --> 04:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
there a question
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
here uh
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
so i think that in order to get uh
 
04:33:19.840 --> 04:33:21.109 align:start position:0%
so i think that in order to get uh
support

04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
it would be my recommendation i think
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
that you it's not a question that's an
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
opinion if you go to a study committee
 
04:33:30.080 --> 04:33:31.269 align:start position:0%
opinion if you go to a study committee
scenario

04:33:31.269 --> 04:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
04:33:33.429 --> 04:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
you might get somewhere which is what i
 
04:33:37.269 --> 04:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
don't know how to ask the question would
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
you believe he thinks he needs to study
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe what do you think we
 
04:33:43.910 --> 04:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
need to go to study on this yeah i
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
believe you need to go to a study
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
committee would you believe to that we
 
04:33:51.429 --> 04:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is why i don't make a lot of
 
04:33:56.400 --> 04:33:58.230 align:start position:0%
this is why i don't make a lot of
speeches

04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
speeches
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you very
 
04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if you had a chance
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
to run this by the
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire council for child advocacy
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
i have not no
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
i think that they could be
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
i think you'd find that they'd be very
 
04:34:14.879 --> 04:34:16.551 align:start position:0%
i think you'd find that they'd be very
helpful

04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.470 --> 04:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative perez thank you
 
04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
do you believe that
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill we can utilize
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
some of the uh other industries that are
 
04:34:33.269 --> 04:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
already using um
 
04:34:33.279 --> 04:34:34.709 align:start position:0%
already using um
colleges

04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
and trade schools like bai system for
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
example you know they have some programs
 
04:34:42.629 --> 04:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
that they train people
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
and they already have a job lined up
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
after they finish the 15 weeks of
 
04:34:50.551 --> 04:34:50.561 align:start position:0%
training do you believe that this bill
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
ideas from other programs and we can
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
have more people train and quickly make
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
our time and then have day cares or
 
04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
providers they can have jobs lined up
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
for the people who's getting this type
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
of training
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think providing training is always a
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think the challenge that we are
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
running into right now in new hampshire
 
04:35:19.269 --> 04:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
is wages
 
04:35:21.510 --> 04:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
and perhaps there could be a bonus
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
related to completing training in order
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
to incentivize
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
but to get people to attend that
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
training they have to be able to see the
 
04:35:33.990 --> 04:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
cherry or the apple or whatever they're
 
04:35:34.000 --> 04:35:35.429 align:start position:0%
cherry or the apple or whatever they're
chasing

04:35:35.429 --> 04:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
chasing
 
04:35:38.949 --> 04:35:38.959 align:start position:0%
and so right now i think it's become
 
04:35:42.230 --> 04:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
a less wanted industry
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
by people who are entering the workforce
 
04:35:49.990 --> 04:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
because they don't see that cherry
 
04:35:51.590 --> 04:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
at the end if they were to go through
 
04:35:53.349 --> 04:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
the training is it really going to be
 
04:35:55.990 --> 04:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
worth it for me and my family when i
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%
start making money and so
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
training is great i think
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
creating an easy way to get training
 
04:36:04.150 --> 04:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
especially as part of a high school
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
curriculum is awesome but there also
 
04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:08.561 align:start position:0%
needs to be something a little bit more
 
04:36:09.990 --> 04:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
in order to make it something people are
 
04:36:14.949 --> 04:36:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:17.029 --> 04:36:17.039 align:start position:0%
representative mcaleer
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for uh for coming today
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
just a question here you're talking
 
04:36:21.359 --> 04:36:22.070 align:start position:0%
just a question here you're talking
about

04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh providing financing and investment
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
services do you do you see
 
04:36:29.189 --> 04:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
that the folks controlling this um
 
04:36:29.199 --> 04:36:30.310 align:start position:0%
that the folks controlling this um
basically

04:36:30.310 --> 04:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
hire outside fund uh advisors investors
 
04:36:36.310 --> 04:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
investment firms
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
are you doing it yourself
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know i think it really depends on
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
the value of the fund right
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
it depends on the value of the fund
 
04:36:45.429 --> 04:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
right if we're talking about hundreds of
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars it may make sense to
 
04:36:49.510 --> 04:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
bring in outside investors so that some
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
of that fun that's set aside can collect
 
04:36:51.840 --> 04:36:53.029 align:start position:0%
of that fun that's set aside can collect
interest

04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
in good investments
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
but if the size of the fund was only say
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
you know 10 to 25 million
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be bringing in outside
 
04:37:03.189 --> 04:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
investors for something somewhat smaller
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
right thank you sure
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
representative for presenting the bill
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
answering our questions
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
you mentioned earlier that it costs too
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
much to open a business and yet there's
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
this tremendous demand a need for child
 
04:37:23.269 --> 04:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.830 --> 04:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
so what are the obstacles to these
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
businesses private businesses being able
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
to open have you looked at regulations
 
04:37:32.230 --> 04:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
statutes current statutes now that might
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
be hindering
 
04:37:37.029 --> 04:37:37.039 align:start position:0%
a private business from opening and why
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
is it the state's responsibility to take
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
care of your child's care needs okay
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
let's start with the hindrances to to
 
04:37:44.320 --> 04:37:46.949 align:start position:0%
let's start with the hindrances to to
business

04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
generally what we're looking at is
 
04:37:50.070 --> 04:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
someone who wants to start a daycare and
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
they want to open up a facility so they
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
need to either buy a buy a building or
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
lease a space usually they're going to
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
lease a space as a step in the right
 
04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
direction so they're going to need to
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
get a business loan
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
often and this is true across any
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire often the
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
issues with getting a business loan are
 
04:38:08.709 --> 04:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
debt to income right when we're looking
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
at somebody who wants to start a daycare
 
04:38:12.150 --> 04:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
facility they may already have
 
04:38:14.551 --> 04:38:14.561 align:start position:0%
significant credit card debt and so the
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
bank will say i'm really sorry but you
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
just have too much debt we can't take a
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
chance on you with a business loan
 
04:38:21.429 --> 04:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
one of the other things we run into is
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
someone who has already failed doing
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
some other business and so the bank will
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
say well it looks like you defaulted on
 
04:38:28.949 --> 04:38:28.959 align:start position:0%
a previous loan and so we're not willing
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
to give this to you again
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
folks who this is broad swath and not
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
meant to mean everyone but as a as a
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
general folks folks who want to start a
 
04:38:42.390 --> 04:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
daycare facility in new hampshire are
 
04:38:44.390 --> 04:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
not in it for the money and they tend
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
not to have the money behind the
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
business startup in order to show oh hey
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
i own my house so you could use my you
 
04:38:53.910 --> 04:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
could use my home as collateral for this
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
loan we're talking about someone who may
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
already be renting and doesn't have a
 
04:38:59.830 --> 04:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
lot of cash saved up to say that they're
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
putting in a certain percentage to start
 
04:39:03.750 --> 04:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
the business so they don't look like a
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
good bet to a typical private bank
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean they don't love
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
children and wouldn't be good at it it
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
just means that when you look at them on
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
paper they're not a good bet for a
 
04:39:15.830 --> 04:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
private bank and that's typically when
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're asking the state or in this case
 
04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
the fed through the state to step in and
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
to support something that we need as a
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
service for the state
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
because we're seeing an awful lot of
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
caregivers who can't work right now due
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
to lack of daycare facilities that
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
sideline the economy
 
04:39:34.150 --> 04:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
we have way more people hiring than we
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
have jobs right now as a general rule in
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i hope that we can
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
come up with some solutions to shake out
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
more of those employees to work i think
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
providing opportunity for daycare
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
businesses to start would then provide
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
more care providers and free up some of
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
these people to work in the jobs
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
so your second question was why is it
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
the state's responsibility to provide
 
04:39:56.708 --> 04:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
care for kids
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
and i would say in general it's the
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
state's responsibility to provide an
 
04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
education for all of the children in new
 
04:40:03.670 --> 04:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire we've already committed to do
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
that through our public schools and
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're extending that through vouchers
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
however people choose to learn so we've
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
committed as a state to provide funding
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
to children's education
 
04:40:14.550 --> 04:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're already there
 
04:40:15.990 --> 04:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about the children
 
04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
under the age of five who are not yet in
 
04:40:20.708 --> 04:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
kindergarten but we know as a state that
 
04:40:22.628 --> 04:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
this is causing us serious problems with
 
04:40:24.948 --> 04:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
our economy and our workforce and so we
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
decide yes also educating younger
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
children makes sense and we're willing
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
oh we do have representative
 
04:40:40.470 --> 04:40:40.480 align:start position:0%

04:40:44.310 --> 04:40:44.320 align:start position:0%

stability for the department
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i just want to start off on a couple
 
04:41:39.270 --> 04:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
of this high level point
 
04:41:41.110 --> 04:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
i would like to start off on a couple of
 
04:41:43.030 --> 04:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
high level points
 
04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i do want to thank the committee and
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
also the bill's sponsor representative
 
04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
mick williams and her willingness to
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
examine the issues and looking at other
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
approaches perhaps accomplishing her
 
04:41:55.110 --> 04:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
goal it's very clear that the department
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
of health and human services is not a
 
04:41:58.470 --> 04:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
financial institution we are not an
 
04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
investment institution and for us to
 
04:42:03.670 --> 04:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
comply with the request here with no
 
04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
state fund or general fund appropriation
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
to stand up the program
 
04:42:09.590 --> 04:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
we lack the expertise to do the kind of
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
thoughtful work that needs to be done
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
with a bill like this so i have to say
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative weston i did not know of
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire community loan fund
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
but perhaps that's something that could
 
04:42:21.430 --> 04:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
be looked at as a similar kind of
 
04:42:23.670 --> 04:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
approach to appropriately
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
managing these funds whether the
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
investment that the money might be
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
received by the department is one dollar
 
04:42:33.670 --> 04:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
or a billion dollars it still requires
 
04:42:35.830 --> 04:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
us to comply with all banking laws and
 
04:42:37.990 --> 04:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
regulations as any other financial
 
04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
institution or investment institution we
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
do a good job in the works that we do in
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
serving the citizens of new hampshire
 
04:42:47.590 --> 04:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
to making them healthier
 
04:42:49.590 --> 04:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
to have them grant independence but
 
04:42:51.510 --> 04:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're not an investment institution so
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
again i just wanted to thank the sponsor
 
04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
and her willingness to re-examine the
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
assumption of placing this
 
04:42:59.110 --> 04:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility on our agency i would
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
like to ask
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
our director
 
04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
ms hebert if she would provide
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
commentary to the committee
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
from her review of the legislation
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
so i also want to give representative
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
mick williams a great amount of credit
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
any efforts or ideas to improve the
 
04:43:20.310 --> 04:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
child care industry are always worth
 
04:43:20.320 --> 04:43:21.510 align:start position:0%
child care industry are always worth
examining

04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
examining
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm really appreciative that she's
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
able to bring that forward
 
04:43:29.430 --> 04:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
there is the potential of some
 
04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
duplicity in the bill
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
where it does seek to establish
 
04:43:35.670 --> 04:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
resources for child care providers
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
including startups so these resources do
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
exist in new hampshire as you may know
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
such as the community development
 
04:43:44.230 --> 04:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
finance authority and the community loan
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
fund which as i understand will offer
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
services including tax credits loans and
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:55.750 --> 04:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
there is also
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
maybe helpful to know the
 
04:44:00.628 --> 04:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
ongoing efforts that are being made by
 
04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
the department currently
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to federal funding that the
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
bureau of child development and head
 
04:44:09.590 --> 04:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
start collaboration has been
 
04:44:09.600 --> 04:44:10.868 align:start position:0%
start collaboration has been
distributing

04:44:10.868 --> 04:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
distributing
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's approximately over 142 million
 
04:44:15.670 --> 04:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
dollars in the last year as a result of
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
the various coveted funding streams that
 
04:44:19.270 --> 04:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
we've received and we're really making
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
efforts to distribute that funding to
 
04:44:25.270 --> 04:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
support the child care industry there's
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of work left to be done and i
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
think that while this is certainly an
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
idea we want to make sure that it is not
 
04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
duplicative of certain efforts that are
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
currently being made by the department
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
with some of this federal funding and
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
that includes stabilization dollars over
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
a 49
 
04:44:42.628 --> 04:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's been distributed
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
there are over 800 providers across the
 
04:44:45.120 --> 04:44:45.990 align:start position:0%
there are over 800 providers across the
state

04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:44:46.000 --> 04:44:47.750 align:start position:0%
state
um

04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
615 of them
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
have taken advantage of this funding
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
resource to help stabilize their
 
04:44:54.480 --> 04:44:55.670 align:start position:0%
resource to help stabilize their
programs

04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:44:58.150 --> 04:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't answer everything but indeed
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
it is hoping to make a particular dent
 
04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
in that process
 
04:45:02.400 --> 04:45:03.830 align:start position:0%
in that process
so

04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
there is also
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
an additional discretionary fund from
 
04:45:09.910 --> 04:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan dollars and the
 
04:45:11.830 --> 04:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
amount of 29 million dollars that we're
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
04:45:14.948 --> 04:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
uh and working with our stakeholders to
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
try to identify what are the priorities
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
that money would be useful for and we're
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
really narrowing that down to a number
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
of workforce initiatives
 
04:45:25.920 --> 04:45:27.110 align:start position:0%
of workforce initiatives
provider

04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
assistance and family support
 
04:45:32.708 --> 04:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
those initiatives are being
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
and currently there are initiatives
 
04:45:40.470 --> 04:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
going on
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
to expand or really pilot programs right
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
now to try to test the expansion
 
04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
for individuals who may be eligible for
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
the child care what's known as the child
 
04:45:52.948 --> 04:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
care scholarship program it's child care
 
04:45:52.958 --> 04:45:54.150 align:start position:0%
care scholarship program it's child care
assistance

04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
and what we want to be able to do is
 
04:45:58.948 --> 04:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
test the expansion of
 
04:46:01.430 --> 04:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
income eligibility for this it's paid
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
for through the child care development
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
fund which is a federal funding stream
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
and if we're able to
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
be successful in some of these pilot
 
04:46:09.120 --> 04:46:10.550 align:start position:0%
be successful in some of these pilot
programs

04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
bring that into the agency budget in the
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
future and hopefully be able to serve
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
many more parents than what are
 
04:46:20.708 --> 04:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
currently able to
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh to utilize in or to be eligible for
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
that particular funding
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of other ish
 
04:46:32.470 --> 04:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
initiatives that are ongoing as well
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
with respect to raising non-traditional
 
04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
raising uh rates uh state payment rates
 
04:46:39.990 --> 04:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
for providers providing non-traditional
 
04:46:40.000 --> 04:46:40.948 align:start position:0%
for providers providing non-traditional
hours

04:46:40.948 --> 04:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
hours
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
and continuing to provide employer
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
support for child care
 
04:46:46.470 --> 04:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
all in response to what's known as the
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
cliff effect so these are there's a lot
 
04:46:51.190 --> 04:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
in the industry that
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:46:53.910 --> 04:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
complex industry
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
and also complicated by a number of
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
influencing factors one of them for
 
04:47:00.788 --> 04:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
example is the cliff effect which is for
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
individuals who may be receiving public
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
assistance who
 
04:47:07.270 --> 04:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
by way of acquiring employment
 
04:47:09.270 --> 04:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
which increases their income
 
04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
leaves them no longer eligible for
 
04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
public assistance yet the difference is
 
04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
such that
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
they fall off the cliff essentially
 
04:47:19.670 --> 04:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
where the the income that they're now
 
04:47:19.680 --> 04:47:20.788 align:start position:0%
where the the income that they're now
making

04:47:20.788 --> 04:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
making
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
is not what they were making while they
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
were on public assistance benefits
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways we can incentivize
 
04:47:30.878 --> 04:47:33.750 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways we can incentivize
making

04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
making that easier for people so they
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
don't fall off that cliff so we can try
 
04:47:39.510 --> 04:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
to engage with people who are receiving
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
public assistance so that they can
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
questions you want to keep going so yes
 
04:47:53.830 --> 04:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
chairman i just wanted for clarification
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
on page three starting on lines nine
 
04:47:57.990 --> 04:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
through 10.
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
the bill does currently is drafted make
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
clear that the funds would be separate
 
04:48:04.470 --> 04:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
from the child care scholarship program
 
04:48:06.390 --> 04:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
i just out of fairness to the bill's
 
04:48:08.788 --> 04:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor that the commentary by director
 
04:48:10.628 --> 04:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
hebert was meant to elaborate on those
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
efforts we're making around the child
 
04:48:14.708 --> 04:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
care scholarship and i just wanted to as
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
a point of reference bring that to the
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee's attention that the bill was
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
representative hubert
 
04:48:32.958 --> 04:48:34.550 align:start position:0%
representative hubert
does

04:48:34.550 --> 04:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:48:37.510 --> 04:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
there's a federal program called the aid
 
04:48:37.520 --> 04:48:39.350 align:start position:0%
there's a federal program called the aid
to

04:48:39.350 --> 04:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
families i forget what it's called it
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
used to be called the um yeah a2
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
families with dependent children afdc
 
04:48:49.030 --> 04:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
which has been replaced by tanf
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
temporary assistance for needy families
 
04:48:52.948 --> 04:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
is that what you're referring to
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
yes is that an area that
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
a funding area that might be available
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
i could certainly look into that further
 
04:49:06.550 --> 04:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe so because of the
 
04:49:09.270 --> 04:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
regulations around federal funding
 
04:49:10.868 --> 04:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
that would be for this particular
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
purpose tanf funding has specific
 
04:49:13.520 --> 04:49:14.788 align:start position:0%
purpose tanf funding has specific
purposes

04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
that have to be met for the use of that
 
04:49:16.878 --> 04:49:17.910 align:start position:0%
that have to be met for the use of that
funding

04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:22.400 --> 04:49:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing any get off
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:37.510 --> 04:49:37.520 align:start position:0%

online there was 61 people for it and
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
four post
 
04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:54.480 align:start position:0%

04:54:28.718 --> 04:54:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
essentially

04:54:37.030 --> 04:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.040 --> 04:54:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
is

is

04:57:14.310 --> 04:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:24.320 --> 04:57:32.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm somewhat waiting for the sponsor
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
because he has another hearing
 
05:07:00.550 --> 05:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%

05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
the hotels we were staying at
 
05:08:31.110 --> 05:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
and every day you see they get out they
 
05:08:33.270 --> 05:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
get a pump they have this big water
 
05:08:33.280 --> 05:08:34.310 align:start position:0%
get a pump they have this big water
slide

05:08:34.310 --> 05:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
slide
 
05:08:38.310 --> 05:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's like a two-story water slide
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
life's tough for you you're really that
 
05:22:16.310 --> 05:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
waiting to speak at 1 45 and
 
05:22:20.470 --> 05:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
so i certainly apologize for my
 
05:22:20.480 --> 05:22:21.510 align:start position:0%
so i certainly apologize for my
tardiness

05:22:21.510 --> 05:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
tardiness
 
05:22:23.910 --> 05:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
no problem okay thank you and uh mr
 
05:22:25.430 --> 05:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
chairman through you
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
to my esteemed colleagues um of the
 
05:22:30.390 --> 05:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
general court my name is bill boyd
 
05:22:32.628 --> 05:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
and i represent
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
district 21 in hillsborough town of
 
05:22:37.350 --> 05:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
merrimack i come to you today before
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
before you
 
05:22:40.708 --> 05:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
to present house bill 1589 which
 
05:22:42.868 --> 05:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
prohibits a sale of products
 
05:22:47.110 --> 05:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
containing intentionally added pfas
 
05:22:49.590 --> 05:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
the language that you have before you on
 
05:22:52.628 --> 05:22:52.638 align:start position:0%
the bill is modeled after maine's law
 
05:22:54.390 --> 05:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
which was recently
 
05:22:57.270 --> 05:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
passed within the last year
 
05:22:59.350 --> 05:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
the key components to this bill are
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
two-fold it's phasing out rugged fabric
 
05:23:04.708 --> 05:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
treatments by 2024
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
and it includes another phase of other
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
phos laden products phased out by 2030.
 
05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
as i know many of you are
 
05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
05:23:16.708 --> 05:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
the issues and the challenges that my
 
05:23:19.270 --> 05:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
community of merrimack has experienced
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
regarding pfas
 
05:23:24.070 --> 05:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
i know that all of you are aware from
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
from reading stories in the paper about
 
05:23:29.190 --> 05:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
the long-term impacts that pfos have
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
on people especially the way that it
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
impacts bodies the way that it impacts
 
05:23:36.070 --> 05:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
fetal development but even more so
 
05:23:37.750 --> 05:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
how this chemical has impacted my
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
community of merrimack but the
 
05:23:40.548 --> 05:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
communities of londonderry
 
05:23:42.548 --> 05:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
litchfield amherst in the communities
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
that surround the pease air force base
 
05:23:47.190 --> 05:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
as a consequence forever chemicals have
 
05:23:47.200 --> 05:23:48.390 align:start position:0%
as a consequence forever chemicals have
become

05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
become
 
05:23:48.400 --> 05:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
become
a

05:23:49.430 --> 05:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:23:52.948 --> 05:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
permanent fixture in our life and
 
05:23:52.958 --> 05:23:54.470 align:start position:0%
permanent fixture in our life and
subsequently

05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
subsequently
 
05:23:57.270 --> 05:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
with pfas comes a long shelf life
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
that has far-reaching impacts as it
 
05:24:00.788 --> 05:24:00.798 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
not only our natural resources
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
but on our public health
 
05:24:07.030 --> 05:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
many of you
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
we're given commissioner scott's letter
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
um to the committee regarding
 
05:24:11.760 --> 05:24:12.470 align:start position:0%
um to the committee regarding
the

05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:24:14.230 --> 05:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
of of what it would cost to enact the
 
05:24:18.310 --> 05:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
law and begin the process
 
05:24:21.750 --> 05:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
of of how we would phase out
 
05:24:23.670 --> 05:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
these pfas products and i certainly want
 
05:24:23.680 --> 05:24:24.390 align:start position:0%
these pfas products and i certainly want
to

05:24:24.390 --> 05:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:24:25.830 --> 05:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
want to thank
 
05:24:28.548 --> 05:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
des for putting that together because
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
what i am proposing
 
05:24:32.150 --> 05:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
is significant
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
and while the timeline is ambitious it
 
05:24:35.520 --> 05:24:36.628 align:start position:0%
and while the timeline is ambitious it
certainly

05:24:36.628 --> 05:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:24:39.670 --> 05:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
is is an element of concern that he has
 
05:24:42.390 --> 05:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
and expressed in his letter out of of
 
05:24:44.070 --> 05:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
all the pfos bills that i've raised this
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
year can actually say this is a letter
 
05:24:47.830 --> 05:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
where i didn't see the word opposed he
 
05:24:50.150 --> 05:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
actually said concerned and i'm very
 
05:24:52.230 --> 05:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
grateful for the commissioner for
 
05:24:55.350 --> 05:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
amplifying that kind of language
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest to you
 
05:24:57.440 --> 05:24:58.470 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest to you
that

05:24:58.470 --> 05:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:58.480 --> 05:24:59.990 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:01.350 --> 05:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
the cost concerns are certainly
 
05:25:03.910 --> 05:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate i don't i don't dismiss that
 
05:25:06.070 --> 05:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
but if we're going to move forward
 
05:25:08.470 --> 05:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
on creating
 
05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
a program within des
 
05:25:11.200 --> 05:25:13.190 align:start position:0%
a program within des
that

05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
puts down the foundation and hires an
 
05:25:18.230 --> 05:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
individual to create the mechanics as to
 
05:25:20.548 --> 05:25:20.558 align:start position:0%
how we're going to evaluate
 
05:25:23.350 --> 05:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
and restrict these types of pfas
 
05:25:25.910 --> 05:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
products in new hampshire
 
05:25:27.190 --> 05:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be a there's
 
05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to be a level of funding
 
05:25:30.470 --> 05:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
and we're going to need an individual to
 
05:25:32.310 --> 05:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
provide a level of of data collection
 
05:25:33.990 --> 05:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
that would be necessary
 
05:25:36.548 --> 05:25:36.558 align:start position:0%
um and what i would also argue is is a
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
very mission critical first step
 
05:25:38.958 --> 05:25:39.750 align:start position:0%
very mission critical first step
for

05:25:39.750 --> 05:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:25:39.760 --> 05:25:40.868 align:start position:0%
for
uh

05:25:40.868 --> 05:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
should the law be signed should should
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
the bill be signed and passed and be
 
05:25:46.788 --> 05:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
signed into law
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
would certainly be a necessary first
 
05:25:49.990 --> 05:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
step forward to be
 
05:25:52.548 --> 05:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
successful we don't want to be
 
05:25:52.558 --> 05:25:54.868 align:start position:0%
successful we don't want to be
asking

05:25:54.868 --> 05:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
asking
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
companies that do this sort of thing to
 
05:25:58.708 --> 05:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
go through a process and not have not
 
05:26:00.390 --> 05:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
have the
 
05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
foundation to to provide that support to
 
05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
back it up
 
05:26:06.548 --> 05:26:06.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a unique opportunity
 
05:26:09.030 --> 05:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
to be a leader in minimizing the effects
 
05:26:12.070 --> 05:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
on pfas by eliminating and reducing pfas
 
05:26:14.788 --> 05:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
in both household and commercial sources
 
05:26:17.190 --> 05:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
and the products are numerous
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh microwave popcorn bags dental dental
 
05:26:20.160 --> 05:26:21.110 align:start position:0%
uh microwave popcorn bags dental dental
floss

05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
floss
 
05:26:23.350 --> 05:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh things that the
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
items that we take for granted our daily
 
05:26:27.430 --> 05:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
basis you know once we're done with them
 
05:26:29.190 --> 05:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
and once we use them they get discarded
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the consequence consequently when
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
they're discarded generally ends up in
 
05:26:37.030 --> 05:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
our landfills so
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
from my standpoint it's it's it's
 
05:26:40.830 --> 05:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
important to realize
 
05:26:43.270 --> 05:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
that there are certain landfills in new
 
05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire that do have pfos sitting
 
05:26:47.670 --> 05:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
sitting underneath the cap and some of
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
those landfills are beginning to to
 
05:26:51.990 --> 05:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
leach out into our groundwater into our
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
surface water so i would i would suggest
 
05:26:58.230 --> 05:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
to all of you that if by imposing this
 
05:27:00.548 --> 05:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
type of
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
restriction on phospholadine products
 
05:27:04.548 --> 05:27:04.558 align:start position:0%
we're actually going to be
 
05:27:04.558 --> 05:27:05.750 align:start position:0%
we're actually going to be
protecting

05:27:05.750 --> 05:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
05:27:07.910 --> 05:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
the new generations of landfills that
 
05:27:10.150 --> 05:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
the state regretfully is going to have
 
05:27:11.750 --> 05:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be dealing with over the next couple
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
years as we as we move forward
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
so what i would say to you is that i
 
05:27:17.430 --> 05:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
certainly would urge passage
 
05:27:19.590 --> 05:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
of house bill 1589
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
but i i am flexible because
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
this is something brand new
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
i know maine kind of
 
05:27:28.390 --> 05:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
went out on their own kind of like a
 
05:27:30.548 --> 05:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
brave new world kind of thing they they
 
05:27:32.230 --> 05:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
jumped into the bathtub without checking
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
the temperature to see whether it was
 
05:27:35.270 --> 05:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
hot water or cold water they just
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
decided to do it
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
i certainly would embrace any
 
05:27:41.750 --> 05:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh suggestions legislatively or from d
 
05:27:45.030 --> 05:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
from des as to what would be
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
should you not agree with my agree with
 
05:27:49.510 --> 05:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
the law that i'm proposing what would be
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
a reasonable and systemic process to
 
05:27:54.788 --> 05:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
address these specific pro
 
05:27:56.390 --> 05:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
pfas products
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
that could have a long lasting
 
05:27:59.040 --> 05:28:00.628 align:start position:0%
that could have a long lasting
impact

05:28:00.628 --> 05:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
impact
 
05:28:02.948 --> 05:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
not just on on public health but also on
 
05:28:05.590 --> 05:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
the landfills that these products do
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
fill so

you for being here and taking my
 
05:28:32.310 --> 05:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
question which is
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
who if any stakeholders did you involve
 
05:28:36.708 --> 05:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
in when you put this bill together which
 
05:28:39.110 --> 05:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
i i understand is clearly modeled on on
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
what maine has done candidly no one me
 
05:28:45.510 --> 05:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
i um i actually have a good friend that
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
lives in maine
 
05:28:49.590 --> 05:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
that is has a professional relationship
 
05:28:50.708 --> 05:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:28:52.868 --> 05:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
main sponsor uh senator rick bennett out
 
05:28:57.190 --> 05:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
of oxford and uh i i had a conversation
 
05:28:58.390 --> 05:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
with him about
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
his goals and his intentions and
 
05:29:03.030 --> 05:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know i'm a new i'm a newly elected
 
05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
state representative so it's probably
 
05:29:06.310 --> 05:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
full hearty to
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
not go out and embrace um the agency
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
that would be impacted and certainly
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know my legislative colleagues on
 
05:29:16.230 --> 05:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle so if anybody's
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
offended i certainly do i certainly do
 
05:29:20.948 --> 05:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
apologize but i wanted to
 
05:29:23.590 --> 05:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
at least begin the conversation
 
05:29:23.600 --> 05:29:24.628 align:start position:0%
at least begin the conversation
that

05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
this is potentially a problem that new
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire is going to have to address
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i would rather be proactive and put
 
05:29:34.310 --> 05:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
it on everybody's radar than to
 
05:29:35.910 --> 05:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
wondering why we didn't address it and
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're reacting to a problem
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
but i thank you for the question it's a
 
05:29:41.270 --> 05:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
fair one thank you
 
05:29:44.390 --> 05:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:29:46.150 --> 05:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:29:47.910 --> 05:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
floyd good afternoon how are you good
 
05:29:49.510 --> 05:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you good to see you good to see
 
05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
you i want to thank you for bringing
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
forward this legislation i think it's
 
05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
very important uh this might be a
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
question for des but um the amount of
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
money that it would cost to fund an
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
individual to you know to manage this
 
05:30:04.230 --> 05:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
could you see maybe this money coming
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
privately from
 
05:30:07.040 --> 05:30:08.070 align:start position:0%
privately from
so

05:30:08.070 --> 05:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
just a a quick pivot i serve on the um i
 
05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
serve on the new hampshire drinking
 
05:30:14.230 --> 05:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater advisory
 
05:30:14.240 --> 05:30:15.190 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater advisory
commission

05:30:15.190 --> 05:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:30:17.910 --> 05:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
commission was tasked with
 
05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
investing 250 some odd million dollars
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
from the mtbe settlement fund to address
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
four specific water issues impacting
 
05:30:26.878 --> 05:30:28.708 align:start position:0%
four specific water issues impacting
infrastructure

05:30:28.708 --> 05:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
source water development source water
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
protection in in water quality and for
 
05:30:35.670 --> 05:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
the last for the last four and a half
 
05:30:37.270 --> 05:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
years that i've been on the commission
 
05:30:39.030 --> 05:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
we've done so we've done some amazing
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
amazing work with that money
 
05:30:40.958 --> 05:30:41.750 align:start position:0%
amazing work with that money
so

05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:43.830 --> 05:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
using that as analogous to what we're
 
05:30:45.670 --> 05:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
talking about now i think there's a
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
unique opportunity to create some type
 
05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
of a trust fund or an endowment to begin
 
05:30:53.750 --> 05:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
to tackle these particular issues
 
05:30:56.150 --> 05:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
and again it's again as i alluded to
 
05:30:57.990 --> 05:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
previously it's going to take it's going
 
05:30:59.910 --> 05:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
to take a certain amount of capital to
 
05:31:02.230 --> 05:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
start the to start a program like this
 
05:31:04.708 --> 05:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
up to manage what we're what we're you
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
know what we're seeking to do and i
 
05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
would think
 
05:31:08.558 --> 05:31:09.590 align:start position:0%
would think
that

05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:09.600 --> 05:31:10.390 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:31:10.390 --> 05:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:10.400 --> 05:31:12.070 align:start position:0%
um
as

05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:31:14.628 --> 05:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
companies if if the law does get enacted
 
05:31:15.670 --> 05:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
it means companies are gonna have to
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
pivot to different technologies and
 
05:31:18.788 --> 05:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have to phase out what
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
they're using then yeah i think there's
 
05:31:22.390 --> 05:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
a unique opportunity
 
05:31:24.628 --> 05:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
for for for private contributions to
 
05:31:26.548 --> 05:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
contribute to an endowment
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
and you know again not the not that
 
05:31:30.788 --> 05:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
we're fans of studies or commissions or
 
05:31:32.708 --> 05:31:32.718 align:start position:0%
anything to that effect but an endowment
 
05:31:34.230 --> 05:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
i think could have a far
 
05:31:36.788 --> 05:31:36.798 align:start position:0%
more reaching impact on tackling this
 
05:31:38.948 --> 05:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
issue knowing full well that there's you
 
05:31:40.708 --> 05:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
know there's this private there's a
 
05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
private corpus that's being used to
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
interact with municipalities that may be
 
05:31:47.590 --> 05:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
impacted by this and having as you know
 
05:31:48.788 --> 05:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
not to be cliche but to have a
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
far-reaching impact in in remediating
 
05:31:53.990 --> 05:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
the problem so i yeah i would say
 
05:31:55.750 --> 05:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
coming full circle yes i i think that
 
05:31:57.990 --> 05:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
would be an interesting solution whether
 
05:31:59.110 --> 05:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
or not it's
 
05:32:01.190 --> 05:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's feasible and palatable is is a
 
05:32:03.430 --> 05:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
different story but i agree with you
 
05:32:05.430 --> 05:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thanks for coming
 
05:32:08.948 --> 05:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
on before our committee with this um
 
05:32:10.628 --> 05:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
issue right here
 
05:32:12.868 --> 05:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i apologize it's okay
 
05:32:12.878 --> 05:32:14.310 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i apologize it's okay
um

05:32:14.310 --> 05:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
my question is that you were um were
 
05:32:18.868 --> 05:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
basing this on legislation legislation
 
05:32:20.230 --> 05:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
that passed in the state of maine
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
correct another very small state correct
 
05:32:25.350 --> 05:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
when is it effective in that state and
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
it's already effective now it's
 
05:32:29.590 --> 05:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
effective now and has and what is the
 
05:32:33.430 --> 05:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
impact of nationally produced products
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
and their distribution to the state of
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
maine it's a good question i don't have
 
05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
an answer i'd be more than happy to
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
reach out to my resources and get you an
 
05:32:43.190 --> 05:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you
 
05:32:47.750 --> 05:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
is what what maine did went global the
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
guardian picked it up
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
wall street journal picked it up because
 
05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
it is legitimately the first ban
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
on pfas products worldwide
 
05:32:58.628 --> 05:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
first legitimate ban on pfas products so
 
05:33:00.868 --> 05:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
it it got global it got global coverage
 
05:33:03.270 --> 05:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's very popular
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
um the the legislation is popular over
 
05:33:08.310 --> 05:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
in europe europe being um
 
05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
i think a little bit more savvy um and
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
obviously you know which each individual
 
05:33:13.830 --> 05:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know this there's a cultural
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
component to all the individual
 
05:33:17.590 --> 05:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
countries in europe so i think they they
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
get they get the the long term impacts
 
05:33:23.590 --> 05:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
of that but as far as the immediate
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
impact to the state of maine i'm not
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
privy but i'd be more than happy to to
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
research that foiling circle back that
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
would be great thank you representative
 
05:33:33.350 --> 05:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
for the question thanks very much um
 
05:33:36.150 --> 05:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
and another question i've got is
 
05:33:39.510 --> 05:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:39.520 --> 05:33:40.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
it's a great question
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
the timeline and again i want to amplify
 
05:33:47.190 --> 05:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
the letter that commissioner scott wrote
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
regarding the the aggressive timeline i
 
05:33:49.200 --> 05:33:50.070 align:start position:0%
regarding the the aggressive timeline i
think

05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:33:50.080 --> 05:33:51.270 align:start position:0%
think
if

05:33:51.270 --> 05:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:33:53.670 --> 05:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about enforceability
 
05:33:56.708 --> 05:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
then i would i would admit readily admit
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:33:57.680 --> 05:33:58.948 align:start position:0%
to you
that

05:33:58.948 --> 05:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:34:01.430 --> 05:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
2023 to begin a foundation to implement
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
in 2024
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
probably is not realistic
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
so it would be a conversation to have
 
05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
with des as to what would be a realistic
 
05:34:10.718 --> 05:34:11.830 align:start position:0%
with des as to what would be a realistic
guideline

05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
guideline
 
05:34:11.840 --> 05:34:12.628 align:start position:0%
guideline
of

05:34:12.628 --> 05:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
making the appropriation in their budget
 
05:34:16.948 --> 05:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
having it go through the house and the
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
senate and then actually
 
05:34:21.750 --> 05:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
um you know once
 
05:34:23.190 --> 05:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
if it's kept in the budget and signed
 
05:34:25.350 --> 05:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
into signed into law by the governor
 
05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
then it beca the onus becomes on des to
 
05:34:30.628 --> 05:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
put together a set of criteria you know
 
05:34:33.750 --> 05:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
and depending on what des in their
 
05:34:35.670 --> 05:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
informed opinion would be
 
05:34:38.868 --> 05:34:38.878 align:start position:0%
that would drive the criteria for person
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
working that job i think would
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
would take some time and as i think all
 
05:34:45.430 --> 05:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
of us
 
05:34:50.070 --> 05:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
small businesses today are struggling to
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
put people
 
05:34:55.830 --> 05:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
in in in coffee shops i was i was at
 
05:34:57.270 --> 05:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
einstein's and they only have one person
 
05:34:59.110 --> 05:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
working the counter because the
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
two people that were going to be there
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
were out six so i think
 
05:35:04.390 --> 05:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
that that is analogous to are we going
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to find somebody that's going
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
to want to apply for the job to be able
 
05:35:09.510 --> 05:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
to do the job that we're tasking them to
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
do so i think the timeline
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
based on
 
05:35:15.670 --> 05:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
how i how i
 
05:35:17.830 --> 05:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
wrote the law is is overly aggressive
 
05:35:19.270 --> 05:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i certainly would want to circle
 
05:35:21.670 --> 05:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
that back to a more appropriate timeline
 
05:35:21.680 --> 05:35:22.948 align:start position:0%
that back to a more appropriate timeline
where

05:35:22.948 --> 05:35:22.958 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
criteria can be created
 
05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
processes and protocols can be created
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
and you know putting out the appropriate
 
05:35:30.400 --> 05:35:31.510 align:start position:0%
and you know putting out the appropriate
um

05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:34.150 --> 05:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
one ad for for assistance and so that
 
05:35:36.548 --> 05:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
des can actually interview and vet
 
05:35:39.590 --> 05:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
candidates that would be appropriate so
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's a fair question and i appreciate it
 
05:35:43.430 --> 05:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:35:51.350 --> 05:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:51.360 --> 05:35:54.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:57.590 --> 05:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
how is maine funding its uh
 
05:36:00.070 --> 05:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
legislation if i remember correctly
 
05:36:02.390 --> 05:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
governor mills appropriated 40 million
 
05:36:02.400 --> 05:36:05.030 align:start position:0%
governor mills appropriated 40 million
dollars

05:36:05.030 --> 05:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:36:07.270 --> 05:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
05:36:07.280 --> 05:36:09.190 align:start position:0%
i don't
again

05:36:09.190 --> 05:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:36:12.310 --> 05:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'm relying on
 
05:36:14.708 --> 05:36:14.718 align:start position:0%
testimony that i read and also
 
05:36:16.390 --> 05:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
quite candidly the portland press herald
 
05:36:17.190 --> 05:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
lewiston sun journal 4 for the reporting
 
05:36:20.548 --> 05:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
that occurred but it was governor mills
 
05:36:22.708 --> 05:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
that appropriated 40 million dollars
 
05:36:24.548 --> 05:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
but i think the 40 million was combined
 
05:36:26.708 --> 05:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
with two other pfos bills that passed
 
05:36:28.310 --> 05:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
simultaneously as part of a larger
 
05:36:28.320 --> 05:36:29.350 align:start position:0%
simultaneously as part of a larger
package

05:36:29.350 --> 05:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
package
 
05:36:31.430 --> 05:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
so it's a fair question i'd be more than
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
happy to figure out what was the total
 
05:36:35.590 --> 05:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
dollar amount appropriated to getting
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
that program up and running
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative woods
 
05:36:43.670 --> 05:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um if i could ask
 
05:36:46.310 --> 05:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
my question is would you believe a very
 
05:36:51.910 --> 05:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
famous philosopher who said this is deja
 
05:36:53.670 --> 05:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
vu all over again
 
05:36:55.510 --> 05:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to vujo day that some of this
 
05:36:57.270 --> 05:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
has never happened
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh this is um would you believe this is
 
05:37:02.548 --> 05:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
a very similar problem
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
to lead
 
05:37:04.240 --> 05:37:05.830 align:start position:0%
to lead
yes

05:37:05.830 --> 05:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're going through the same process
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
would you believe that we had a product
 
05:37:12.708 --> 05:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
lead which was in paint made some of the
 
05:37:14.708 --> 05:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
best paint we've ever had
 
05:37:17.350 --> 05:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
we had it in our water pipes
 
05:37:19.830 --> 05:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
we had in our gasoline and we had to
 
05:37:22.150 --> 05:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
make that societal determination
 
05:37:24.430 --> 05:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
that that was no longer
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
compatible uh with our societal goals of
 
05:37:28.868 --> 05:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
health and would you believe that this
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same process i agree i
 
05:37:34.150 --> 05:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree with your doctor dr
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative and i would say
 
05:37:38.230 --> 05:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
to amplify that des still has a lead
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
remediation program that they're still
 
05:37:41.670 --> 05:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
managing in new hampshire and they are
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
still removing lead paint from houses
 
05:37:45.590 --> 05:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
not just you know down here but also up
 
05:37:47.110 --> 05:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the north country
 
05:37:49.430 --> 05:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
on commissions okay there you go
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:52.150 --> 05:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you very much for your
 
05:37:54.628 --> 05:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
testimony okay again my apologies to my

okay so now we have uh department of des
 
05:38:16.868 --> 05:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:21.270 --> 05:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%

we appreciate the opportunity to testify

on house bill 1589.
 
05:38:39.750 --> 05:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh to be clear we're not taking a
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
position on this bill um but we did
 
05:38:43.990 --> 05:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
identify some concerns uh and i think
 
05:38:46.150 --> 05:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative boyd the sponsor uh
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
highlighted some of those um that we
 
05:38:49.990 --> 05:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with the committee and
 
05:38:51.030 --> 05:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
first of all i want to say i want to
 
05:38:52.868 --> 05:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
thank the sponsor representative boyd
 
05:38:54.628 --> 05:38:54.638 align:start position:0%
has been a great leader in the merrimack
 
05:38:54.638 --> 05:38:55.750 align:start position:0%
has been a great leader in the merrimack
area

05:38:55.750 --> 05:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
area
 
05:38:57.830 --> 05:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
where we have a lot of pfas problems
 
05:38:59.590 --> 05:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
that we've been dealing with
 
05:39:02.390 --> 05:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
the agency has been struggling with and
 
05:39:04.788 --> 05:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
working very hard to address
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
very widespread pfas contamination in
 
05:39:08.948 --> 05:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
groundwater both on the seacoast and in
 
05:39:12.070 --> 05:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire since 2014 and in
 
05:39:14.948 --> 05:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire since 2016. so
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
this is something that has dominated
 
05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
much of our time and resources for for
 
05:39:20.470 --> 05:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
good reason
 
05:39:20.480 --> 05:39:21.270 align:start position:0%
good reason
and

05:39:21.270 --> 05:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize that we do support
 
05:39:24.948 --> 05:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
really any efforts that can help to
 
05:39:26.708 --> 05:39:26.718 align:start position:0%
reduce exposure of new hampshire
 
05:39:28.628 --> 05:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
citizens to pfas
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh having said that the concerns that
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
we've identified for this bill are
 
05:39:34.548 --> 05:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
related as it's been discussed already
 
05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
to resources it's a it's a um
 
05:39:40.230 --> 05:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
as representative boyd indicated sort of
 
05:39:42.070 --> 05:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
a cutting-edge bill doing something
 
05:39:43.430 --> 05:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's not really being done in other
 
05:39:45.430 --> 05:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
parts of the country yet
 
05:39:48.070 --> 05:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
and that maine was the leader on
 
05:39:48.080 --> 05:39:49.030 align:start position:0%
and that maine was the leader on
we

05:39:49.030 --> 05:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
we have some history in the program in
 
05:39:53.670 --> 05:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
the department of dealing with a similar
 
05:39:55.750 --> 05:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
program and that would be with mercury
 
05:39:58.390 --> 05:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
and switches and mercury added products
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
which we worked on many years ago so
 
05:40:01.590 --> 05:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
this is not something that we would be
 
05:40:04.150 --> 05:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
unable to do but i think as the bill is
 
05:40:07.590 --> 05:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
crafted um it is uh as has been
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
discussed a little bit ambitious in
 
05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
terms of timing that it would require us
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
to set up a program
 
05:40:15.190 --> 05:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh do uh rule making do a lot of
 
05:40:17.430 --> 05:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
outreach and then get going by january
 
05:40:19.830 --> 05:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
23 which would be a given that this bill
 
05:40:21.430 --> 05:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
had passed would likely be signed into
 
05:40:24.548 --> 05:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
law in uh in the summer of 22 um that's
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to give us very little time to get
 
05:40:28.470 --> 05:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
underway so if if a bill like this were
 
05:40:31.270 --> 05:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
to pass we would like to see much more
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
realistic timelines in it
 
05:40:33.360 --> 05:40:34.548 align:start position:0%
realistic timelines in it
um

05:40:34.548 --> 05:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
you know and i guess if you think about
 
05:40:38.708 --> 05:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
the way the budget process works we'll
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
be working on a budget this summer for
 
05:40:43.510 --> 05:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
implementation in uh you know the new
 
05:40:45.430 --> 05:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
the new budget biennium would start in
 
05:40:47.190 --> 05:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
july of 23.
 
05:40:50.868 --> 05:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
so um or excuse me july 24 so so you
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
know if we looked at something where we
 
05:40:54.070 --> 05:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
could work our
 
05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
our needs and our resource requirements
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
into the budget that would make it much
 
05:41:00.868 --> 05:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
more easy for us to to implement it um
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'll also mention that regionally um
 
05:41:06.390 --> 05:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
there are some uh programs that that
 
05:41:08.150 --> 05:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
could make implementation of this kind
 
05:41:09.910 --> 05:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation much easier for
 
05:41:11.590 --> 05:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
individual states if this is something
 
05:41:13.990 --> 05:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
that were to happen across many states
 
05:41:16.310 --> 05:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
or regionally or even nationally
 
05:41:18.070 --> 05:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
there is precedent for
 
05:41:19.910 --> 05:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
organizations that do the kind of data
 
05:41:21.510 --> 05:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
collection that we
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
that would be required by a bill like
 
05:41:26.150 --> 05:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
this and centralize that manufacturers
 
05:41:27.510 --> 05:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
tend to like that because then they have
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
one reporting authority they can go to
 
05:41:30.948 --> 05:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
and it covers them for the whole country
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
or the region so that's something that i
 
05:41:34.470 --> 05:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
think you know new hampshire is not
 
05:41:36.150 --> 05:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
typically on the bleeding edge of these
 
05:41:38.548 --> 05:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh of uh
 
05:41:40.548 --> 05:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
initiatives um we're going to be
 
05:41:43.110 --> 05:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
watching and i i have you know
 
05:41:44.548 --> 05:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
colleagues in maine that i'll be
 
05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
communicating with as they go through
 
05:41:47.830 --> 05:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
this implementation process and i'm sure
 
05:41:49.430 --> 05:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
we'll learn a lot
 
05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
but having said that that really
 
05:41:53.430 --> 05:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
describes our concerns about uh
 
05:41:55.030 --> 05:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
about this bill and we'll be happy to
 
05:41:59.350 --> 05:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:02.150 --> 05:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative hebert
 
05:42:06.868 --> 05:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:10.470 --> 05:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
have you had the time
 
05:42:14.070 --> 05:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
to research whether or not there might
 
05:42:17.350 --> 05:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
be federal funds
 
05:42:19.030 --> 05:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
similar to the
 
05:42:21.510 --> 05:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
efforts like brownfields efforts or
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
other efforts that have been funded in
 
05:42:24.390 --> 05:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
the past
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
is there anything
 
05:42:25.840 --> 05:42:27.430 align:start position:0%
is there anything
uh

05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:42:29.590 --> 05:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
in that area that the funding might be
 
05:42:31.190 --> 05:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
able to
 
05:42:35.110 --> 05:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
assist you know our ability to to do the
 
05:42:36.708 --> 05:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
what the cleanup is
 
05:42:38.470 --> 05:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
it is possible we've not done any of
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
that research yet but that's certainly
 
05:42:42.868 --> 05:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
something we could look at
 
05:42:45.110 --> 05:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for coming and
 
05:42:47.760 --> 05:42:49.750 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for coming and
testifying

05:42:49.750 --> 05:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
i wonder
 
05:42:54.548 --> 05:42:54.558 align:start position:0%
since we've had experiences with
 
05:42:59.190 --> 05:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
lead and with mercury
 
05:42:59.200 --> 05:43:00.830 align:start position:0%
lead and with mercury
whether

05:43:00.830 --> 05:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
whether
 
05:43:03.430 --> 05:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is um is
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
would would
 
05:43:07.590 --> 05:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
pardon me would whether we would be
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
better off
 
05:43:11.990 --> 05:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the sale
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
of products that
 
05:43:21.190 --> 05:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
have that contain pfas or should we be
 
05:43:22.788 --> 05:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
spending our time
 
05:43:24.948 --> 05:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
first on
 
05:43:26.948 --> 05:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
on waste on
 
05:43:29.030 --> 05:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
on containing
 
05:43:31.590 --> 05:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
it once it's no longer when it's thrown
 
05:43:33.510 --> 05:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the you know then
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the dump or wherever it goes
 
05:43:38.150 --> 05:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question yeah and
 
05:43:41.110 --> 05:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
in essence for for really um
 
05:43:42.948 --> 05:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
we started working pretty hard when we
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
determined that there was groundwater
 
05:43:46.708 --> 05:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
contamination in peace the peace trade
 
05:43:49.030 --> 05:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
port in 2014
 
05:43:51.510 --> 05:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
but that was largely a superfund effort
 
05:43:55.510 --> 05:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
and then in 2016 really it just
 
05:43:56.708 --> 05:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
with what happened in southern new
 
05:43:58.310 --> 05:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the widespread detection
 
05:43:59.510 --> 05:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
of groundwater and drinking water
 
05:43:59.520 --> 05:44:00.868 align:start position:0%
of groundwater and drinking water
contamination

05:44:00.868 --> 05:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
05:44:03.030 --> 05:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's when we've been you know really
 
05:44:03.040 --> 05:44:03.830 align:start position:0%
that's when we've been you know really
uh

05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:05.110 --> 05:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
putting all the resources we could
 
05:44:07.350 --> 05:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
possibly put to pfas and and that and
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
most of that work has been about in the
 
05:44:11.270 --> 05:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
first instance making sure that people
 
05:44:13.030 --> 05:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
aren't drinking contaminated water that
 
05:44:15.270 --> 05:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
if they're well's impacted that they in
 
05:44:17.190 --> 05:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
the first instance get drink you know
 
05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
bottled water or some kind of treatment
 
05:44:21.510 --> 05:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
on and then we've also been working and
 
05:44:21.520 --> 05:44:22.868 align:start position:0%
on and then we've also been working and
with

05:44:22.868 --> 05:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:44:24.628 --> 05:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
significant success but we've got more
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
in extending public water systems for
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
connection for people to connect to
 
05:44:31.910 --> 05:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
so that's been our primary but in the
 
05:44:33.990 --> 05:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
process of that we've also looked at you
 
05:44:35.430 --> 05:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
know what we have at our landfills we
 
05:44:37.750 --> 05:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
know as representative boyd indicated
 
05:44:40.708 --> 05:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
there's substantial contributions of
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
waste that go into a landfill that do
 
05:44:45.030 --> 05:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
contain pfas we have had all of our
 
05:44:48.788 --> 05:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
operating landfills and a number of
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
closed landfills where we still can get
 
05:44:52.868 --> 05:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
a leachate sample sample their leachate
 
05:44:56.548 --> 05:44:56.558 align:start position:0%
for pfast and uniformly we find pfast in
 
05:44:58.070 --> 05:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
all of the leachate from all those
 
05:44:58.080 --> 05:44:59.190 align:start position:0%
all of the leachate from all those
landfills

05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
05:45:01.590 --> 05:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at that and basically
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
the way that leachate is handled right
 
05:45:03.360 --> 05:45:04.150 align:start position:0%
the way that leachate is handled right
now

05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:45:07.510 --> 05:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
it is typically collected at a landfill
 
05:45:09.190 --> 05:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
trucked to wastewater treatment
 
05:45:11.590 --> 05:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
facilities and then integrated into the
 
05:45:13.750 --> 05:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities influent
 
05:45:15.270 --> 05:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
for treatment
 
05:45:17.430 --> 05:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
those processes don't really effectively
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
treat pfas compounds what they really do
 
05:45:22.150 --> 05:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
is distribute some of it to the to the
 
05:45:24.628 --> 05:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
sludge and some of it goes out in the
 
05:45:26.470 --> 05:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
actual water this just wastewater
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
effluent that's discharged in most cases
 
05:45:31.750 --> 05:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
to a river as a receiving stream
 
05:45:33.750 --> 05:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's the bad news the good news is is
 
05:45:36.548 --> 05:45:36.558 align:start position:0%
that in those cases we are not seeing
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
resulting concentrations in those rivers
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that that cause concern having said
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
that it's still not a good story right
 
05:45:45.910 --> 05:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
and so we're looking at determining what
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
05:45:49.270 --> 05:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
to control that at the source at least
 
05:45:51.270 --> 05:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
at the source of the leachate we're
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
looking at issues of you know and there
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
are already um one or more facilities in
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that do some form of
 
05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
leachate treatment prior to sending it
 
05:46:02.070 --> 05:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
to a wastewater facility so that's
 
05:46:03.190 --> 05:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
something that's still a work in
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
progress but
 
05:46:05.990 --> 05:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
the short answer to your question is yes
 
05:46:07.510 --> 05:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
we need to be looking at that waste
 
05:46:12.310 --> 05:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:15.750 --> 05:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
well yep representative billiam
 
05:46:17.270 --> 05:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:46:20.708 --> 05:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
my question um is the timeline um the
 
05:46:22.708 --> 05:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
implementation of this bill the only
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
concern you have at this point
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
i think the primary i think the primary
 
05:46:31.030 --> 05:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
concern is the timeline
 
05:46:32.708 --> 05:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
i would also say that
 
05:46:34.708 --> 05:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
it's never
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has often benefited from
 
05:46:38.070 --> 05:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
not being on the cutting edge of these
 
05:46:39.510 --> 05:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
things we have
 
05:46:41.190 --> 05:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
seen programs implemented by other
 
05:46:43.430 --> 05:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
states watched and learned from them and
 
05:46:45.270 --> 05:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
then in many cases been able to come in
 
05:46:48.070 --> 05:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit later and and and implement
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
a program that's more effective so the
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
timeline is our primary concern
 
05:46:52.240 --> 05:46:53.590 align:start position:0%
timeline is our primary concern
um

05:46:53.590 --> 05:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:55.270 --> 05:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on the bill
 
05:46:55.280 --> 05:46:56.150 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on the bill
so

05:46:56.150 --> 05:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure there's much more i can say
 
05:47:00.868 --> 05:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:03.750 --> 05:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:06.628 --> 05:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
got one more card here
 
05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
david jewett
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:16.070 --> 05:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:39.350 --> 05:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:41.190 --> 05:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
05:47:42.868 --> 05:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is dave

which serves as new hampshire statewide
 
05:47:52.868 --> 05:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce for the next
 
05:47:54.868 --> 05:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
three weeks i'm also serving as interim
 
05:47:57.190 --> 05:47:57.200 align:start position:0%

february

05:48:02.150 --> 05:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:04.788 --> 05:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
05:48:06.150 --> 05:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
i've handed out
 
05:48:06.160 --> 05:48:07.670 align:start position:0%
i've handed out
my

05:48:07.670 --> 05:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
testimony so i
 
05:48:11.350 --> 05:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
won't read from it because i know that
 
05:48:13.350 --> 05:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
you're interested in getting on to your
 
05:48:16.230 --> 05:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
next hearing in a timely manner
 
05:48:20.548 --> 05:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
the bia is opposed to this legislation
 
05:48:21.990 --> 05:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
because we think it's not ready for
 
05:48:25.270 --> 05:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
prime time and
 
05:48:26.470 --> 05:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
individuals on your committee asked what
 
05:48:31.270 --> 05:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
i thought was a really good question
 
05:48:33.510 --> 05:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
which was did the sponsor reach out to
 
05:48:36.310 --> 05:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
any other stakeholders or entities or
 
05:48:39.430 --> 05:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
the des or anyone who might have been
 
05:48:41.830 --> 05:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
able and willing to work with them on
 
05:48:44.948 --> 05:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
this legislation to craft something that
 
05:48:48.390 --> 05:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
better able for the state to implement
 
05:48:51.600 --> 05:48:54.070 align:start position:0%
better able for the state to implement
and

05:48:54.070 --> 05:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
what we're most worried about with the
 
05:48:58.628 --> 05:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
bill as is drafted is the impact that it
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
would have on so many products that that
 
05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
are a part of our everyday lives and
 
05:49:07.830 --> 05:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
also products that will be a part of our
 
05:49:12.310 --> 05:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
future especially those concerning
 
05:49:14.708 --> 05:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy products
 
05:49:19.030 --> 05:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
so i would urge the committee to
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
be cautious with this
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
far-reaching legislation
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
and i would invite the sponsor um
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want to suggest a study
 
05:49:30.470 --> 05:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
commission because i've been around a
 
05:49:32.310 --> 05:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
long time and and
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
we you know the less we say about study
 
05:49:35.910 --> 05:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
commissions the better
 
05:49:37.350 --> 05:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have a study
 
05:49:37.360 --> 05:49:38.548 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have a study
commission

05:49:38.548 --> 05:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:49:38.558 --> 05:49:40.070 align:start position:0%
commission
uh

05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
we're able to pull together uh
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who will have impact we're
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
able to put we the bia is able to pull
 
05:49:47.520 --> 05:49:48.948 align:start position:0%
able to put we the bia is able to pull
together

05:49:48.948 --> 05:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:49:51.270 --> 05:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
members from the american chemistry
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
council who will have important
 
05:49:52.878 --> 05:49:54.070 align:start position:0%
council who will have important
information

05:49:54.070 --> 05:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:49:57.270 --> 05:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
the sponsor can bring to this group
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
impacted individuals i was a
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
resident of merrimack for 10 years so
 
05:50:04.150 --> 05:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know i understand the significance
 
05:50:06.548 --> 05:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
of the impact of this issue in in that
 
05:50:09.430 --> 05:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
area and and the importance
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
with finding a solution moving forward
 
05:50:13.110 --> 05:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure that the
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
solution is the right solution
 
05:50:17.510 --> 05:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
so i'd invite the sponsor to reach out
 
05:50:19.350 --> 05:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
to us get us all around the table this
 
05:50:20.708 --> 05:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
is not the type of thing that can be
 
05:50:23.190 --> 05:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
done in in one meeting but we're all
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
willing to sit down
 
05:50:27.190 --> 05:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
and try and come up with
 
05:50:29.350 --> 05:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that i would characterize as
 
05:50:31.750 --> 05:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
being ready for prime time
 
05:50:33.030 --> 05:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair i
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
will be happy to try and answer any
 
05:50:37.430 --> 05:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might have
 
05:50:42.230 --> 05:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:42.240 --> 05:50:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:50:43.430 --> 05:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
b leo thank you mr chair thank you for
 
05:50:46.390 --> 05:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:50:49.430 --> 05:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh your comment was about the um
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
impact on products and manufacturers
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
um can you comment on the impact on
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
human health
 
05:50:57.360 --> 05:50:58.868 align:start position:0%
human health
i

05:50:58.868 --> 05:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:51:02.070 --> 05:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
cannot except to recognize that that
 
05:51:04.868 --> 05:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
pfas has been identified as having an
 
05:51:06.868 --> 05:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
impact on on public health and i'm not
 
05:51:08.948 --> 05:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
trying to minimize that representative
 
05:51:11.030 --> 05:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
polio i'm suggesting
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
that this is an issue we should all be
 
05:51:14.470 --> 05:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
working on
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
to to make improvements and several
 
05:51:21.110 --> 05:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:23.910 --> 05:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
products containing mercury brown fields
 
05:51:26.070 --> 05:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
there are solutions that are available
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
and i believe that to be true with pfas
 
05:51:28.160 --> 05:51:29.110 align:start position:0%
and i believe that to be true with pfas
too

05:51:29.110 --> 05:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:51:31.750 --> 05:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think that it will require a
 
05:51:31.760 --> 05:51:32.948 align:start position:0%
i think that it will require a
thoughtful

05:51:32.948 --> 05:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
thoughtful
 
05:51:35.830 --> 05:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
process with all stakeholders to make
 
05:51:39.030 --> 05:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
sure that any legislation emerging from
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
that is good legislation that is taken
 
05:51:41.680 --> 05:51:42.788 align:start position:0%
that is good legislation that is taken
into

05:51:42.788 --> 05:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:51:46.470 --> 05:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:48.788 --> 05:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
best information on that issue
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
thank you

thank you mr chair thank you for taking

mentioned uh it could have an effect on
 
05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
our future the products that we use in
 
05:52:03.830 --> 05:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
the future could use the library just
 
05:52:05.350 --> 05:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
for my own curiosity you mentioned it
 
05:52:05.360 --> 05:52:06.310 align:start position:0%
for my own curiosity you mentioned it
could

05:52:06.310 --> 05:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
affect products that deal with
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy yes uh thanks for the
 
05:52:12.948 --> 05:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
question um
 
05:52:15.590 --> 05:52:15.600 align:start position:0%

that
 
05:52:38.310 --> 05:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
where there's a pfast component
 
05:52:40.470 --> 05:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
and one of the products i learned about
 
05:52:40.480 --> 05:52:41.830 align:start position:0%
and one of the products i learned about
recently

05:52:41.830 --> 05:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
recently
 
05:52:44.230 --> 05:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
is is products related to offshore wind

a a
 
05:52:53.110 --> 05:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
exciting prospect we're in the very
 
05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
early stages of that but we don't want
 
05:52:55.040 --> 05:52:55.948 align:start position:0%
early stages of that but we don't want
to

05:52:55.948 --> 05:52:55.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:52:58.948 --> 05:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
unintentionally pass legislation
 
05:53:01.990 --> 05:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
that would uh act as an impediment from
 
05:53:02.000 --> 05:53:02.948 align:start position:0%
that would uh act as an impediment from
from

05:53:02.948 --> 05:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:53:10.948 --> 05:53:10.958 align:start position:0%

05:57:28.390 --> 05:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
103 bills um this term so
 
05:57:30.310 --> 05:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
so anyway thank you mr chair members of
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
dave luno i represent the people of
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
hopkinton and concord
 
05:57:38.470 --> 05:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
and and serve on the the education
 
05:57:38.480 --> 05:57:40.628 align:start position:0%
and and serve on the the education
committee

05:57:40.628 --> 05:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:57:45.430 --> 05:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:48.390 --> 05:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's important i think to lay the
 
05:57:50.070 --> 05:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
lay the context
 
05:57:51.670 --> 05:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
but here in new hampshire we're in a
 
05:57:53.430 --> 05:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
public health crisis
 
05:57:55.590 --> 05:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
that nobody could have imagined even a
 
05:57:57.430 --> 05:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
few years ago
 
05:57:59.910 --> 05:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
substance use disorders anxiety and
 
05:58:01.590 --> 05:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
stress at home
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
in schools and in the workplace
 
05:58:06.708 --> 05:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
health care workers at the end of their
 
05:58:06.718 --> 05:58:07.750 align:start position:0%
health care workers at the end of their
rope

05:58:07.750 --> 05:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
rope
 
05:58:10.230 --> 05:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms at capacity all behind
 
05:58:13.510 --> 05:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
all beyond anyone's imagination
 
05:58:17.190 --> 05:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
so here comes house bill 1622
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
and it really uh addresses three core
 
05:58:20.320 --> 05:58:21.430 align:start position:0%
and it really uh addresses three core
elements

05:58:21.430 --> 05:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
elements
 
05:58:22.548 --> 05:58:22.558 align:start position:0%
the first
 
05:58:24.628 --> 05:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
is enforcement of mental health parity
 
05:58:27.350 --> 05:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
laws the second
 
05:58:29.750 --> 05:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
is reimbursement rates
 
05:58:32.470 --> 05:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
are part of that parity
 
05:58:33.830 --> 05:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the third
 
05:58:36.390 --> 05:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
is is it provides accountability to
 
05:58:38.230 --> 05:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
patients and providers
 
05:58:41.270 --> 05:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
through uh private right of action
 
05:58:43.270 --> 05:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to address each each of
 
05:58:44.390 --> 05:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
these three
 
05:58:48.230 --> 05:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh core elements um uh specifically
 
05:58:50.548 --> 05:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
the first one enforcement
 
05:58:52.628 --> 05:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
the bill ensures enforcement of the
 
05:58:54.548 --> 05:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
mental health parity and addiction
 
05:58:56.948 --> 05:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
equity laws that we have
 
05:58:58.948 --> 05:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
established here in new hampshire
 
05:59:01.190 --> 05:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
simply put insurance carriers shouldn't
 
05:59:02.708 --> 05:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
treat folks with mental health or
 
05:59:04.390 --> 05:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
addiction health care
 
05:59:06.788 --> 05:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
needs differently than folks with other
 
05:59:08.868 --> 05:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
health care needs
 
05:59:10.390 --> 05:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers might say they're
 
05:59:11.910 --> 05:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
already doing this
 
05:59:13.990 --> 05:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
and the insurance department might say
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
they aren't receiving any complaints
 
05:59:17.830 --> 05:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
but the fact is
 
05:59:20.230 --> 05:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
one of the largest carriers in the state
 
05:59:21.910 --> 05:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
is not being fair to patients or
 
05:59:24.628 --> 05:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
providers and in many cases has failed
 
05:59:26.708 --> 05:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
to provide timely what are called
 
05:59:26.718 --> 05:59:28.230 align:start position:0%
to provide timely what are called
remittances

05:59:28.230 --> 05:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
remittances
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
to mental health care providers
 
05:59:34.230 --> 05:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
many of these practitioners are solo
 
05:59:37.430 --> 05:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
and these remittances could include uh
 
05:59:37.440 --> 05:59:38.788 align:start position:0%
and these remittances could include uh
payment

05:59:38.788 --> 05:59:38.798 align:start position:0%
payment
 
05:59:40.868 --> 05:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
of the of the services covered by
 
05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
insurance or an explanation of why the
 
05:59:44.948 --> 05:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
claim was denied
 
05:59:47.190 --> 05:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
but no remittances at all
 
05:59:47.200 --> 05:59:48.230 align:start position:0%
but no remittances at all
nothing

05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
05:59:51.910 --> 05:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
no explanation for months
 
05:59:54.310 --> 05:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
the carriers know this is happening
 
05:59:55.830 --> 05:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
they're meeting with the providers to
 
05:59:57.830 --> 05:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
try to settle them down
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
when providers take on a patient with an
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
insurance card
 
06:00:03.670 --> 06:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
they expect to be paid
 
06:00:07.110 --> 06:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
and then nothing no payment no denial
 
06:00:07.120 --> 06:00:08.868 align:start position:0%
and then nothing no payment no denial
nothing

06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
06:00:11.270 --> 06:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
and patients are strung out for months
 
06:00:12.868 --> 06:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
and maybe they're on the hook for paying
 
06:00:14.708 --> 06:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
a denied claim
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
or maybe it's better not to seek
 
06:00:18.548 --> 06:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
treatment at all yeah that's what some
 
06:00:20.868 --> 06:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
patients are thinking maybe it's better
 
06:00:24.150 --> 06:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
not to seek treatment at all
 
06:00:25.990 --> 06:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
so among other things
 
06:00:29.110 --> 06:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1622 sets up a real and
 
06:00:31.270 --> 06:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
meaningful complaint process
 
06:00:33.430 --> 06:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
so people and providers can actually
 
06:00:36.390 --> 06:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
have access to justice and parity
 
06:00:39.270 --> 06:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's about respect
 
06:00:41.350 --> 06:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
back to the core things this bill does
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
number two
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
it makes clear that reimbursement rates
 
06:00:47.910 --> 06:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
for behavioral health services are part
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
of parity
 
06:00:51.350 --> 06:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
in person and remote
 
06:00:53.110 --> 06:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
mental health care reimbursements
 
06:00:56.070 --> 06:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursements should be treated on par
 
06:00:58.788 --> 06:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
with physical health care reimbursements
 
06:01:01.350 --> 06:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
not slowed down not denied because the
 
06:01:03.990 --> 06:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
visit was performed remotely and not
 
06:01:06.310 --> 06:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
held in limbo
 
06:01:08.548 --> 06:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
and finally number three
 
06:01:11.110 --> 06:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
it establishes a private right of action
 
06:01:13.030 --> 06:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
for people and providers to be able to
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
enforce the pre-existing requirement
 
06:01:17.430 --> 06:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
that medicaid expansions reimbursement
 
06:01:19.990 --> 06:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
rates for behavioral health
 
06:01:22.788 --> 06:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
are at a level ensuring access and
 
06:01:22.798 --> 06:01:24.390 align:start position:0%
are at a level ensuring access and
capacity

06:01:24.390 --> 06:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of only four states
 
06:01:28.230 --> 06:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
that do not allow people to hold the
 
06:01:30.390 --> 06:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
insurance department and carriers
 
06:01:33.670 --> 06:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
accountable to follow state laws
 
06:01:35.430 --> 06:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
i've been in this committee before to
 
06:01:37.670 --> 06:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
improve consumer protection law
 
06:01:39.750 --> 06:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
laws the chair knows this
 
06:01:39.760 --> 06:01:40.628 align:start position:0%
laws the chair knows this
and

06:01:40.628 --> 06:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:43.910 --> 06:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
my my work with rsa 358-a
 
06:01:46.070 --> 06:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
to give granite staters the right to
 
06:01:48.230 --> 06:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
challenge the insurance department or an
 
06:01:50.470 --> 06:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier in court
 
06:01:52.788 --> 06:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
but compared to that this is a light
 
06:01:52.798 --> 06:01:53.750 align:start position:0%
but compared to that this is a light
touch

06:01:53.750 --> 06:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
touch
 
06:01:56.230 --> 06:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
under very narrow in very specific
 
06:01:56.240 --> 06:01:57.510 align:start position:0%
under very narrow in very specific
conditions

06:01:57.510 --> 06:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
06:01:58.948 --> 06:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
and if the insurance department is
 
06:02:00.948 --> 06:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
already enforcing the law they shouldn't
 
06:02:02.708 --> 06:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
have a problem with this
 
06:02:05.510 --> 06:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
accountability to our constituents is a
 
06:02:07.430 --> 06:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
06:02:11.350 --> 06:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
so please consider house bill 1622 as a
 
06:02:14.070 --> 06:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
positive step to help granite staters
 
06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
it puts some teeth into the mountain
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
health parity law
 
06:02:19.030 --> 06:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
and it gives patients and providers a
 
06:02:22.150 --> 06:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
path to the quality of care we've all
 
06:02:23.590 --> 06:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
paid for
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to take
 
06:02:24.958 --> 06:02:28.390 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to take
questions

06:02:28.390 --> 06:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:30.390 --> 06:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs thank you mr
 
06:02:31.910 --> 06:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:02:33.990 --> 06:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
question which is
 
06:02:35.590 --> 06:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
when you talk about the complaint
 
06:02:37.990 --> 06:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
process is that strictly for an
 
06:02:40.628 --> 06:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
individual patient or does it cover is
 
06:02:42.390 --> 06:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
this brought more broad in terms of the
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
carrier or population population health
 
06:02:47.670 --> 06:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
or is it just for individuals no it's
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's for both both individual patients
 
06:02:52.548 --> 06:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
as well as providers who feel that that
 
06:02:53.830 --> 06:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
the insurance department needs to
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
intervene on their behalf
 
06:02:59.910 --> 06:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:59.920 --> 06:03:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:03:01.190 --> 06:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:03:03.350 --> 06:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're saying you're not sure whether
 
06:03:05.830 --> 06:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
this is a problem or not that you imply
 
06:03:08.548 --> 06:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
that the department
 
06:03:10.150 --> 06:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
is actually doing something about
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
enforcing no i'm not unsure that it's a
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
that it's a problem or not because i've
 
06:03:16.628 --> 06:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
heard specifically from solo
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
practitioners that that they're in fact
 
06:03:22.070 --> 06:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
not receiving admittance uh remittances
 
06:03:22.080 --> 06:03:23.190 align:start position:0%
not receiving admittance uh remittances
from

06:03:23.190 --> 06:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:03:25.910 --> 06:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
um from from uh carriers
 
06:03:28.390 --> 06:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
and um and so i don't know what the
 
06:03:31.990 --> 06:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
department has um has received uh on
 
06:03:33.510 --> 06:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
this or what interventions the
 
06:03:33.520 --> 06:03:34.470 align:start position:0%
this or what interventions the
department

06:03:34.470 --> 06:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:03:38.470 --> 06:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
has has done on behalf of uh of these uh
 
06:03:40.548 --> 06:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
mental health um practitioners okay so
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
you say remember
 
06:03:43.750 --> 06:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
so they're not paying at all or they're
 
06:03:46.150 --> 06:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
only paying partially not paying
 
06:03:48.230 --> 06:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
full amounts so what was that yeah thank
 
06:03:50.070 --> 06:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
you for the question mr chair when they
 
06:03:52.628 --> 06:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
don't receive a remittance at all
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
they're not getting any payment at all
 
06:03:58.070 --> 06:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
or even an explanation of a denial
 
06:03:59.990 --> 06:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
because the remittance
 
06:04:00.000 --> 06:04:01.030 align:start position:0%
because the remittance
can

06:04:01.030 --> 06:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:04:02.788 --> 06:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
include a payment but it could also
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
include a reason why there's not nothing
 
06:04:06.230 --> 06:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
opinion yeah
 
06:04:07.830 --> 06:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding
 
06:04:07.840 --> 06:04:09.030 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding
okay

06:04:09.030 --> 06:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:04:11.270 --> 06:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
and this is uh
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
anecdotal that you've heard that this is
 
06:04:14.628 --> 06:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
what's occurring
 
06:04:16.868 --> 06:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
and that when you ask the these
 
06:04:18.868 --> 06:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
physicians that have they followed up
 
06:04:20.948 --> 06:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
and they say they get no answer from the
 
06:04:23.510 --> 06:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
no response i i don't know if they've
 
06:04:28.470 --> 06:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
contacted the insurance department um
 
06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
specifically on on this i know that they
 
06:04:33.750 --> 06:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
and and i had it my testimony
 
06:04:36.628 --> 06:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
that uh that they have actively been um
 
06:04:38.628 --> 06:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
been in communication with with a
 
06:04:41.670 --> 06:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
carrier on on this uh on this subject
 
06:04:43.670 --> 06:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
but uh to my understanding there's been
 
06:04:46.390 --> 06:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
no resolution okay
 
06:04:46.400 --> 06:04:47.670 align:start position:0%
no resolution okay

you so good afternoon commission
 
06:05:57.430 --> 06:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative chairman
 
06:06:00.548 --> 06:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
my name is paula rogers and i am here on
 
06:06:02.230 --> 06:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of anthem but i'm also with
 
06:06:04.868 --> 06:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
sabrina dunlop who i'd like to come up
 
06:06:06.948 --> 06:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
because of the issue that's been raised
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
about claims payment and that is an
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
issue directed at anthem and sabrina
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
will have information on that my
 
06:06:16.470 --> 06:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
intention today was to come and talk a
 
06:06:18.788 --> 06:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
bit about the bill itself and they're
 
06:06:20.948 --> 06:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
two separate matters it may not sound
 
06:06:23.990 --> 06:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
like that but it is uh this the issue
 
06:06:26.150 --> 06:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
that anthem is having has nothing to do
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
with mental health parity it has to do
 
06:06:30.230 --> 06:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
with our systems
 
06:06:32.390 --> 06:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
and we own that problem
 
06:06:35.990 --> 06:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
so someone else
 
06:06:39.030 --> 06:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
so i think to just sort of clarify
 
06:06:41.350 --> 06:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
the bill and the relationship to the
 
06:06:43.670 --> 06:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
claims issue i think sabrina who's
 
06:06:46.310 --> 06:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
internal to anthem and i am not now i
 
06:06:48.548 --> 06:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
used to be is probably better positioned
 
06:06:49.670 --> 06:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
to give you
 
06:06:51.990 --> 06:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
some sense of what that is all about
 
06:06:53.830 --> 06:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
what measures are taken
 
06:06:56.548 --> 06:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
being taken by anthem and how we are
 
06:06:59.350 --> 06:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
working with the provider community very
 
06:07:02.390 --> 06:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
aggressively to settle this matter
 
06:07:03.990 --> 06:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
so sabrina i'm going to turn that over
 
06:07:06.070 --> 06:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
to you thank you for letting us be here
 
06:07:08.868 --> 06:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
as a duo i'm sabrina dunlap
 
06:07:08.878 --> 06:07:09.910 align:start position:0%
as a duo i'm sabrina dunlap
um

06:07:09.910 --> 06:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:12.230 --> 06:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to talk to anyone in more
 
06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
detail about this but generally
 
06:07:16.230 --> 06:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
what i think representative luna was
 
06:07:18.628 --> 06:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
referring to are some widespread
 
06:07:21.510 --> 06:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
operational issues anthem has had
 
06:07:23.430 --> 06:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
end of summer into fall
 
06:07:25.030 --> 06:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
i believe we have fully turned the
 
06:07:28.150 --> 06:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
corner on those issues they did result
 
06:07:31.430 --> 06:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
in delayed claims payments in some cases
 
06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
as paula said nothing to do
 
06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
with the parity issue it was a
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
anthem operational issue
 
06:07:37.920 --> 06:07:38.948 align:start position:0%
anthem operational issue
so

06:07:38.948 --> 06:07:38.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:38.958 --> 06:07:40.310 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:07:40.310 --> 06:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:42.070 --> 06:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
we just had our third
 
06:07:43.590 --> 06:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
town hall today
 
06:07:45.750 --> 06:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
for behavioral health providers to come
 
06:07:47.750 --> 06:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
and speak to anthem about any ongoing
 
06:07:49.510 --> 06:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
issues they continue to have
 
06:07:51.030 --> 06:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
as paula mentioned we have been doing a
 
06:07:52.708 --> 06:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
lot of outreach to them
 
06:07:55.030 --> 06:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
to make the situation right
 
06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
06:07:58.708 --> 06:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
that we have made a lot of progress
 
06:08:00.470 --> 06:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
but again i think that that is a
 
06:08:02.788 --> 06:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
completely separate issue from what is
 
06:08:03.990 --> 06:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
before you
 
06:08:06.628 --> 06:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
with this proposed bill
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i might pick up on that because the
 
06:08:11.110 --> 06:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
only way you could conclude that
 
06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
that issue has something to do with
 
06:08:15.990 --> 06:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
parity is if anthem were willfully
 
06:08:18.708 --> 06:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
willfully saying we're just not going to
 
06:08:21.030 --> 06:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
pay these claims and i can assure you
 
06:08:23.270 --> 06:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
that is not the issue at all
 
06:08:25.830 --> 06:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
anthem was in the midst of i think the
 
06:08:28.948 --> 06:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
last of commercials
 
06:08:31.270 --> 06:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
in the anthem network there were 14
 
06:08:33.830 --> 06:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
states moving to the new system and it
 
06:08:35.190 --> 06:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
was moving away from something i
 
06:08:37.990 --> 06:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
remember called asus and going to wgs
 
06:08:40.150 --> 06:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly it was
 
06:08:43.270 --> 06:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
very very choppy and we own that as i
 
06:08:45.270 --> 06:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
said in my initial statements
 
06:08:47.030 --> 06:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
now kind of putting that aside the
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
reason sabrina asked me to come this
 
06:08:51.910 --> 06:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
morning or this afternoon was because i
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
have some
 
06:08:55.430 --> 06:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
some history with the mental health
 
06:08:58.150 --> 06:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
parity issue i certainly am no expert at
 
06:09:00.548 --> 06:09:00.558 align:start position:0%
all it's just by working at anthem for
 
06:09:02.708 --> 06:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
the number of years i did i saw the
 
06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
iteration of the mental health parity
 
06:09:08.948 --> 06:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
federal provisions called mapia
 
06:09:11.590 --> 06:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
is the initials it's a mental health
 
06:09:11.600 --> 06:09:13.110 align:start position:0%
is the initials it's a mental health
um

06:09:13.110 --> 06:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:15.990 --> 06:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's mental health
 
06:09:17.990 --> 06:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
06:09:21.030 --> 06:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
mental parity and and
 
06:09:21.040 --> 06:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
mental parity and and
equity

06:09:21.990 --> 06:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
equity
 
06:09:24.788 --> 06:09:24.798 align:start position:0%
addiction act mental health parody and
 
06:09:27.430 --> 06:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
an equity addiction act and mental
 
06:09:29.510 --> 06:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
health parody first passed its very
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
first bill was way back in 1996 and then
 
06:09:34.070 --> 06:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
in 2008
 
06:09:36.868 --> 06:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
a broadened measure was passed that's
 
06:09:39.750 --> 06:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
when sud came into the mix and mapia
 
06:09:42.310 --> 06:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
became the sort of language about how
 
06:09:44.070 --> 06:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
plans needed to
 
06:09:47.510 --> 06:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
simply step up to the plate and pay sud
 
06:09:49.990 --> 06:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
and mental health providers construct
 
06:09:54.150 --> 06:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
their plans to make sure that as their
 
06:09:56.470 --> 06:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
certificates of coverage were reviewed
 
06:09:58.628 --> 06:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
that it was very clear that the
 
06:10:00.868 --> 06:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
treatment opportunities for med surg
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
conditions behavioral health and sud
 
06:10:06.708 --> 06:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
were comparable
 
06:10:09.270 --> 06:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
that gets you to 2008 at that time it
 
06:10:12.470 --> 06:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
only really covered group plans of 50
 
06:10:14.788 --> 06:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
members or more and it was only with the
 
06:10:16.948 --> 06:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
affordable care act when essential
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
benefits became part of compliance for
 
06:10:21.830 --> 06:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
plans that were going to meet the
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
affordable care act standards they had
 
06:10:26.708 --> 06:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
to include mental health and sud
 
06:10:28.948 --> 06:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
coverage as an essential benefit and
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's when individual plans and small
 
06:10:32.948 --> 06:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
group plans that were going to be sold
 
06:10:34.868 --> 06:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
after 2014 and certainly going to be
 
06:10:37.750 --> 06:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
sold on the exchanges had to come into
 
06:10:41.830 --> 06:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
to compliance with mental health parity
 
06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
since that time
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
plans have been struggling i think
 
06:10:49.030 --> 06:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
regulators have been struggling to try
 
06:10:51.750 --> 06:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
and set up a construct where
 
06:10:54.948 --> 06:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
an inquiry being made by a
 
06:10:54.958 --> 06:10:56.150 align:start position:0%
an inquiry being made by a
patient

06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
patient
 
06:10:57.430 --> 06:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
a provider
 
06:11:00.310 --> 06:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
a company a plan sponsor even a
 
06:11:02.948 --> 06:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
regulator could go and look for guidance
 
06:11:04.868 --> 06:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
on how to make sure that plans were
 
06:11:07.030 --> 06:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
living up to the expectations
 
06:11:10.548 --> 06:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:14.470 --> 06:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:17.830 --> 06:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
if you were to go on the websites of cms
 
06:11:19.350 --> 06:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
the department of labor even the
 
06:11:21.430 --> 06:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
treasury department you can find all
 
06:11:24.470 --> 06:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
sorts of guidance again directed at
 
06:11:24.480 --> 06:11:25.830 align:start position:0%
sorts of guidance again directed at
patients

06:11:25.830 --> 06:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
patients
 
06:11:28.948 --> 06:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
plan sponsors insurers even state
 
06:11:32.150 --> 06:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
regulators giving advice on how the
 
06:11:35.430 --> 06:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
regulator can be assuring that when they
 
06:11:38.310 --> 06:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
are overseeing an insurance operation
 
06:11:40.150 --> 06:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
that they have their finger on the pulse
 
06:11:43.110 --> 06:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
and know what's going on and can be able
 
06:11:45.510 --> 06:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
to check with that pro that insurance
 
06:11:45.520 --> 06:11:46.628 align:start position:0%
to check with that pro that insurance
provider

06:11:46.628 --> 06:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
provider
 
06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
re review that insurance provider's
 
06:11:51.750 --> 06:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
performance through an examination or
 
06:11:53.190 --> 06:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
more casually
 
06:11:55.510 --> 06:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
and simply say yes indeed they are in
 
06:11:57.590 --> 06:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
compliance with the act now in new
 
06:12:01.030 --> 06:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire the regulator in 2017
 
06:12:04.310 --> 06:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
announced exams of three carriers
 
06:12:05.990 --> 06:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
to see whether they were compliant with
 
06:12:08.868 --> 06:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
the mental health uh parity act
 
06:12:10.868 --> 06:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
that was anthem
 
06:12:13.030 --> 06:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
and harvard both in the room today there
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
was a third carry that may not be in the
 
06:12:15.750 --> 06:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
room today
 
06:12:18.708 --> 06:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
that examination went on for 18 months
 
06:12:20.150 --> 06:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
to two years
 
06:12:22.868 --> 06:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
and ultimately a letter was and you can
 
06:12:24.788 --> 06:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
find it on the department website was
 
06:12:27.750 --> 06:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
issued that the department and the plans
 
06:12:29.350 --> 06:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
had settled
 
06:12:32.150 --> 06:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
that the only concern that the
 
06:12:34.788 --> 06:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
department had at that time related to
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's brought up in
 
06:12:39.190 --> 06:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
this bill which is reimbursement and i
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
think the department is still doing
 
06:12:44.310 --> 06:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
a final analysis of reimbursement but to
 
06:12:47.750 --> 06:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
my knowledge at least anthem has no
 
06:12:49.510 --> 06:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
feedback from the department that there
 
06:12:52.390 --> 06:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
is any issue with anthem's reimbursement
 
06:12:54.628 --> 06:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
under mental health parody and while the
 
06:12:55.990 --> 06:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
department was doing this the
 
06:12:59.190 --> 06:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
legislature was not entirely silent so
 
06:13:00.708 --> 06:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
if you go back to i think it's senate
 
06:13:03.990 --> 06:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill 217 272
 
06:13:06.708 --> 06:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
in i think it was probably the
 
06:13:10.548 --> 06:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
19 2019 session there was a bill that
 
06:13:10.558 --> 06:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
19 2019 session there was a bill that
basically

06:13:11.990 --> 06:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
06:13:14.708 --> 06:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
states very directly that the department
 
06:13:17.190 --> 06:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
has the authority to move forward
 
06:13:19.430 --> 06:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
and look to make sure that
 
06:13:21.510 --> 06:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
the insurers that it supervises are
 
06:13:21.520 --> 06:13:22.708 align:start position:0%
the insurers that it supervises are
compliant

06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
compliant
 
06:13:25.110 --> 06:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
with the federal mental health parity
 
06:13:27.510 --> 06:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
act so that's an express
 
06:13:29.830 --> 06:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
maybe unnecessary grant of authority but
 
06:13:31.990 --> 06:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's in there and it has uh house senate
 
06:13:34.548 --> 06:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
bill set 272 from that session
 
06:13:37.270 --> 06:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
and additionally there was one other
 
06:13:41.190 --> 06:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill and i think it was 1632
 
06:13:44.310 --> 06:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:46.708 --> 06:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
from which session was that
 
06:13:48.310 --> 06:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
which if you look at the bill before you
 
06:13:53.750 --> 06:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
i want to ask you to turn the page
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
and look at
 
06:13:58.230 --> 06:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
section roman v
 
06:13:58.240 --> 06:13:59.270 align:start position:0%
section roman v
b

06:13:59.270 --> 06:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
b
 
06:14:10.708 --> 06:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:12.390 --> 06:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
oh you're looking for the statue oh
 
06:14:13.830 --> 06:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay so if you look at the bill before
 
06:14:16.160 --> 06:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
okay so if you look at the bill before
you

06:14:17.590 --> 06:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:14:19.510 --> 06:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
you will see that if it
 
06:14:19.520 --> 06:14:21.830 align:start position:0%
you will see that if it
amends

06:14:21.830 --> 06:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
amends
 
06:14:24.070 --> 06:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
a section of new hampshire law
 
06:14:26.470 --> 06:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
and you will look to see the section two
 
06:14:29.110 --> 06:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill on page two at line nine
 
06:14:32.948 --> 06:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
it amends 417 e12
 
06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
you can see that on line nine
 
06:14:36.868 --> 06:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
that section
 
06:14:38.310 --> 06:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
has also
 
06:14:40.070 --> 06:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
was amended in
 
06:14:40.080 --> 06:14:42.868 align:start position:0%
was amended in
2019

06:14:42.868 --> 06:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
2019
 
06:14:45.670 --> 06:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
on the bill 16 20
 
06:14:45.680 --> 06:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
on the bill 16 20
1639

06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
1639
 
06:14:49.670 --> 06:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
to include language
 
06:14:51.910 --> 06:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
that goes into some detail
 
06:14:54.150 --> 06:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
about how reimbursements are to be
 
06:14:56.310 --> 06:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
looked at by the regulator
 
06:14:59.030 --> 06:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
so you would have to go to the entire
 
06:15:00.788 --> 06:15:00.798 align:start position:0%
provision in the new hampshire insurance
 
06:15:00.798 --> 06:15:02.708 align:start position:0%
provision in the new hampshire insurance
code

06:15:02.708 --> 06:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
code
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
and i find it strange that this bill
 
06:15:07.430 --> 06:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
comes before and doesn't actually give
 
06:15:10.070 --> 06:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
you the entire statute because if you
 
06:15:12.310 --> 06:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
were to go further you would come upon
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
language that was in that second bill
 
06:15:15.510 --> 06:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
that i referenced
 
06:15:17.350 --> 06:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
and that i think that's all it is is
 
06:15:19.510 --> 06:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
adding the word rates
 
06:15:21.750 --> 06:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
yes but what i guess i'm trying to point
 
06:15:23.830 --> 06:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
out is there was if you go in the whole
 
06:15:23.840 --> 06:15:24.868 align:start position:0%
out is there was if you go in the whole
provision

06:15:24.868 --> 06:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
provision
 
06:15:26.390 --> 06:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
06:15:27.670 --> 06:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
is amending
 
06:15:30.390 --> 06:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
you will find language that was provided
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
several years back that goes to some
 
06:15:34.868 --> 06:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
detail about how the department is to
 
06:15:37.270 --> 06:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
look at reimbursement rates
 
06:15:39.350 --> 06:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
and that's absent from this bill which i
 
06:15:41.190 --> 06:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
think is somewhat confusing so when it
 
06:15:43.270 --> 06:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
goes to a subcommittee you want to make
 
06:15:45.270 --> 06:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
sure the subcommittee has the entire
 
06:15:47.670 --> 06:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
section that this bill demands so that
 
06:15:49.830 --> 06:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
you can pick up that additional language
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
because it goes directly to the heart of
 
06:15:53.750 --> 06:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
how the department is to look at
 
06:15:53.760 --> 06:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
how the department is to look at
reimbursement

06:15:55.590 --> 06:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
06:15:56.788 --> 06:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i think is
 
06:15:58.948 --> 06:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
important to know that if you look at
 
06:16:00.628 --> 06:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
federal guidance there's a difference
 
06:16:03.030 --> 06:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
between reimbursement practices and
 
06:16:05.510 --> 06:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates
 
06:16:07.830 --> 06:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
so the federal guidance always points
 
06:16:09.190 --> 06:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
the regulator
 
06:16:11.590 --> 06:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
and the plans we're trying to comply
 
06:16:13.990 --> 06:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
to making sure that is there practices
 
06:16:16.868 --> 06:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
and procedures that have to be equal in
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
treatment med-surg
 
06:16:18.958 --> 06:16:19.670 align:start position:0%
treatment med-surg
to

06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:16:21.510 --> 06:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
sud and bh
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
when it gets to the rates
 
06:16:25.590 --> 06:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
rates may be looked at and may be an
 
06:16:28.390 --> 06:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
indicator to a regulator that there
 
06:16:30.390 --> 06:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
should be further examination and i
 
06:16:31.750 --> 06:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
think that is where the new hampshire
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
insurance department is now with its
 
06:16:33.600 --> 06:16:35.910 align:start position:0%
insurance department is now with its
present

06:16:35.910 --> 06:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
present
 
06:16:37.430 --> 06:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
market conduct
 
06:16:37.440 --> 06:16:38.628 align:start position:0%
market conduct
focus

06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
focus
 
06:16:39.670 --> 06:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:16:41.910 --> 06:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
when that is being looked at the
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
provision i talked about that you would
 
06:16:46.070 --> 06:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
see if you saw this entire section to
 
06:16:48.708 --> 06:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
which this bill applies you would see
 
06:16:50.390 --> 06:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
that that section has three or four
 
06:16:52.628 --> 06:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
paragraphs talking about what the
 
06:16:55.270 --> 06:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
measurement is for the department at
 
06:16:57.030 --> 06:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
that time
 
06:16:59.030 --> 06:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
so tyler brannan is here and he can
 
06:17:00.708 --> 06:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
certainly talk to you about where the
 
06:17:03.190 --> 06:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
department is with his exam but i think
 
06:17:05.030 --> 06:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's important to know that
 
06:17:07.750 --> 06:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
that anthem's
 
06:17:10.390 --> 06:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
concern with the bill is that it's using
 
06:17:12.390 --> 06:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
rates rather than reimbursement
 
06:17:12.400 --> 06:17:14.150 align:start position:0%
rates rather than reimbursement
procedures

06:17:14.150 --> 06:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
06:17:16.708 --> 06:17:16.718 align:start position:0%
and when you talk directly to rates and
 
06:17:18.948 --> 06:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
you will see that in
 
06:17:18.958 --> 06:17:28.470 align:start position:0%
you will see that in
paragraph

06:17:28.470 --> 06:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:30.628 --> 06:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
line line 15 and
 
06:17:33.750 --> 06:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
line 15 yes the word
 
06:17:35.750 --> 06:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then you will see in many places in
 
06:17:40.628 --> 06:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:42.470 --> 06:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
references to rates
 
06:17:45.830 --> 06:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
but you will see it in a strange way it
 
06:17:58.628 --> 06:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
so if you look at for example on page
 
06:18:02.948 --> 06:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
two roman
 
06:18:02.958 --> 06:18:03.910 align:start position:0%
two roman
five

06:18:03.910 --> 06:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
five
 
06:18:05.430 --> 06:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
um it says behavioral health
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates shall be no less
 
06:18:06.958 --> 06:18:08.310 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates shall be no less
extensive

06:18:08.310 --> 06:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
06:18:09.750 --> 06:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
than those provided for physical illness
 
06:18:12.788 --> 06:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
i mean that's just very vague language i
 
06:18:12.798 --> 06:18:13.590 align:start position:0%
i mean that's just very vague language i
think

06:18:13.590 --> 06:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:18:15.430 --> 06:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
introduces unnecessary
 
06:18:17.190 --> 06:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
ambiguity into a process it's already
 
06:18:25.350 --> 06:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:27.750 --> 06:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
and finally i guess one comment about
 
06:18:29.110 --> 06:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
the authority of the insurance
 
06:18:31.350 --> 06:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
department at present
 
06:18:32.708 --> 06:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
there is certainly significant
 
06:18:34.150 --> 06:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
discretionary authority at the
 
06:18:35.590 --> 06:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
department level
 
06:18:37.110 --> 06:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
the bill that i
 
06:18:39.270 --> 06:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
referenced that was passed in
 
06:18:42.390 --> 06:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
2019 also gives direct
 
06:18:44.628 --> 06:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority or directive to the
 
06:18:47.110 --> 06:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
department to enforce the
 
06:18:49.670 --> 06:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
mental health parity act
 
06:18:52.070 --> 06:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
one thing that did come to my mind when
 
06:18:54.310 --> 06:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative luna was speaking is if
 
06:18:56.788 --> 06:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
you look at line 17 of the bill i
 
06:18:59.430 --> 06:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
thought that anything after line 17
 
06:18:59.440 --> 06:19:00.948 align:start position:0%
thought that anything after line 17
actually

06:19:00.948 --> 06:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:19:03.270 --> 06:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh applied to the granite advantage
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
program so when he talked about a
 
06:19:07.430 --> 06:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
private right of action i was quite
 
06:19:09.430 --> 06:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
confused as to what that meant and there
 
06:19:11.590 --> 06:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
was a question about who would have a
 
06:19:13.990 --> 06:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
private right of action i would say in
 
06:19:16.150 --> 06:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
what setting is another question
 
06:19:18.070 --> 06:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
and as far as a private right of action
 
06:19:20.548 --> 06:19:20.558 align:start position:0%
for the average
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
consumer out there right now the way the
 
06:19:23.280 --> 06:19:24.628 align:start position:0%
consumer out there right now the way the
department's

06:19:24.628 --> 06:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
department's
 
06:19:27.030 --> 06:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement is structured it's largely
 
06:19:28.948 --> 06:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
under the unfair insurance trade
 
06:19:31.110 --> 06:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
practices act concept where the
 
06:19:33.350 --> 06:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
department can bring an action of some
 
06:19:36.468 --> 06:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
kind against a producer or a company
 
06:19:39.430 --> 06:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
but the individual consumer does not
 
06:19:41.670 --> 06:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
have a direct avenue through the
 
06:19:44.788 --> 06:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
department to that
 
06:19:47.110 --> 06:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of a recovery
 
06:19:49.750 --> 06:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
the only way they can is if in under the
 
06:19:51.910 --> 06:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
unfair insurance trade practices there
 
06:19:54.150 --> 06:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
is a finding at the department they can
 
06:19:57.350 --> 06:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
then use that finding in a court setting
 
06:20:00.628 --> 06:20:00.638 align:start position:0%
to go further but it's not a direct line
 
06:20:03.190 --> 06:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
for a provider to pursue now the
 
06:20:04.948 --> 06:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
department really will respond to
 
06:20:06.548 --> 06:20:06.558 align:start position:0%
provider complaints and it does
 
06:20:08.468 --> 06:20:08.478 align:start position:0%
participate in provider
 
06:20:10.788 --> 06:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
insurer issues and when
 
06:20:12.868 --> 06:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
representative hunt asked about whether
 
06:20:15.110 --> 06:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
the department was aware of the anthem
 
06:20:17.750 --> 06:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
issue sabrina can talk that directly
 
06:20:19.990 --> 06:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
because there have been conversations
 
06:20:23.350 --> 06:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
with the department about this issue
 
06:20:26.628 --> 06:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
yeah again i'm happy to talk to anyone
 
06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
offline about this there's a lot to
 
06:20:29.990 --> 06:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
discuss but yes the department's fully
 
06:20:33.030 --> 06:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
aware we're in regular contact with them
 
06:20:35.190 --> 06:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
and like i said we're in regular contact
 
06:20:36.948 --> 06:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
with providers as well around these
 
06:20:38.548 --> 06:20:38.558 align:start position:0%
claims issues
 
06:20:40.390 --> 06:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
i just don't think they have anything to
 
06:20:44.310 --> 06:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:44.320 --> 06:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:20:47.590 --> 06:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:51.110 --> 06:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
06:20:54.548 --> 06:20:54.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
06:20:58.070 --> 06:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh so tyler why don't you
 
06:21:00.708 --> 06:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
come up now that we've heard
 
06:21:03.190 --> 06:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
both sides of the issue and
 
06:21:05.430 --> 06:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you tell us how you're still
 
06:21:08.310 --> 06:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
standing in the middle here
 
06:21:10.150 --> 06:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's a common place to be so tyler
 
06:21:11.830 --> 06:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
brandon life and health director with
 
06:21:14.150 --> 06:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire insurance department
 
06:21:15.830 --> 06:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to cover a few things
 
06:21:17.590 --> 06:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
fortunately paula saved me
 
06:21:19.030 --> 06:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
some time talking about the market
 
06:21:21.190 --> 06:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
conduct examinations we did and where we
 
06:21:23.030 --> 06:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
are today which we've been in a
 
06:21:25.510 --> 06:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring period as a part of that exam
 
06:21:27.430 --> 06:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
which means that we're still following
 
06:21:29.110 --> 06:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
the exam process which has the
 
06:21:31.030 --> 06:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the exchange with the
 
06:21:33.750 --> 06:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
carrier and has a certain process we
 
06:21:35.350 --> 06:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
need to follow that in this case has
 
06:21:37.830 --> 06:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
actually taken a year so it's um i think
 
06:21:39.270 --> 06:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate in terms of being able
 
06:21:41.110 --> 06:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
to tell the public or tell the carriers
 
06:21:43.750 --> 06:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
or advocates where we stand in a public
 
06:21:45.670 --> 06:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
setting and hopefully i can say a little
 
06:21:47.910 --> 06:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
more about it in a week or so but uh i
 
06:21:49.750 --> 06:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
think the point is this conversation is
 
06:21:51.670 --> 06:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
going to continue um this is not
 
06:21:53.030 --> 06:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
something we're done with as a state
 
06:21:55.430 --> 06:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
regulator but as it relates to the bill
 
06:21:57.670 --> 06:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
we see this bill as really having two
 
06:22:00.708 --> 06:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
major components to it and the first is
 
06:22:03.670 --> 06:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
about our authority to enforce mapia or
 
06:22:05.350 --> 06:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
i'll refer to it as sort of the parity
 
06:22:07.270 --> 06:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
requirements because as paula mentioned
 
06:22:09.110 --> 06:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
the parity requirements actually stem
 
06:22:10.868 --> 06:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
from a couple of different federal laws
 
06:22:13.430 --> 06:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
including the aca the good news is that
 
06:22:14.468 --> 06:22:14.478 align:start position:0%
the legislative new hampshire
 
06:22:16.230 --> 06:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
legislature passed
 
06:22:17.590 --> 06:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that gives the insurance
 
06:22:19.590 --> 06:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
department the authority to enforce both
 
06:22:22.390 --> 06:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
nepea and the aca so we're in a good
 
06:22:23.830 --> 06:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
place today
 
06:22:25.670 --> 06:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
we do run into the common problem that
 
06:22:27.670 --> 06:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
exists with all new hampshire insurance
 
06:22:30.948 --> 06:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
laws for the self-insured employers and
 
06:22:33.510 --> 06:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
for those that side of the of things
 
06:22:35.110 --> 06:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
which is half the people who walk around
 
06:22:36.948 --> 06:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
with insurance cards the department of
 
06:22:38.948 --> 06:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
labor has direct regulatory authority
 
06:22:40.310 --> 06:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
over those employers and the benefit
 
06:22:42.708 --> 06:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
designs that exist so there is reference
 
06:22:44.150 --> 06:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
to getting support from the department
 
06:22:46.390 --> 06:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
of justice we feel as though we have the
 
06:22:48.628 --> 06:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
authority to enforce empia the aca and
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
relate the laws the department of labor
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
has the authority as well on the
 
06:22:54.310 --> 06:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
employer side so we don't feel the need
 
06:22:55.670 --> 06:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
to involve the department of justice
 
06:22:57.590 --> 06:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
from authority point of view
 
06:22:59.670 --> 06:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
resources are always a concern and
 
06:23:01.510 --> 06:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
indeed while we don't have a position on
 
06:23:02.948 --> 06:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:23:05.430 --> 06:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
satisfying the requirements in this
 
06:23:07.190 --> 06:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
legislation as is described in the
 
06:23:09.510 --> 06:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would require bringing on
 
06:23:11.350 --> 06:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
three newer people
 
06:23:12.628 --> 06:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
on the life and health side the
 
06:23:14.548 --> 06:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
insurance department in market conduct
 
06:23:17.190 --> 06:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
we have five so you'd be quite an
 
06:23:20.548 --> 06:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
expansion of our existing staff
 
06:23:22.070 --> 06:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
the other piece to the bill is about
 
06:23:24.230 --> 06:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
provider reimbursement
 
06:23:25.830 --> 06:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that paula rogers did
 
06:23:27.830 --> 06:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
describe kind of the dynamic that exists
 
06:23:30.070 --> 06:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
there as it relates to parity and it is
 
06:23:32.948 --> 06:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
a common misunderstanding that the mepia
 
06:23:36.150 --> 06:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
or the aca or related laws do require
 
06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
insurers to pay mental health providers
 
06:23:41.190 --> 06:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
at the same level as physical health
 
06:23:43.670 --> 06:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
providers and that's not the case it
 
06:23:45.430 --> 06:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
does relate more to the policies and
 
06:23:47.590 --> 06:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
practices related to reimbursement and
 
06:23:49.510 --> 06:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not that results at the end
 
06:23:51.750 --> 06:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the day and reduce coverage on the
 
06:23:53.830 --> 06:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
mental health side because remember
 
06:23:55.910 --> 06:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
parity is about coverage it's not about
 
06:23:58.468 --> 06:23:58.478 align:start position:0%
making sure providers get paid enough
 
06:23:59.910 --> 06:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i think to the extent that there is
 
06:24:01.990 --> 06:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
language in here requiring sort of
 
06:24:04.070 --> 06:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
parity and reimbursement to mental
 
06:24:06.548 --> 06:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
health providers with physical health
 
06:24:08.548 --> 06:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
we would need a lot more legislative
 
06:24:10.548 --> 06:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
direction than what is here to get i
 
06:24:12.390 --> 06:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
think that the outcomes that are perhaps
 
06:24:14.548 --> 06:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
hoped for with the bill provider
 
06:24:16.310 --> 06:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and parity is kind of an
 
06:24:18.548 --> 06:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
ill-defined concept you're clearly
 
06:24:19.910 --> 06:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with different kinds of
 
06:24:22.548 --> 06:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
providers doing different services often
 
06:24:24.708 --> 06:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
not physicians even on the physical
 
06:24:26.628 --> 06:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
health side of things there are a number
 
06:24:28.548 --> 06:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
of different specialties that are all
 
06:24:30.390 --> 06:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
paid at sort of varying levels for what
 
06:24:32.948 --> 06:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
could be considered similar services
 
06:24:35.030 --> 06:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
one of the common benchmarks that's used
 
06:24:37.270 --> 06:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
is medicare let's say okay well let's
 
06:24:39.110 --> 06:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
give everybody the same amount above
 
06:24:41.110 --> 06:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
medicare does that mean then we're going
 
06:24:43.030 --> 06:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
to end up with the same fee schedule for
 
06:24:44.948 --> 06:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
all mental health providers is there
 
06:24:46.230 --> 06:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
going to be certain assumptions about
 
06:24:48.230 --> 06:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
the physical health providers are you
 
06:24:49.830 --> 06:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
going to combine all the physical health
 
06:24:51.990 --> 06:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
providers and come up with some sort of
 
06:24:53.430 --> 06:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
average or are you going to pick a
 
06:24:55.830 --> 06:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
specialty like primary care are you
 
06:24:57.030 --> 06:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to adopt all the medicare
 
06:24:58.788 --> 06:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursement policies that go with the
 
06:25:00.788 --> 06:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursement levels there are a lot of
 
06:25:03.190 --> 06:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
considerations in this i mean just to do
 
06:25:05.030 --> 06:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
a simple analysis and say mental health
 
06:25:08.468 --> 06:25:08.478 align:start position:0%
providers have paid 110 of medicare pcps
 
06:25:11.110 --> 06:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps 180 of medicare that's sort of a
 
06:25:12.948 --> 06:25:12.958 align:start position:0%
blunt tool but we have done that kind of
 
06:25:15.030 --> 06:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
analysis but actually enforcing a
 
06:25:17.030 --> 06:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
requirement for reimbursement parity
 
06:25:18.628 --> 06:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
would be something different and we
 
06:25:20.628 --> 06:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
would need a lot more detail and as you
 
06:25:22.948 --> 06:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
can imagine fleshing out those details
 
06:25:24.548 --> 06:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
is going to be very controversial
 
06:25:25.990 --> 06:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
because you are talking about how much
 
06:25:29.510 --> 06:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:31.190 --> 06:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
um one of the things i would say though
 
06:25:33.430 --> 06:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
is that the legislation does talk about
 
06:25:35.670 --> 06:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
a reporting requirement and compliance
 
06:25:37.350 --> 06:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
reports coming to the department these
 
06:25:39.430 --> 06:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
reports becoming public
 
06:25:41.750 --> 06:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
the day today we are looking very
 
06:25:43.430 --> 06:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
closely at what the department of labor
 
06:25:46.070 --> 06:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
is requiring of carriers employers in
 
06:25:48.150 --> 06:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
terms of in terms of reporting
 
06:25:50.788 --> 06:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
demonstrating a comparative deny a
 
06:25:52.390 --> 06:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
comparative analysis that shows
 
06:25:55.190 --> 06:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
compliance with parity x
 
06:25:57.990 --> 06:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
mapia and the aca we're actually working
 
06:25:59.110 --> 06:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
with the department of labor to make
 
06:26:00.788 --> 06:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
sure our efforts are aligned with what
 
06:26:02.948 --> 06:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
they're doing the idea being if the
 
06:26:04.390 --> 06:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
carriers have to produce this kind of
 
06:26:07.030 --> 06:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
information at a federal level and
 
06:26:09.430 --> 06:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
create the system to do so we want to
 
06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
piggyback on that as much as possible
 
06:26:13.110 --> 06:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
and not create a different standard
 
06:26:14.310 --> 06:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to be more research
 
06:26:16.230 --> 06:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
intensive but exists for the same
 
06:26:17.830 --> 06:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
purpose which is demonstrating
 
06:26:20.150 --> 06:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
compliance in fact we have requested
 
06:26:22.390 --> 06:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
legislation to clarify new hampshire
 
06:26:24.548 --> 06:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
statute that we're moving that direction
 
06:26:25.910 --> 06:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a senate bill that hopefully
 
06:26:27.990 --> 06:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
will be coming over here
 
06:26:32.150 --> 06:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:33.910 --> 06:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that i think
 
06:26:40.788 --> 06:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:40.798 --> 06:26:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:26:43.750 --> 06:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:46.150 --> 06:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
06:26:48.708 --> 06:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh you always explain things very well
 
06:26:51.030 --> 06:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i i appreciate that i think we all
 
06:26:51.040 --> 06:26:52.390 align:start position:0%
and i i appreciate that i think we all
do

06:26:52.390 --> 06:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:26:54.788 --> 06:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
i just want to check to see
 
06:26:56.708 --> 06:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
06:26:58.868 --> 06:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
if the only changes
 
06:26:59.830 --> 06:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:27:02.708 --> 06:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
only thing that this bill would change
 
06:27:03.750 --> 06:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:27:04.868 --> 06:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
06:27:09.510 --> 06:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
the words in uh in bold boldface
 
06:27:11.430 --> 06:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
in other words it would add
 
06:27:13.670 --> 06:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
it would add the word rates
 
06:27:13.680 --> 06:27:15.110 align:start position:0%
it would add the word rates
in

06:27:15.110 --> 06:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:27:15.120 --> 06:27:16.548 align:start position:0%
in
in

06:27:16.548 --> 06:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:27:18.868 --> 06:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
section two on page two
 
06:27:18.878 --> 06:27:20.070 align:start position:0%
section two on page two
and

06:27:20.070 --> 06:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:27:22.868 --> 06:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh the sentence at the bottom
 
06:27:22.878 --> 06:27:24.788 align:start position:0%
uh the sentence at the bottom
uh

06:27:24.788 --> 06:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:27:27.270 --> 06:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
and if if if that's correct if that's
 
06:27:29.430 --> 06:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
the only thing that is being changed
 
06:27:29.440 --> 06:27:30.628 align:start position:0%
the only thing that is being changed
from

06:27:30.628 --> 06:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:27:30.638 --> 06:27:31.430 align:start position:0%
from
from

06:27:31.430 --> 06:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:27:34.548 --> 06:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
uh what what was what's currently in
 
06:27:36.948 --> 06:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
effect uh what what are what are the
 
06:27:40.070 --> 06:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
implications of that and if if i'm wrong
 
06:27:41.670 --> 06:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
about what's changed would you please
 
06:27:43.270 --> 06:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
06:27:45.110 --> 06:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
so if i understand you're talking about
 
06:27:47.830 --> 06:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
on page 2 line 15 where rates is added
 
06:27:49.830 --> 06:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
you made reference to another section
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
below the other one is with the granite
 
06:27:51.840 --> 06:27:53.030 align:start position:0%
below the other one is with the granite
advantage

06:27:53.030 --> 06:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
06:27:53.040 --> 06:27:54.468 align:start position:0%
advantage
program

06:27:54.468 --> 06:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:27:56.310 --> 06:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
if you're just asking about adding rates
 
06:27:58.948 --> 06:27:58.958 align:start position:0%
to that paragraph that i think raises a
 
06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
number of questions about what it means
 
06:28:03.430 --> 06:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
and what the expectation is
 
06:28:05.350 --> 06:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
so as a regulator to be able to enforce
 
06:28:07.510 --> 06:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
that i think we'd be put into a place
 
06:28:07.520 --> 06:28:08.468 align:start position:0%
that i think we'd be put into a place
where

06:28:08.468 --> 06:28:08.478 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're making a lot of decisions without
 
06:28:18.310 --> 06:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:18.320 --> 06:28:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:28:24.150 --> 06:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:27.590 --> 06:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
got it great thank you
 
06:28:29.990 --> 06:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:28:33.510 --> 06:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh okay now we'll go back to the story
 
06:28:46.628 --> 06:28:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:48.390 --> 06:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair honorable
 
06:28:49.910 --> 06:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is jake
 
06:28:51.830 --> 06:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
berry i'm the vice president of policy
 
06:28:54.070 --> 06:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
and new futures as many of you know new
 
06:28:56.150 --> 06:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
futures is a nonpartisan nonprofit
 
06:28:58.628 --> 06:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
health policy and advocacy organization
 
06:29:00.070 --> 06:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
we've been working for more than 20
 
06:29:01.510 --> 06:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
years to address substance use and
 
06:29:03.750 --> 06:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
mental mental health issues in our state
 
06:29:05.270 --> 06:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
i'm here today not just speaking on
 
06:29:07.110 --> 06:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
behalf of new futures but on uh
 
06:29:08.548 --> 06:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
thousands of granite staters who don't
 
06:29:10.310 --> 06:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
feel they can safely access the
 
06:29:11.830 --> 06:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
legislature and attend hearings in
 
06:29:13.750 --> 06:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
person during this stage dangerous phase
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
06:29:16.310 --> 06:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
i don't want to repeat too much of
 
06:29:17.990 --> 06:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
what's been said this afternoon but i do
 
06:29:19.750 --> 06:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
want to stress new future strong support
 
06:29:21.030 --> 06:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
06:29:22.150 --> 06:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
as you know our state has worked
 
06:29:23.990 --> 06:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
tirelessly in recent years to build a
 
06:29:25.590 --> 06:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
behavioral health treatment system
 
06:29:27.270 --> 06:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
capable of overcoming the ongoing
 
06:29:28.868 --> 06:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
addiction and mental health crises that
 
06:29:30.468 --> 06:29:30.478 align:start position:0%
our stage is facing
 
06:29:32.150 --> 06:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
overall treatment and recovery programs
 
06:29:33.830 --> 06:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
have come a long way but mental health
 
06:29:35.590 --> 06:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
parity remains one of the single biggest
 
06:29:37.510 --> 06:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
obstacles we face in our efforts to
 
06:29:39.030 --> 06:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
overcome these crises and provide
 
06:29:41.670 --> 06:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
treatment services to all those in need
 
06:29:43.590 --> 06:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
as you've heard today federal parity law
 
06:29:45.270 --> 06:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
requires insurance carriers to cover
 
06:29:47.190 --> 06:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance use services
 
06:29:48.708 --> 06:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
the same way they cover medical and
 
06:29:50.788 --> 06:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
surgical services
 
06:29:52.390 --> 06:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
in recent years the insurance department
 
06:29:54.150 --> 06:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
has been working to ensure compliance by
 
06:29:56.468 --> 06:29:56.478 align:start position:0%
educating consumers reviewing regulated
 
06:29:58.390 --> 06:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
insurance plans and investigating market
 
06:29:58.400 --> 06:29:59.430 align:start position:0%
insurance plans and investigating market
conduct

06:29:59.430 --> 06:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
06:29:59.440 --> 06:30:00.230 align:start position:0%
conduct
still

06:30:00.230 --> 06:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
still
 
06:30:01.750 --> 06:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
frequently we hear from patients who are
 
06:30:03.670 --> 06:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
denied coverage patients or providers
 
06:30:05.350 --> 06:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
who are denied coverage or reimbursement
 
06:30:07.110 --> 06:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
for essential mental health or substance
 
06:30:08.868 --> 06:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
use treatment services
 
06:30:10.788 --> 06:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
this not only leaves individuals facing
 
06:30:12.468 --> 06:30:12.478 align:start position:0%
a hefty hefty medical bills that they
 
06:30:14.708 --> 06:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
struggle to afford but it serves as a
 
06:30:16.548 --> 06:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
key deterrent to continued treatment
 
06:30:18.548 --> 06:30:18.558 align:start position:0%
which can lead them to defer medical
 
06:30:20.948 --> 06:30:20.958 align:start position:0%
care until a period of crisis in which
 
06:30:22.788 --> 06:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
they're treated at an emergency room or
 
06:30:24.788 --> 06:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
other high cost locations
 
06:30:26.230 --> 06:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
this leaves our health care system with
 
06:30:27.830 --> 06:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
considerably higher costs and leaves our
 
06:30:30.070 --> 06:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
state caught in the perpetual in these
 
06:30:33.030 --> 06:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
perpetual behavioral health crises
 
06:30:34.548 --> 06:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes to address these
 
06:30:36.150 --> 06:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
concerns by providing the insurance
 
06:30:37.590 --> 06:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
department with important additional
 
06:30:39.190 --> 06:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
tools to better enforce parity
 
06:30:39.200 --> 06:30:40.310 align:start position:0%
tools to better enforce parity
compliance

06:30:40.310 --> 06:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
06:30:41.830 --> 06:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
it would strengthen the department's
 
06:30:43.910 --> 06:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
ability to support consumers to review
 
06:30:45.670 --> 06:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
an investigation of complaints and
 
06:30:47.270 --> 06:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
alleged parity violations and it would
 
06:30:49.510 --> 06:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
require our insurance carriers to make
 
06:30:51.030 --> 06:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
compliance reports available to the
 
06:30:53.270 --> 06:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
public increasing transparency and
 
06:30:55.030 --> 06:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence
 
06:30:56.310 --> 06:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
together these steps would help the
 
06:30:58.548 --> 06:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
department and insurers and our state as
 
06:31:00.628 --> 06:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
a whole to provide equal access to
 
06:31:02.390 --> 06:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
critical mental health and substance use
 
06:31:04.150 --> 06:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
treatment and to move forward in our
 
06:31:05.670 --> 06:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
battle against these behavioral health
 
06:31:05.680 --> 06:31:06.948 align:start position:0%
battle against these behavioral health
crises

06:31:06.948 --> 06:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
crises
 
06:31:08.788 --> 06:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
representative spagnolo a great friend
 
06:31:11.110 --> 06:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
and ally recognized the need
 
06:31:11.120 --> 06:31:11.910 align:start position:0%
and ally recognized the need
whose

06:31:11.910 --> 06:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
whose
 
06:31:13.590 --> 06:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
name is on this bill recognized the need
 
06:31:15.270 --> 06:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
for equal access to these services and
 
06:31:16.948 --> 06:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
he spent much of his time and energy
 
06:31:19.350 --> 06:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
working to increase access support and
 
06:31:19.360 --> 06:31:20.468 align:start position:0%
working to increase access support and
resources

06:31:20.468 --> 06:31:20.478 align:start position:0%
resources
 
06:31:21.990 --> 06:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
this is this bill is a great way to
 
06:31:23.590 --> 06:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
honor his legacy and to continue the
 
06:31:25.990 --> 06:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
battle he devoted so much of his life to
 
06:31:27.830 --> 06:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
with that we ask you to vote
 
06:31:29.510 --> 06:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to pass and i'm happy to
 
06:31:34.468 --> 06:31:34.478 align:start position:0%

06:32:39.830 --> 06:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
here today to speak
 
06:32:41.110 --> 06:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
06:32:43.750 --> 06:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
06:32:46.150 --> 06:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
you've heard about the
 
06:32:47.670 --> 06:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
mental health parity act so i'm not
 
06:32:49.590 --> 06:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
going to go into any details on that i
 
06:32:52.230 --> 06:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
think we've covered that today
 
06:32:54.788 --> 06:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
and you also i laid out some of the
 
06:32:58.150 --> 06:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
background regarding the market conduct
 
06:32:59.750 --> 06:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh study that the
 
06:33:02.468 --> 06:33:02.478 align:start position:0%
insurance department did in my testimony
 
06:33:02.478 --> 06:33:03.750 align:start position:0%
insurance department did in my testimony
um

06:33:03.750 --> 06:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:06.150 --> 06:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
i think one of the the biggest concerns
 
06:33:07.670 --> 06:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:33:12.868 --> 06:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
um that that market conduct analysis did
 
06:33:15.190 --> 06:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
it looked at reimbursement rates
 
06:33:16.788 --> 06:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
and when it saw that there might have
 
06:33:18.468 --> 06:33:18.478 align:start position:0%
been a discrepancy
 
06:33:19.750 --> 06:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
there wasn't really a finding of
 
06:33:22.150 --> 06:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
discrepancy but they asked the providers
 
06:33:22.160 --> 06:33:23.030 align:start position:0%
discrepancy but they asked the providers
to

06:33:23.030 --> 06:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:33:26.230 --> 06:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
show them their policies
 
06:33:28.230 --> 06:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
for how they calculated
 
06:33:30.468 --> 06:33:30.478 align:start position:0%
payment reimbursement for mental health
 
06:33:30.478 --> 06:33:32.468 align:start position:0%
payment reimbursement for mental health
providers

06:33:32.468 --> 06:33:32.478 align:start position:0%
providers
 
06:33:32.478 --> 06:33:33.430 align:start position:0%
providers
and

06:33:33.430 --> 06:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:33:35.590 --> 06:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
i correct me i mean i know paula will
 
06:33:37.510 --> 06:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong here but
 
06:33:37.520 --> 06:33:38.310 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong here but
that

06:33:38.310 --> 06:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:33:40.548 --> 06:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
the insurers weren't able to provide
 
06:33:42.708 --> 06:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
those to the satisfaction of the
 
06:33:47.670 --> 06:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:49.910 --> 06:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
resulted in the settlement agreements
 
06:33:52.868 --> 06:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
that the department has with anthem and
 
06:33:56.230 --> 06:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:58.070 --> 06:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
and to date
 
06:34:00.868 --> 06:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
as you heard from mr brannan
 
06:34:02.468 --> 06:34:02.478 align:start position:0%
no information
 
06:34:04.628 --> 06:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
regarding those settlement agreements
 
06:34:06.830 --> 06:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
has been made public
 
06:34:09.190 --> 06:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
um all we know is that there was a
 
06:34:10.948 --> 06:34:10.958 align:start position:0%
potential finding
 
06:34:14.468 --> 06:34:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:16.708 --> 06:34:16.718 align:start position:0%
they are supposed to provide information
 
06:34:18.868 --> 06:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
but in no way
 
06:34:21.030 --> 06:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
know whether there has been compliance
 
06:34:23.270 --> 06:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
or if there is compliance with the
 
06:34:28.548 --> 06:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:28.558 --> 06:34:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:34:29.430 --> 06:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:34:31.190 --> 06:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know i think you've also heard today
 
06:34:32.788 --> 06:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
that it it's well known that new
 
06:34:32.798 --> 06:34:34.548 align:start position:0%
that it it's well known that new
hampshire

06:34:34.548 --> 06:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:34:37.110 --> 06:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
is in the middle of a mental health and
 
06:34:40.150 --> 06:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder crisis
 
06:34:42.708 --> 06:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
part of this is due to
 
06:34:45.190 --> 06:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
the shortage of providers
 
06:34:45.200 --> 06:34:46.390 align:start position:0%
the shortage of providers
within

06:34:46.390 --> 06:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
within
 
06:34:47.990 --> 06:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
the mental health and substance use
 
06:34:50.150 --> 06:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
disorder communities that are providing
 
06:34:50.160 --> 06:34:51.430 align:start position:0%
disorder communities that are providing
services

06:34:51.430 --> 06:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:34:53.190 --> 06:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
for folks
 
06:34:56.230 --> 06:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
in further compounding the issue
 
06:34:58.548 --> 06:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
is the number of mental health providers
 
06:35:01.670 --> 06:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
who have opted not to accept
 
06:35:07.110 --> 06:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:09.350 --> 06:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
and part of that is due to lower
 
06:35:11.190 --> 06:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates
 
06:35:13.270 --> 06:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
and also
 
06:35:15.750 --> 06:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
the the complications with the billing
 
06:35:19.830 --> 06:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
and another issue that nami new
 
06:35:25.030 --> 06:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire is very familiar with
 
06:35:27.270 --> 06:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
is something that
 
06:35:30.708 --> 06:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
we describe as ghost networks
 
06:35:33.430 --> 06:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
and what these are is if you look at the
 
06:35:33.440 --> 06:35:34.788 align:start position:0%
and what these are is if you look at the
networks

06:35:34.788 --> 06:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
networks
 
06:35:39.110 --> 06:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
of providers that the insurers have
 
06:35:42.150 --> 06:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's a large list of names
 
06:35:44.390 --> 06:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
but the families
 
06:35:46.230 --> 06:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
that nami new hampshire works with and
 
06:35:46.240 --> 06:35:47.590 align:start position:0%
that nami new hampshire works with and
supports

06:35:47.590 --> 06:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
supports
 
06:35:49.430 --> 06:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
have found that as they start calling
 
06:35:52.070 --> 06:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
down that list that the insurers give
 
06:35:52.080 --> 06:35:53.430 align:start position:0%
down that list that the insurers give
them

06:35:53.430 --> 06:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:35:55.190 --> 06:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
there are no therapists that are
 
06:35:55.200 --> 06:35:57.430 align:start position:0%
there are no therapists that are
accepting

06:35:57.430 --> 06:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
accepting
 
06:35:59.430 --> 06:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
any new patients
 
06:36:01.830 --> 06:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
so if nobody's accepting any new
 
06:36:01.840 --> 06:36:03.110 align:start position:0%
so if nobody's accepting any new
patients

06:36:03.110 --> 06:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
patients
 
06:36:05.750 --> 06:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
not only are there not adequate networks
 
06:36:08.868 --> 06:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
there's no networks at all um
 
06:36:12.070 --> 06:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
and because they are able to produce the
 
06:36:13.830 --> 06:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
names of individuals that they have
 
06:36:15.750 --> 06:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
contracts with
 
06:36:17.670 --> 06:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't know i don't think
 
06:36:19.110 --> 06:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
that the
 
06:36:23.190 --> 06:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
insurers are aware of
 
06:36:25.270 --> 06:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that the providers don't have
 
06:36:27.830 --> 06:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
the the ability to take new patients i
 
06:36:29.510 --> 06:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't think they're doing it nefariously
 
06:36:31.670 --> 06:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's they've got contracts with
 
06:36:34.628 --> 06:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
these providers um they submit those
 
06:36:36.230 --> 06:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
lists to the department it looks like
 
06:36:37.910 --> 06:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's an adequate network everybody
 
06:36:39.510 --> 06:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
thinks there's an adequate network and
 
06:36:42.548 --> 06:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
it's not an adequate network um and it
 
06:36:44.868 --> 06:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
and it really flies under the uh the the
 
06:36:48.948 --> 06:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
radar um and people are not able to
 
06:36:52.548 --> 06:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
receive the services that they need
 
06:36:56.150 --> 06:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that goes back to provider
 
06:36:56.160 --> 06:36:58.070 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that goes back to provider
reimbursements

06:36:58.070 --> 06:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursements
 
06:37:00.868 --> 06:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
because fewer and fewer
 
06:37:02.628 --> 06:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
mental health providers and substance
 
06:37:05.430 --> 06:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
use disorder providers are contracting
 
06:37:08.948 --> 06:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:10.628 --> 06:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
and so house bill
 
06:37:10.638 --> 06:37:12.468 align:start position:0%
and so house bill
1622

06:37:12.468 --> 06:37:12.478 align:start position:0%
1622
 
06:37:12.478 --> 06:37:13.270 align:start position:0%
1622
would

06:37:13.270 --> 06:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:37:15.750 --> 06:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
address reimbursements directly would
 
06:37:18.310 --> 06:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
address the access
 
06:37:20.548 --> 06:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
issues indirectly
 
06:37:23.190 --> 06:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
because if you're able to increase
 
06:37:26.708 --> 06:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement rates for providers
 
06:37:29.350 --> 06:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
then more providers would
 
06:37:31.270 --> 06:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
take commercial insurance
 
06:37:38.468 --> 06:37:38.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:40.548 --> 06:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
and it also does establish the complaint
 
06:37:44.150 --> 06:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
process for providers and for
 
06:37:47.990 --> 06:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:51.190 --> 06:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
which would be separate and apart from
 
06:37:52.390 --> 06:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
the regular
 
06:37:54.070 --> 06:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
complaint process that the insurance
 
06:37:56.070 --> 06:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
department has right now
 
06:37:58.310 --> 06:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
so it would ensure that these
 
06:37:58.320 --> 06:37:59.910 align:start position:0%
so it would ensure that these
complaints

06:37:59.910 --> 06:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
06:38:02.150 --> 06:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
could receive priority they could be
 
06:38:03.590 --> 06:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
parsed out
 
06:38:05.510 --> 06:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
and it would also allow the insurance
 
06:38:07.510 --> 06:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
department to see
 
06:38:09.430 --> 06:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
if a lot of complaints were coming in
 
06:38:12.230 --> 06:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
for a particular
 
06:38:14.310 --> 06:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier
 
06:38:16.788 --> 06:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
so it would make the the job easier for
 
06:38:20.230 --> 06:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
the insurance department
 
06:38:22.628 --> 06:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
so you know because of that i think it's
 
06:38:24.468 --> 06:38:24.478 align:start position:0%
really important to to give strong
 
06:38:26.788 --> 06:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
consideration to this bill and i don't
 
06:38:29.030 --> 06:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
normally do this but i'm i'm going to
 
06:38:29.040 --> 06:38:30.230 align:start position:0%
normally do this but i'm i'm going to
today

06:38:30.230 --> 06:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:38:32.070 --> 06:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
when i moved from
 
06:38:35.270 --> 06:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
new futures to nami new hampshire my
 
06:38:38.708 --> 06:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
insurance switched from harvard pilgrim
 
06:38:41.110 --> 06:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
to anthem
 
06:38:44.548 --> 06:38:44.558 align:start position:0%
i told my therapist that and she said
 
06:38:45.670 --> 06:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
guess what
 
06:38:49.590 --> 06:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not renewing my contract with anthem
 
06:38:52.310 --> 06:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
their reimbursement rates are too low
 
06:38:55.510 --> 06:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
they don't respond to emails and
 
06:38:55.520 --> 06:38:57.270 align:start position:0%
they don't respond to emails and
sorry

06:38:57.270 --> 06:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:38:59.670 --> 06:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know what to tell you so
 
06:39:03.430 --> 06:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
my provider of five years
 
06:39:05.910 --> 06:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
i no longer have because
 
06:39:07.670 --> 06:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
of reimbursement rates
 
06:39:09.750 --> 06:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
and so if people don't think that this
 
06:39:12.310 --> 06:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
is an issue it is an issue
 
06:39:14.310 --> 06:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's a legitimate issue and it's not
 
06:39:16.948 --> 06:39:16.958 align:start position:0%
something that you know
 
06:39:18.310 --> 06:39:18.320 align:start position:0%

06:41:06.390 --> 06:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
i waited 42 years to find him
 
06:41:09.110 --> 06:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
he waited 52 years to find me
 
06:41:11.510 --> 06:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
we shared almost two years
 
06:41:13.190 --> 06:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
of what we had thought would be the rest
 
06:41:14.628 --> 06:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
of our lives
 
06:41:16.788 --> 06:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
and we were happy
 
06:41:18.548 --> 06:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
we met when we were both three years
 
06:41:20.310 --> 06:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
clean and sober
 
06:41:22.070 --> 06:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
he wowed me from our very first
 
06:41:24.468 --> 06:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
conversation when he told me he ran
 
06:41:26.948 --> 06:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
sober houses and that he had run for and
 
06:41:26.958 --> 06:41:27.830 align:start position:0%
sober houses and that he had run for and
won

06:41:27.830 --> 06:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
won
 
06:41:30.150 --> 06:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
a seat in the new hampshire house on a
 
06:41:32.708 --> 06:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
platform of addiction and recovery his
 
06:41:35.990 --> 06:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
authenticity his transparency his huge
 
06:41:37.670 --> 06:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
heart of service
 
06:41:40.708 --> 06:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
won me from the start
 
06:41:42.788 --> 06:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
his time in the new hampshire house and
 
06:41:45.670 --> 06:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
his subsequent run for senate he lost in
 
06:41:49.350 --> 06:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
2020 to harold french who's a great guy
 
06:41:51.350 --> 06:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
was all about being of service
 
06:41:53.110 --> 06:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
phil was particularly passionate about
 
06:41:54.788 --> 06:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
the issues of addiction and mental
 
06:41:57.030 --> 06:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
health he would have earnestly supported
 
06:41:59.990 --> 06:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and the people it protects
 
06:42:01.910 --> 06:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
he was ceaselessly courageous about
 
06:42:03.430 --> 06:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
sharing his own history with those
 
06:42:07.030 --> 06:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
challenges his decades of alcohol and
 
06:42:08.310 --> 06:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
drug use
 
06:42:10.868 --> 06:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
his depression and in particular his
 
06:42:13.190 --> 06:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
anxiety which was a crippling force
 
06:42:15.190 --> 06:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
throughout his life
 
06:42:17.590 --> 06:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
what i didn't know until it was too late
 
06:42:20.150 --> 06:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
was that even during those five years of
 
06:42:22.468 --> 06:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
living sober and being a wholehearted
 
06:42:25.110 --> 06:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
public servant and activist
 
06:42:26.628 --> 06:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
phil's mental health was never really
 
06:42:26.638 --> 06:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
phil's mental health was never really
managed

06:42:27.750 --> 06:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
managed
 
06:42:29.670 --> 06:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of this past may he was
 
06:42:31.670 --> 06:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer
 
06:42:33.590 --> 06:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
and he panicked
 
06:42:35.270 --> 06:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
a few days later in the beginning of
 
06:42:38.390 --> 06:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
june he relapsed and three weeks later
 
06:42:40.948 --> 06:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
on the night of summer solstice he died
 
06:42:44.230 --> 06:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
in a drug den in manchester
 
06:42:46.468 --> 06:42:46.478 align:start position:0%
during those last three weeks he and i
 
06:42:48.788 --> 06:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
had some heavy conversations and that's
 
06:42:50.548 --> 06:42:50.558 align:start position:0%
when he told me his meds had stopped
 
06:42:52.310 --> 06:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
working long ago he'd been
 
06:42:54.230 --> 06:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
white-knuckling his mental health for a
 
06:42:55.590 --> 06:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
long time
 
06:42:57.430 --> 06:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
this man's entire life was about
 
06:43:00.468 --> 06:43:00.478 align:start position:0%
recovery he lived and breathed sobriety
 
06:43:04.150 --> 06:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
mental health awareness destigmatization
 
06:43:05.830 --> 06:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
but he was much better at advocating for
 
06:43:08.390 --> 06:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
others than for himself
 
06:43:10.150 --> 06:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
when he realized long-term sobriety
 
06:43:11.910 --> 06:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
still hadn't addressed his mental health
 
06:43:11.920 --> 06:43:12.788 align:start position:0%
still hadn't addressed his mental health
needs

06:43:12.788 --> 06:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
needs
 
06:43:15.030 --> 06:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
he toughed it out in silence
 
06:43:16.948 --> 06:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
by the time he finally told me he wasn't
 
06:43:19.110 --> 06:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay it was too late
 
06:43:21.030 --> 06:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
we got him in to see a new psychiatrist
 
06:43:23.110 --> 06:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
but with his anxiety off the charts over
 
06:43:25.670 --> 06:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
the cancer he ended up doing what we
 
06:43:27.110 --> 06:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
addicts do
 
06:43:28.868 --> 06:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
and he self-medicated
 
06:43:30.628 --> 06:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
and long before his new meds had a
 
06:43:33.990 --> 06:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
chance to kick in he was dead
 
06:43:35.910 --> 06:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear there's only one
 
06:43:38.548 --> 06:43:38.558 align:start position:0%
person whose responsibility it was to
 
06:43:41.590 --> 06:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
keep phil alive and that was phil
 
06:43:43.990 --> 06:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
he was an expert he knew what to do he
 
06:43:46.230 --> 06:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
knew he needed to ask for help and he
 
06:43:48.708 --> 06:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
waited way too long
 
06:43:50.788 --> 06:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
but part of the reason he waited was
 
06:43:52.628 --> 06:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
that he didn't believe help would be
 
06:43:55.430 --> 06:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
there if he asked
 
06:43:57.590 --> 06:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
when phil got sober at 48 he went on
 
06:43:59.750 --> 06:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid for the first time in his life
 
06:44:01.270 --> 06:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
but when he called to get an appointment
 
06:44:02.868 --> 06:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
with a mental health professional he
 
06:44:04.468 --> 06:44:04.478 align:start position:0%
couldn't find anyone accepting new
 
06:44:06.708 --> 06:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
clients who took medicaid when he called
 
06:44:08.468 --> 06:44:08.478 align:start position:0%
to see if he could get in a rehab for
 
06:44:10.468 --> 06:44:10.478 align:start position:0%
the time being he was told the wait time
 
06:44:13.270 --> 06:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
for a bed was six to eight weeks
 
06:44:16.230 --> 06:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
he said i'll be out by then i'll be dead
 
06:44:18.070 --> 06:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
he ended up going to the laconia mayor's
 
06:44:20.468 --> 06:44:20.478 align:start position:0%
office and asking for an appointment
 
06:44:22.708 --> 06:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
and when he got one he asked the mayor
 
06:44:24.788 --> 06:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
how does a guy like me stay sober in
 
06:44:26.230 --> 06:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
this town
 
06:44:28.230 --> 06:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
the mayor told him
 
06:44:30.070 --> 06:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
06:44:31.830 --> 06:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem
 
06:44:34.628 --> 06:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
people want help they qualify for help
 
06:44:36.868 --> 06:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
they even ask for help and they can't
 
06:44:38.390 --> 06:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
access help
 
06:44:40.230 --> 06:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
help isn't available
 
06:44:43.350 --> 06:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
help will take too long
 
06:44:45.670 --> 06:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
that mayor may have saved phil's life
 
06:44:47.350 --> 06:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
that day by putting him in touch with
 
06:44:49.190 --> 06:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
some people who were starting a recovery
 
06:44:49.200 --> 06:44:50.708 align:start position:0%
some people who were starting a recovery
center

06:44:50.708 --> 06:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
center
 
06:44:52.708 --> 06:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
phil got involved and he found a
 
06:44:54.868 --> 06:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
lifeline to hold on to
 
06:44:54.878 --> 06:44:56.230 align:start position:0%
lifeline to hold on to
service

06:44:56.230 --> 06:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:44:58.230 --> 06:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
a few years later during a tv appearance
 
06:44:59.750 --> 06:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
he said
 
06:45:01.270 --> 06:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i'd still be sitting
 
06:45:03.350 --> 06:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
here today sober if i wasn't given the
 
06:45:05.590 --> 06:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help others
 
06:45:07.510 --> 06:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
if we don't help the ones who are still
 
06:45:09.750 --> 06:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
suffering who's going to
 
06:45:12.390 --> 06:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
if not me then who
 
06:45:14.230 --> 06:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's the question i ask myself all the
 
06:45:14.240 --> 06:45:16.070 align:start position:0%
that's the question i ask myself all the
time

06:45:16.070 --> 06:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:45:18.070 --> 06:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
and he did ask himself that question all
 
06:45:20.548 --> 06:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
the time i saw it
 
06:45:22.788 --> 06:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
and still it ended the worst possible
 
06:45:25.190 --> 06:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
way for him
 
06:45:28.788 --> 06:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
i have been angry at him for this
 
06:45:31.190 --> 06:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
it was such a stupid way for such a
 
06:45:34.708 --> 06:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
smart man to die
 
06:45:36.868 --> 06:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
but i made my guy a promise
 
06:45:38.390 --> 06:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
after he died
 
06:45:40.310 --> 06:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
that i would remember him for his
 
06:45:40.320 --> 06:45:41.670 align:start position:0%
that i would remember him for his
greatness

06:45:41.670 --> 06:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
greatness
 
06:45:43.510 --> 06:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i do
 
06:45:46.868 --> 06:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
his transparency his advocacy his
 
06:45:49.750 --> 06:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
dedication to serving others
 
06:45:52.310 --> 06:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
what a courageous way
 
06:45:56.788 --> 06:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:59.910 --> 06:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
phil was literally one of you
 
06:46:01.510 --> 06:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
although he sat on the health and human
 
06:46:03.990 --> 06:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
services committee
 
06:46:06.868 --> 06:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
mental illness and addiction
 
06:46:08.868 --> 06:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
look like this
 
06:46:10.150 --> 06:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
like phil
 
06:46:11.270 --> 06:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
good people
 
06:46:12.868 --> 06:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
living good lives
 
06:46:14.390 --> 06:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
doing their best
 
06:46:18.150 --> 06:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
helping others learning to ask for help
 
06:46:19.750 --> 06:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
and needing to know
 
06:46:21.430 --> 06:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
that help will be available when they
 
06:46:24.628 --> 06:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:26.468 --> 06:46:26.478 align:start position:0%
mental illness and addiction when the
 
06:46:29.350 --> 06:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
help people need isn't available to them
 
06:46:31.990 --> 06:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
looks like me the widow for no good
 
06:46:32.000 --> 06:46:33.110 align:start position:0%
looks like me the widow for no good
reason

06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
reason
 
06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
grieving every day not just the death of
 
06:46:36.230 --> 06:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
the man
 
06:46:38.628 --> 06:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
i wanted to spend my life with but the
 
06:46:40.788 --> 06:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
terrible truth that his death was
 
06:46:40.798 --> 06:46:43.590 align:start position:0%
terrible truth that his death was
preventable

06:46:43.590 --> 06:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:45.830 --> 06:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's too late to save his life
 
06:46:47.910 --> 06:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
but not to save others
 
06:46:50.230 --> 06:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
one thing i know for sure
 
06:46:52.868 --> 06:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
my guy whose entire life was about
 
06:46:54.390 --> 06:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
service to others
 
06:46:56.830 --> 06:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
would want his death to be of service
 
06:47:00.788 --> 06:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
too phil's life demonstrated the value
 
06:47:03.750 --> 06:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
of legislation like this bill
 
06:47:09.190 --> 06:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:10.868 --> 06:47:10.878 align:start position:0%

a minute and say thank you
 
06:47:51.910 --> 06:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
because it takes a lot a lot of courage
 
06:47:54.230 --> 06:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
to come in and speak in front of us not
 
06:47:56.390 --> 06:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
just in front of us but we have a lot of
 
06:47:56.400 --> 06:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
just in front of us but we have a lot of
people

06:47:57.510 --> 06:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:47:59.270 --> 06:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
listen and
 
06:48:02.070 --> 06:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
see in this video
 
06:48:04.150 --> 06:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
mental illness
 
06:48:07.270 --> 06:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
is not an easy topic to speak about it
 
06:48:09.270 --> 06:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
let me tell you i come from a culture
 
06:48:12.390 --> 06:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
that mental illness is a taboo we're not
 
06:48:14.230 --> 06:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak about it
 
06:48:16.548 --> 06:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
and then a lot of times we don't get the
 
06:48:18.628 --> 06:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
help that we need
 
06:48:21.270 --> 06:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
but you strain and
 
06:48:23.510 --> 06:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
the way you're speaking and i know that
 
06:48:25.590 --> 06:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
he touched a lot of lies because
 
06:48:27.350 --> 06:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
i have friends who live in laconia and
 
06:48:29.670 --> 06:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
they know him and i know a lot of people
 
06:48:32.868 --> 06:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
they've been touched by him
 
06:48:35.110 --> 06:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
i'm so grateful you're here
 
06:48:37.190 --> 06:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm so grateful for everything he
 
06:48:39.430 --> 06:48:39.440 align:start position:0%

did and then you're speaking in front of
us

doing what i'm doing
 
06:48:46.468 --> 06:48:46.478 align:start position:0%

06:48:49.590 --> 06:48:49.600 align:start position:0%

06:51:03.590 --> 06:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
company serving the individual and group
 
06:51:06.310 --> 06:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
markets and the only insurance company
 
06:51:08.788 --> 06:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
founded by doctors
 
06:51:10.468 --> 06:51:10.478 align:start position:0%
while we've signed in in opposition to
 
06:51:13.670 --> 06:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
h.b 1622 we fully understand how vitally
 
06:51:15.670 --> 06:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
important mental health care is its
 
06:51:16.948 --> 06:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
importance has been highlighted
 
06:51:18.708 --> 06:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
particularly through the coven 19
 
06:51:18.718 --> 06:51:19.990 align:start position:0%
particularly through the coven 19
pandemic

06:51:19.990 --> 06:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
06:51:21.990 --> 06:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
the concerns we have with the bill are
 
06:51:23.350 --> 06:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
that its goals appear to be already
 
06:51:25.430 --> 06:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
addressed in other parts of statute
 
06:51:27.750 --> 06:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
therefore the bill is unnecessary
 
06:51:29.430 --> 06:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
for instance section one of the bill
 
06:51:31.030 --> 06:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
gives the insurance department the
 
06:51:32.788 --> 06:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
authority to investigate insurance
 
06:51:35.030 --> 06:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
carrier conduct that may violate the
 
06:51:37.590 --> 06:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
federal mental health parity law
 
06:51:39.430 --> 06:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
also known as the
 
06:51:40.868 --> 06:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
mental health parity and addiction
 
06:51:43.190 --> 06:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
equity enforcement law
 
06:51:45.590 --> 06:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
which has been a tongue twister earlier
 
06:51:47.750 --> 06:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the day as well
 
06:51:48.868 --> 06:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
so the bill gives authority to
 
06:51:50.868 --> 06:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
investigate conduct that may violate
 
06:51:53.110 --> 06:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
that however has been mentioned by
 
06:51:55.030 --> 06:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
tyler brennan amongst others that the
 
06:51:56.628 --> 06:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
insurance department already has
 
06:51:58.390 --> 06:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
investigational authority under
 
06:51:58.400 --> 06:52:00.230 align:start position:0%
investigational authority under
rsa400a16

06:52:00.230 --> 06:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
rsa400a16
 
06:52:01.670 --> 06:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
which states the insurance department
 
06:52:04.070 --> 06:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
quote may conduct such investigations in
 
06:52:05.670 --> 06:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
addition to those specifically provided
 
06:52:05.680 --> 06:52:06.628 align:start position:0%
addition to those specifically provided
for

06:52:06.628 --> 06:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:52:09.030 --> 06:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
as maybe found necessary in order to
 
06:52:10.548 --> 06:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
promote efficient administration of the
 
06:52:10.558 --> 06:52:11.990 align:start position:0%
promote efficient administration of the
provisions

06:52:11.990 --> 06:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
06:52:13.910 --> 06:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
the insurance department has examination
 
06:52:17.190 --> 06:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
authority under rsa 4837 and they
 
06:52:19.110 --> 06:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
recently committed completed as was
 
06:52:21.670 --> 06:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned a market conduct exam of three
 
06:52:23.030 --> 06:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's commercial carriers
 
06:52:25.750 --> 06:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure compliance with the federal
 
06:52:27.510 --> 06:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
06:52:29.190 --> 06:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
section one further requires that the
 
06:52:30.708 --> 06:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
insurance department establish a
 
06:52:33.270 --> 06:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
specific mental health complaint process
 
06:52:34.868 --> 06:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
as has been mentioned the insurance
 
06:52:36.628 --> 06:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
department already has a complaint
 
06:52:38.548 --> 06:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
process which is managed by the consumer
 
06:52:40.868 --> 06:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
services division a separate complaint
 
06:52:42.628 --> 06:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
process specifically for mental health
 
06:52:44.310 --> 06:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
parity is unnecessary it would be
 
06:52:46.708 --> 06:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
confusing to the consumer
 
06:52:48.548 --> 06:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
section one would also require insurers
 
06:52:50.150 --> 06:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
to submit annual reports on their
 
06:52:52.070 --> 06:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with the federal law
 
06:52:54.468 --> 06:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
the recent federal amendments to the law
 
06:52:57.110 --> 06:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
require plans to do an analysis of all
 
06:52:59.030 --> 06:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
non-quantitative treatment limitations
 
06:53:01.350 --> 06:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate compliance with that and
 
06:53:03.030 --> 06:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
as tyler mentioned there's a bill in the
 
06:53:05.190 --> 06:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
senate i think it's senate bill 373 or
 
06:53:08.070 --> 06:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
343 373
 
06:53:10.310 --> 06:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
that basically uh make some changes in
 
06:53:12.468 --> 06:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
the state insurance laws to allow those
 
06:53:14.230 --> 06:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
same reports to be submitted to the new
 
06:53:16.390 --> 06:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire insurance department we should
 
06:53:17.910 --> 06:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
be striving to align the federal
 
06:53:20.070 --> 06:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
requirements rather than create new
 
06:53:22.468 --> 06:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
requirements i just note that the
 
06:53:24.230 --> 06:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
insurance department has filed this bill
 
06:53:25.510 --> 06:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
06:53:27.190 --> 06:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that and finally the
 
06:53:28.628 --> 06:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
bill would require reimbursement rates
 
06:53:30.230 --> 06:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
for behavioral health care to be no less
 
06:53:31.830 --> 06:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
extensive than rates provided for other
 
06:53:33.190 --> 06:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
type of health care
 
06:53:34.708 --> 06:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
the federal law already addresses how
 
06:53:36.310 --> 06:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers should be addressing
 
06:53:38.150 --> 06:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates and we should not be
 
06:53:39.670 --> 06:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
reinterpreting the law through the state
 
06:53:39.680 --> 06:53:41.030 align:start position:0%
reinterpreting the law through the state
statute

06:53:41.030 --> 06:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:53:41.040 --> 06:53:42.628 align:start position:0%
statute
so

06:53:42.628 --> 06:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:53:44.708 --> 06:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
one final note is the legislature uh
 
06:53:47.510 --> 06:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
revisited the issue in 2020 has has been
 
06:53:49.910 --> 06:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned already an added language that
 
06:53:51.750 --> 06:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
requires insurers to include in their
 
06:53:53.910 --> 06:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
contracts with participating providers
 
06:53:55.750 --> 06:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement terms for mental health
 
06:53:58.150 --> 06:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
and substance use treatment that are on
 
06:53:59.910 --> 06:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
average at least as favorable as those
 
06:54:01.350 --> 06:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
in their contracts for professional
 
06:54:03.230 --> 06:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
services uh provided by
 
06:54:05.670 --> 06:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
non-hospital-affiliated pcps
 
06:54:07.270 --> 06:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
this section of the law has only been in
 
06:54:09.350 --> 06:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
effect for about 18 months so overall we
 
06:54:11.350 --> 06:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
feel that the provisions in this
 
06:54:14.150 --> 06:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill before you are already covered
 
06:54:15.430 --> 06:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the insurance department has the
 
06:54:16.868 --> 06:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
authority to do the things already
 
06:54:19.270 --> 06:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned in here and adding yet another
 
06:54:22.150 --> 06:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
layer of it will not prove helpful or
 
06:54:24.070 --> 06:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
change anything be happy to take any
 
06:54:24.080 --> 06:54:26.948 align:start position:0%
change anything be happy to take any
questions

06:54:26.948 --> 06:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:54:28.788 --> 06:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
06:54:29.990 --> 06:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you sir
 
06:54:32.390 --> 06:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
for answering our questions
 
06:54:34.868 --> 06:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot that reimbursement
 
06:54:37.910 --> 06:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
rates are too low that's been testimony
 
06:54:41.030 --> 06:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
from several people that they're too low
 
06:54:43.510 --> 06:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
so how are reimbursement rates
 
06:54:43.520 --> 06:54:45.110 align:start position:0%
so how are reimbursement rates
determined

06:54:45.110 --> 06:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
determined
 
06:54:47.430 --> 06:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
i am not sure internally how it all
 
06:54:49.830 --> 06:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
works i know that's under the purview of
 
06:54:49.840 --> 06:54:51.510 align:start position:0%
works i know that's under the purview of
the

06:54:51.510 --> 06:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:54:53.350 --> 06:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
insurance department's review of the
 
06:54:54.868 --> 06:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
06:54:56.708 --> 06:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
provisions of the plans that the market
 
06:54:59.270 --> 06:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
conducts study that apparently from what
 
06:55:01.110 --> 06:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
tyler has said we'll be able to talk a
 
06:55:03.670 --> 06:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
lot a bit more in a couple of weeks
 
06:55:06.150 --> 06:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
so the federal law certainly dictates
 
06:55:08.628 --> 06:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
the process by which rates are set uh
 
06:55:10.468 --> 06:55:10.478 align:start position:0%
but i do not know internally how the
 
06:55:11.990 --> 06:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
process actually happens i mean there's
 
06:55:14.150 --> 06:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's contract negotiations obviously
 
06:55:17.110 --> 06:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
with carriers and i do know that um you
 
06:55:19.510 --> 06:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of
 
06:55:21.270 --> 06:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
leverage let's say that providers that
 
06:55:23.590 --> 06:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
work for large hospital groups have
 
06:55:25.510 --> 06:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
because network adequacy is required
 
06:55:26.788 --> 06:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
06:55:29.190 --> 06:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
over an independent provider it forces
 
06:55:30.788 --> 06:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
that work as well outside of the
 
06:55:34.310 --> 06:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:36.708 --> 06:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
representative terry
 
06:55:37.830 --> 06:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you for your
 
06:55:40.070 --> 06:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
i receive a lot of uh
 
06:55:44.230 --> 06:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
email with um
 
06:55:46.868 --> 06:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
copies of uh testimony
 
06:55:49.110 --> 06:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
if you've already done so i apologize i
 
06:55:51.990 --> 06:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
will check my email when i return home
 
06:55:54.070 --> 06:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
if you have not done so would you be so
 
06:55:56.788 --> 06:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
kind as to submit your written testimony
 
06:55:58.230 --> 06:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
to the members of the committee yes
 
06:55:59.510 --> 06:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and i will do that i have not
 
06:56:01.590 --> 06:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
yet done that
 
06:56:01.600 --> 06:56:03.110 align:start position:0%
yet done that
so

06:56:03.110 --> 06:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:56:05.110 --> 06:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
is harvard pilgrim and the granite
 
06:56:05.120 --> 06:56:07.270 align:start position:0%
is harvard pilgrim and the granite
advantage

06:56:07.270 --> 06:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
06:56:10.230 --> 06:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
no that's the medicaid expansion
 
06:56:12.628 --> 06:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
there's just three companies and
 
06:56:13.910 --> 06:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah the managed care companies i
 
06:56:16.708 --> 06:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
believe right right
 
06:56:17.910 --> 06:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
i thought there was supposed to be a
 
06:56:20.070 --> 06:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
non-profit they had to get a non-profit
 
06:56:22.070 --> 06:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
into that there may be in that uh but i
 
06:56:24.868 --> 06:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
in terms of the individual and um group
 
06:56:26.310 --> 06:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
health insurance markets i believe we're
 
06:56:27.830 --> 06:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
the only non-profit that covers all of
 
06:56:30.230 --> 06:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
them right right
 
06:56:33.190 --> 06:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
and of course medicare
 
06:56:35.910 --> 06:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:35.920 --> 06:56:36.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:56:36.788 --> 06:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:56:38.150 --> 06:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
seeing on thank you very much thank you
 
06:56:39.030 --> 06:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
very much
 
06:56:58.150 --> 06:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:01.190 --> 06:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:02.868 --> 06:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
06:57:04.230 --> 06:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee um for the record my
 
06:57:06.070 --> 06:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
name is heidi kroll i work at gallagher
 
06:57:08.788 --> 06:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
callahan gartrell and i represent ahip
 
06:57:10.230 --> 06:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
which is america's health insurance
 
06:57:12.070 --> 06:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
plans um
 
06:57:13.830 --> 06:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
at this point everything i had in my
 
06:57:16.150 --> 06:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
notes to say i think has been said and
 
06:57:18.230 --> 06:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
so i i won't um
 
06:57:19.830 --> 06:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
repeat what other speakers have said
 
06:57:22.868 --> 06:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
ahip does have some you know significant
 
06:57:24.948 --> 06:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill um for the
 
06:57:26.548 --> 06:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
reasons um
 
06:57:27.830 --> 06:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
that have been expressed i think by
 
06:57:30.548 --> 06:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
anthem and harvard pilgrim um just i
 
06:57:33.510 --> 06:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
think in general concerns about um
 
06:57:36.628 --> 06:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
duplication with what already exists in
 
06:57:39.270 --> 06:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
federal and state law
 
06:57:41.270 --> 06:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
and with duplication and trying to
 
06:57:44.230 --> 06:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
reinterpret comes potential unintended
 
06:57:45.910 --> 06:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
consequences that i think we just want
 
06:57:48.230 --> 06:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
to be really careful about
 
06:57:50.150 --> 06:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
as you've heard there's a lot of history
 
06:57:52.310 --> 06:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
and there's also it's a very complicated
 
06:57:53.830 --> 06:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
subject matter
 
06:57:55.670 --> 06:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
and we have had recent legislation as
 
06:57:58.548 --> 06:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
you heard in 2019 we had
 
06:58:00.788 --> 06:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
senator morgan's bill sb
 
06:58:04.070 --> 06:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
272 and in 2020 we had senator sherman's
 
06:58:07.270 --> 06:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
bill which started out as sb 620 was
 
06:58:11.750 --> 06:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately rolled into house bill 1639
 
06:58:11.760 --> 06:58:12.868 align:start position:0%
ultimately rolled into house bill 1639
that

06:58:12.868 --> 06:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:58:14.788 --> 06:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
addressed mental health parity under the
 
06:58:17.670 --> 06:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
insurance laws uh and in both bills made
 
06:58:19.910 --> 06:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
changes to certain sections of
 
06:58:19.920 --> 06:58:21.468 align:start position:0%
changes to certain sections of
rsa

06:58:21.468 --> 06:58:21.478 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
06:58:25.670 --> 06:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
417-e colon one which is um in your
 
06:58:27.430 --> 06:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill you're looking at
 
06:58:27.440 --> 06:58:28.468 align:start position:0%
in the bill you're looking at
um

06:58:28.468 --> 06:58:28.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:30.948 --> 06:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
and so that section of law now contains
 
06:58:33.590 --> 06:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
language about reimbursement standards
 
06:58:35.190 --> 06:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
for mental health and substance use
 
06:58:37.110 --> 06:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
disorders and ms rogers was speaking
 
06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
about this and i think from ahib's
 
06:58:41.590 --> 06:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
perspective we're concerned that
 
06:58:43.670 --> 06:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
really it's anything more than what we
 
06:58:45.830 --> 06:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
have in current law relative to
 
06:58:47.590 --> 06:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement standards
 
06:58:49.590 --> 06:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh could be starting down a slippery
 
06:58:51.910 --> 06:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
slope of putting us in a territory of
 
06:58:54.150 --> 06:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
actually rate setting and price fixing
 
06:58:55.990 --> 06:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
which i think we just want to be really
 
06:58:56.000 --> 06:58:56.948 align:start position:0%
which i think we just want to be really
careful

06:58:56.948 --> 06:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
careful
 
06:58:59.830 --> 06:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
about that um all of the other points
 
06:59:01.430 --> 06:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
that i was going to make have been said
 
06:59:03.110 --> 06:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
so i will respect your time and not
 
06:59:04.390 --> 06:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
repeat them
 
06:59:06.070 --> 06:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
i just did want to respond to one
 
06:59:08.468 --> 06:59:08.478 align:start position:0%
question um that representative abel had
 
06:59:11.670 --> 06:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
about new language and um i just wanted
 
06:59:15.270 --> 06:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
to point out that um all of page one in
 
06:59:16.310 --> 06:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:59:20.230 --> 06:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
um on to page two up to line eight that
 
06:59:22.310 --> 06:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
is all new it's just not appearing in
 
06:59:25.270 --> 06:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
bold because because all of it is new um
 
06:59:28.070 --> 06:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
and what follows is um
 
06:59:31.190 --> 06:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
existing law that is um proposing you
 
06:59:33.110 --> 06:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
know the proposal to change so that
 
06:59:35.190 --> 06:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's what you see in the bold so
 
06:59:35.200 --> 06:59:36.708 align:start position:0%
that's what you see in the bold so
um

06:59:36.708 --> 06:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:38.708 --> 06:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
i i did see mr chairman that you have
 
06:59:40.628 --> 06:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
scheduled already a work session on this
 
06:59:43.270 --> 06:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
um and i i know that ahip and ahip's
 
06:59:45.430 --> 06:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
members will will be there and available
 
06:59:48.468 --> 06:59:48.478 align:start position:0%
and uh willing to participate um so i
 
06:59:51.670 --> 06:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time very much thank you
 
06:59:53.590 --> 06:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
so before you go
 
06:59:55.350 --> 06:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
06:59:58.150 --> 06:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
and that is an old subject matter that's
 
06:59:59.510 --> 06:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
been around for a while
 
07:00:03.510 --> 07:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it's a network adequacy
 
07:00:06.150 --> 07:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
and terms of how we define adequate and
 
07:00:08.310 --> 07:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
i think i got a letter from dj this week
 
07:00:09.910 --> 07:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
or maybe i got it from
 
07:00:12.230 --> 07:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
nick that said how great we are doing in
 
07:00:14.708 --> 07:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
terms of network adequacy i think there
 
07:00:16.548 --> 07:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
was a letter sent out at least i assume
 
07:00:20.708 --> 07:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:22.548 --> 07:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
and my question is
 
07:00:22.558 --> 07:00:24.548 align:start position:0%
and my question is
if

07:00:24.548 --> 07:00:24.558 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:00:27.270 --> 07:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
companies are listening names in those
 
07:00:28.948 --> 07:00:28.958 align:start position:0%
physicians or those doctors they're not
 
07:00:31.270 --> 07:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
taking new patients
 
07:00:34.150 --> 07:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
in the age of computers now where we do
 
07:00:37.990 --> 07:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:39.750 --> 07:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
how difficult would it be for you to
 
07:00:41.750 --> 07:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
actually make sure that the
 
07:00:44.468 --> 07:00:44.478 align:start position:0%
listing of providers are actually
 
07:00:47.110 --> 07:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
taking patients
 
07:00:48.948 --> 07:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
07:00:51.030 --> 07:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not prepared to answer that at the
 
07:00:52.868 --> 07:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
moment it's just not my area of
 
07:00:55.030 --> 07:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
expertise but
 
07:00:56.548 --> 07:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
i think the carriers in the room have
 
07:00:59.350 --> 07:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
heard the question and and i you know
 
07:01:01.110 --> 07:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
the department here as well and so that
 
07:01:02.788 --> 07:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
might be a question that we can answer
 
07:01:04.948 --> 07:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
at the work session well as the
 
07:01:07.110 --> 07:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
spokesman for all the companies
 
07:01:10.830 --> 07:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
i'm urging you to uh kind of figure out
 
07:01:13.990 --> 07:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
some ways we can solve this issue
 
07:01:16.310 --> 07:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
um in terms of that when someone go you
 
07:01:18.310 --> 07:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
know is looking for a provider
 
07:01:20.628 --> 07:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
um they're not you know running around
 
07:01:22.948 --> 07:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
calling calling calling that that the
 
07:01:25.190 --> 07:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
network got exclusive is really actual
 
07:01:27.190 --> 07:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's no ghost networks we need to
 
07:01:28.788 --> 07:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
have real networks
 
07:01:31.350 --> 07:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
or if they're closed they're closed but
 
07:01:31.360 --> 07:01:32.150 align:start position:0%
or if they're closed they're closed but
then

07:01:32.150 --> 07:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:01:34.548 --> 07:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
then you it begs the question
 
07:01:36.468 --> 07:01:36.478 align:start position:0%
uh whether you need to hire some find
 
07:01:38.070 --> 07:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
some new page
 
07:01:39.670 --> 07:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
physicians who
 
07:01:41.350 --> 07:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll have to pay them more money
 
07:01:43.270 --> 07:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
and that way you guys do it rather than
 
07:01:45.030 --> 07:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
us mandating it
 
07:01:45.040 --> 07:01:46.070 align:start position:0%
us mandating it
understood

07:01:46.070 --> 07:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
understood
 
07:01:47.750 --> 07:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
fair point yes
 
07:01:50.788 --> 07:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you
 
07:01:54.948 --> 07:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
