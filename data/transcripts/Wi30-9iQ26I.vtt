00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh the bulk of the
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
amendment is a study commission um that
 
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
will Begin work next year in
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
2025 um this is building on a bill uh
 
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
that will hopefully pass the house um
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
but passed science yesterday um that
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
would establish a a registry for carbon
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
credits or for Forest carbon credits um
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
the and then it will um ask Dr to study
 
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
the impact on local tax revenues so this
 
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 align:start position:0%
bill would would hope to then take that
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
data as it comes in um next year um in
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
the second half of next year and begin
 
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 align:start position:0%
to analyze that with a group of uh
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
invested stakeholders um the the the
 
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
broad makeup of the commission is
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
similar to the current use board um many
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the members are present are coming
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
from the current use board um although I
 
00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
I um just because of their background um
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
and and um stakeholder status with the
 
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.390 align:start position:0%
and and um stakeholder status with the
issue

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
um the the second part of the amendment
 
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
is what we heard in our um hearing um it
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
is about
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
795 um the section of Timber tax current
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
Timber tax law that says the town May
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
assess a Timber tax on standing Timber
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
um the it is a directive to um Dr to
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
produce rules um on that on that part of
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
the law um I it has been talked about
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned in my testimony the
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
it has never been challenged it has
 
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
never been used before um it is a very
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
old part of the law turned 75 um this
 
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
year uh so
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
the the it could be ruled that that part
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the law is not enforceable and this
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
will allow us to know that as well so
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
and if it is unenforceable we should
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
remove it because it shouldn't be in
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
there um so this is a broadly to take
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
that study commission as part one and
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
then the second part to direct Dr to
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
795 uh we wish to speak to the amendment
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I I want to thank
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly for all the work
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
he's done on this and I'm I'm very happy
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
that we are working that he worked with
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
members of the science technology and
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
energy committee this is an emerging um
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
it's actually it's probably an
 
00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
established industry but um I like the
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
fact that this commission will look at
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
Trends which will help identify
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the state where we can
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
have win-win programs not just for land
 
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
owners the timber industry but also for
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
people seeking carbon credits so I I I
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
you representative veale
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
or I just wanted to quickly add that um
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
on the topic of commissions we talked
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
about this quite a bit and there's a lot
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
of energy behind the subject and we
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
should have no problem with this
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
commission going forward with the multi-
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
amendment okay uh representative BQ
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
represent then representative wolf thank
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank representative Kelly
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
for bringing this up and for answering
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
my questions um by email last night I
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that got a couple of
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions couple of topics on the
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
amendment as I look at it further first
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
is the thinking on the makeup um only
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
two legislative members and only one can
 
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
be from this committee the other has to
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
be from Ways and Means one majority
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
party one minority party and then nine
 
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
and one Senator if they decide to show
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
up uh and then nine public members so my
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
question is what's the thinking behind
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
that and and the other question uh is
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
repealing of
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
793b uh it say it states that that's
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the forest carbon commission
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
but as I read
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
793b it eliminates the ability of a
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
municipality to wave the yield tax why
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
do we want to take that ability away
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
from the towns uh 793b States when
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting is conducted on land
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
owned and located in a municipality
 
00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:42.519 align:start position:0%
municipality May wave the yield tax
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I read 793b so is that an
 
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.990 align:start position:0%
that's what I read 793b so is that an
incorrect

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
site there's nothing no mention of any
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
Commission in
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
793b that's page page two line 23
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
I so I just wonder if that's an
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
incorrect site in the amendment I'm
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly to
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
respond there's already currently a 793b
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
there might be an oversight because 793b
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
is referring to the commission itself
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
that's established in section one uh the
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
way that the uh study commission set up
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
um is that there is a standing part of
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
the law that will repeal the study
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
commission and remove it from the law at
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
a certain time so 793b is the assigned
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
section that OS has given to this this
 
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
bill um on page line nine on page one um
 
00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:31.959 align:start position:0%
um so section the repeal section on
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
sites uh 20 on 23 on page two is
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
referring to this this commission so
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
it'll remove the commission's authority
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
date and the and to refer to the U
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
makeup of the members I I based the
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
membership on the uh for that part on
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
the low grade Timber study commission
 
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
that had done work last year um I I'd be
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
happy to put more legislative members on
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
that commission that's that's not not a
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
concern for mine follow followup um do
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
what do you think about studying it you
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
within this committee I'm generally
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
asking I'm not trying to soft kill the
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill because I think it's a matter
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
worthy of subject of study but the other
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
way we could do it is I know it's a
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
could be potentially a busy summer for a
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
lot of us but what what do you think
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
about genuinely studying it in the
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
interim not you know not s kill to
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
respond um I I guess the the Crux of
 
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is to work with 697 which
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
won't which will take some time to GA
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
gather data on um so the and to allow Dr
 
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
to produce their report um in November
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
so those two things we won't have until
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
late in the session we won't be and this
 
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
will uh just establish that going
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
forward next
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
year representative wolf then
 
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.949 align:start position:0%
year representative wolf then
representative

00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:01.750 align:start position:0%
representative
Darby

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.310 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
um as um representative McHugh said I am
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that this is only two members
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
of the house and I think if we're
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
setting policy we ought to have the
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
house more involved than all of the
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
professionals that are listed here that
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
was item one item two is this appears to
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
me to be only about Revenue it does
 
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
nothing about the employment the
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
lifestyle the open space in the North
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
country and that's a major issue in my
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
mind I think it has to be dealt with now
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
maybe one of these other bodies is but
 
00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of it number three I think
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
it was a typo in line 18 of the page two
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
shall be held within before
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
before you can't have within and before
 
00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:04.150 align:start position:0%
before you can't have within and before
July

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
July
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
31st so the easy one is to typo the hard
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
one is to deal with all of the effects
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
credit I'll call it business is about
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
and I think if we're going to study it
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't just be studying the
 
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't just be studying the
financial

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.509 align:start position:0%
 
impacts

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.710 align:start position:0%
impacts
representative

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
Dar thank you Mr chair very briefly um
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh is correct there's
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
definitely a drafting error in this it
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
should not say dasb it should say- C so
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
this bill the amendment as is can't I
 
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:52.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
through yeah thank you thank you for
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
calling on me thank you for taking my
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
question um just to clar CL ify um you
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
73- sorry I I'm just trying to clarify
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
okay my bigger question my actual
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
question sorry is um is it is there any
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
way it would be possible since it was
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to get this amendment from OSS
 
00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:22.519 align:start position:0%
in time for us to really study and look
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
for typos would it be possible to
 
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
postpone a vote on this amendment and
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
Bill until the next time we
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
exact this bill is an early
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill and it's it's got to be out by next
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
week so so the ear this is
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh 7th the next we we could we could
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
have an executive session up
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
15 Mr chair could we exact
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
potentially uh for five or 10 minutes
 
00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:04.910 align:start position:0%
potentially uh for five or 10 minutes
tomorrow

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon a after session I know that's
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
not all that popular but we could get
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
okay just just throwing it out there or
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
or we could do it Tuesday or Monday but
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
popular well is it is it just the
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
typo no I think there's another typo of
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
course uh the uh Vice chair has just
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
this is going to
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
finance so it will be going to finance
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
so if there is a a typograph
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
typo it could be corrected there I
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
me which're is normally would uh uh yeah
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
we we could always push it off but if we
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
want to we're coming close to the the to
 
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
the deadline on on this bill you have to
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
get it get it over so well let's
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
we'll make that decision when we uh
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
finish the
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
discussion uh let's see who well no is
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
representative L montin had her hand up
 
00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:14.839 align:start position:0%
then go back to I was just going to make
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
another suggestion about executing um
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
maybe at the end of the day today uh
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
that we have people here who are sitting
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
in at are Replacements I don't think
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
it's fair to them to that they should
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
sit through uh through hearings they're
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
here for an hour for exec I don't think
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's if they all want wish to
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
stay uh
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
but we also have to after at the end of
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
the hearing we're going to have to be
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
writing up the blurbs
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
we requirement is you can't leave until
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
you've finished your blurp so we we will
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
be busy after the hearings today so
 
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's but that is an that is something
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
we could
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
do I don't know what whe whether you'll
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
get many people to supp
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to reply to your um
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
comment rep representative harb um
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
mentioning that the typos could be taken
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
care of in finance that's fine with me
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to say that takes care
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
of my concern yeah because people could
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
leave during the hearings
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
yep represent representative Derby uh
 
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you know with the
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
change to this bill um Finance might
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
wave it all together because it no
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's no longer any fiscal
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
impact there's no longer any fiscal
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
impact with it's just when it's just the
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
commission Finance might make wave it
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
altogether so I'm not sure about kick
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.510 align:start position:0%
 
finance

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh I think if I talk to good CH well
 
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
yeah I can always talk to the I can
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
always talk to the chair of Finance not
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
to wave it but uh repres representative
 
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.350 align:start position:0%
to wave it but uh repres representative
it's

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
wolf well if it's not going to
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
finance that's even more than my point
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
that I think this deserves a thorough
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
discussion I don't want to vote no on
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
this bill but I don't want to limit it
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
to just is fiscal impact this has got
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
Major Impact not only in the North
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
Country come come to Sullivan County and
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
guys are going to start taking wood out
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
of production it's going to change the
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
lifestyle so I think it needs a thorough
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
discussion and I don't know how to do it
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
I've been here too many years but I
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
still don't know how to get what I'm
 
00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.750 align:start position:0%
still don't know how to get what I'm
asking

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
for and maybe you can help me Mr chair
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
well I've been here many years
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
too and I'm still learning uh well
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative representative veale then
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to say
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
that we it's like we don't have a
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
bipartisan agreement and it does sound
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
like we have a lot lot of work to do but
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
at the same time so we wouldn't want to
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
EXA this today because we're not all on
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
the same page with the bill but um I
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
mean with the
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm just wondering if
 
00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.630 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm just wondering if
people

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
would consider an amendment and if we
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
that we here uh representative elberger
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
then representative zby thank you Mr
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
chairman just to be clear um I'm subbing
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
hour thank you thank you Mr har um you
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
know I I appreciate the the effort that
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly put into this and
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this is very important to him
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
up up in um in the northern part of the
 
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
state but I do agree with representative
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
mchu this should be um interim study
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
there's too much to do I and
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative wolf there's too much to
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
do we we can't rush
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:32.070 align:start position:0%
do we we can't rush
this

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
har thank you if the if the members are
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about the typos I think that
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
um because it's an early Bill we should
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment that I think other
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
than how many reps everybody seems to be
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
in favor of it um and then if it needs a
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
further Amendment for typos I think we
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
could do a floor amendment when it gets
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
to the house just to when we might even
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
make it bipartisan saying you know we
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
all agree it's just a typo would you
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
accept the floor
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't want to see this bill
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
is important we all agree I don't want
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
to see it die as representative wolf
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
said and because of the time constraints
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
I think we should move it forward with
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's my opinion thank
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative pleas Q representative
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative Bill thank you Mr chair I
 
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
I totally agree with representative harb
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
also if the bill makes it to the Senate
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
it can be you know fixed there but also
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
bills that get enrolled a lot of typos
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
get corrected in the Secretary of
 
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
State's office so I don't think we
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
should get hung up so much on that there
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
there's multiple opportunities to have
 
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.470 align:start position:0%
there's multiple opportunities to have
that

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.470 align:start position:0%
that
fixed

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely rep
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
representative you that representative V
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman um so I think it's now
 
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
actually a little more than a typo um it
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
does mandate legislation and line uh
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
page two line 20 probably should say and
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
may recommend but more important than
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
that so that was uh page two line 20
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
insert in May before recommend but more
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
important than that it it it inserts a
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
new section after section 3A 793b which
 
00:22:27.269 --> 00:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
already exists so I think this should be
 
00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.070 align:start position:0%
already exists so I think this should be
79

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
79
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
see in on page one line n and on the
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
other page where it's referenced uh on
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
line 23 on page two so I think it's
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of stuff wrong with it
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
again agree in principle that we should
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
study it um the question is how and I'm
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
not sure how much I mean you can you can
 
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
fix that onew grammar issue in enrolled
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
bills but I don't know if you can fix
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
the the chaptering or the section
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.470 align:start position:0%
the the chaptering or the section
misplacement

00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
misplacement
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
I I think this would effectively replace
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
that waiver of yield tax and I'm also
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
wondering how it looks at how it
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
considers um uh
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
795 and I think science and technology
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
did look at
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
795 anyhow there's some stuff to discuss
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
on this I'd rather we do it I think this
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
Veil we're up against deadlines and
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to save
 
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.430 align:start position:0%
we're trying to save
time

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
um is there anything that or any
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
Representatives on the committee that
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
want to work on an amendment for the
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
floor and that's my question I think
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that have been
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
raised can be done and um but it would
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
take people to work together and I would
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%

00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
amendment represent representative
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
R yeah I'm going to support the
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
amendment but I do have some issues with
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
on line 18 that the owner would have to
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
provide an affidavit that they're going
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
to live in that domicile for two
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
years um I don't know how it would be
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
enforced or tracked um if someone moves
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
the enforcement I just feel like it's
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
giving this false sense of of security
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
that the uh that there's some investment
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
by the property owner in ensuring that
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
the IC System is going to be well
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
functioning um but like like I said I I
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
just kind of don't like this kind of
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
language in in statute where that we
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
can't enforce
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
it but I'm willing to support the
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think overall it's
 
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.909 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think overall it's
good

00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay is there anyone else wishes to
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
speak to the
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%

prepared a uh cyanobacteria management
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
plan and part of that process was to

have a advisory committee work with them
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
um and Mr chair you were you were a
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
member of that advisory committee and
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
you're aware that um several recom
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
commendations were made in their uh
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
their final report and one of them was
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
to have the uh cyano bacteria management
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
to be to fall under current statute um
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
under the clean Lakes program so that
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does um the
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses a couple issues that
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
were brought up with um by Dees with a
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill actually fishing game um they
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
wanted um to delete reference that their
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
approval would be required um so if you
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
see on the amendment um on line 8 there
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
there was some language in the original
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill but is now dropped it just ends at
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
department and then the other um uh item
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
which was added to the amendment was to
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
allow rule making which um I had
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
neglected to put into the original bill
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
so the new paragraph allowing de to um
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
create Ru making for um when there is a
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
permit application for inl treatments
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
it really does put the cyanobacteria
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
under the clean Lakes program and that's
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%

funds come from and we already have the
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
mitigation revolving fund that's in
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
motion um I believe that this is
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
a a very individualized case um there
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
have been three issues in Nashville over
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years and uh I think Florest
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
and L is against it as well and I
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
let's see who who uh who
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
seconded I second yes you wish to speak
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
on your no thank you on your second uh
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
think uh chair will say that uh we that
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is in the uh it's in the wrong
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
law uh the raw the law is
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's in
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
the yeah yeah it's it discusses it's in
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
the it's in the wrong section of the
 
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.710 align:start position:0%
the it's in the wrong section of the
statute

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
so so uh and
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's we'll uh you know we'll just that's
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
what that's just we'll take it from
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
there uh representative Darby do you
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
have a have a a comment yes thank you Mr
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
chair yes I agree with you the bill as
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
written is definitely in the wrong
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
section uh we saw that we heard that
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
it's in the intent to cut section which
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
affects all timbering um but you've seen
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
that there's an amendment um that's come
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
around that fixes this I think that this
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
is um this is broader than a Nashua
 
00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
issue I think this handle uh uh impacts
 
00:48:46.599 --> 00:48:47.349 align:start position:0%
issue I think this handle uh uh impacts
all

00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities um where uh um where
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
people are cutting um off where people
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
are bringing in contractors to cut
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
things thinking that uh they're
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
following the law when they're not um
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
and so I think that this amendment is uh
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to help resolve those issues
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
so I'll be opposing the itl um in order
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
to um be able to discuss uh a the
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
amendment okay will there anyone else
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:25.950 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
motorboats representative
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
lontine for a motion i' would like a
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
moot make a motion of
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
second oh as I saw representative Dar
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
Darby representative L montain will you
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
just to speak to your motion yes I see
 
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
uh no benefit of this bill at all and I
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
think it um it's really detrimental to
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
safety on the water that um the point of
 
00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
the bill seem to be to allow um a jet
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
skier to pull someone on a ski or other
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
um device with just a simple re hands uh
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
handlebar review mirror instead of the
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
um the only other exception and statute
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
is to have a really broad wide angle
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
mirror an exception to not having an
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
observer so it just uh doesn't seem any
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
safety to speak to your SEC thank you Mr

representative lantin um the bill really
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
um misses some pieces but I was uh
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
particularly taken by the testimony from
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety that said a
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
single Rider wouldn't be able to both
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%

after having discussions with Mr Quinn
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
um very positive meeting um we think we
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
can work on this um to achieve the ends
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
where a Shore an owner of Shoreline
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
property is a aware of their
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the shoreline
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
protection act and and we think that
 
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
there's um opportunities to do that
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
like to have talk to him more about

that it we can accomplish the intent of
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%

20244 0417 H it was distributed in hard

copy and I emailed it out as well uh so
 
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
I move off to pass on the amendment this
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
clarifies the rather confusing
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
language uh for how many people are
 
00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
required to observe is there excuse me
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
is there a second and representative
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%

yep now you may start again thank you Mr
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank representative Derby for
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
the second uh so this clarifies the
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
rather confusing language in current
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
statute uh for how many observers are
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
required for X number of inflatables
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
Uh current statute allows up to six
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
Inflatables to be towed uh this does
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
limit it to two Inflatables unless you
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
have you're having a water ski show and
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
you get a permit or something like that
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
um but it
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
also spells out that one Observer is
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
required for one inflatable with less
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
than three people so essentially two
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
people up to two and two observers for
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
two inflatables for to total of six
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
people and a limit on the Inflatables to
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
two people so we follow that that the
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
fundamental change to current statute is
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
that you can't have six toe lines out um
 
01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
but it's a little bit easier to manage
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
the ones that you do because you don't
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily need one or
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
one uh observing which
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
was statute some time ago actually I
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
hope that makes sense it is
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:35.559 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair so I
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate um representative M working
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
with representative Spain on this
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
amendment um I um I think this is an
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
important safety measure honestly I
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
think that it uh uh significantly
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
improves existing statute with respect
 
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.670 align:start position:0%
improves existing statute with respect
to

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
safety um the and I we also heard the
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
department of safety um state that um
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
there's some inconsistent um enforcement
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
of um of the existing statute um which
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
was one of the causes for the original
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
um Bill and so I I hope that um the
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
department of safety will be able to
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
take what I think is clear guidance in
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
this uh language in terms of uh the
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
number of uh observers that are required
 
01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
per um different combinations of PE uh
 
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
people that are being towed on various
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
devices um and I also specifically
 
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the reduction in the number
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
of tobl because I think that having six
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chairman um I as I am
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
as well in support of the amend
 
01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it makes an advance in
 
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
public safety I too was um my eyes were
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
opened by the thought of picturing six
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
tubes going behind
 
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
one vehicle and the fact that you would
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
have maybe six different children on
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
each of them so at this point I think
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
this is a great Improvement thank you so
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chair I have a
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
question of Representative muu so in
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
your comments about this amendment you
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
said that there's exceptions if there's
 
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.430 align:start position:0%
said that there's exceptions if there's
a

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
ski you know some special show but the
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
last line only refers to skiers so
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
anybody in an inflatable would still not
 
01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
exception on line 10 it says current law
 
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's the current law and
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
there's already language in current law
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
on uh for a water ski
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:54.870 align:start position:0%
on uh for a water ski
show

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
show
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh okay so these Inflatables wouldn't be
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
part of a water ski show then um I don't
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
put on water ski shows so I don't know
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
but uh perhaps you know better since you
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
have a lake house so you do you see
 
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
water shows or I don't
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:21.559 align:start position:0%
don't representative Derby
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative Darby for a comment uh
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um uh to address the
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
question this is this is not trying to
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
change statute for water skew shows and
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
it doesn't um or which are which are
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
really the shows that we would be
 
01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
talking about um it's trying to clarify
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
tubes um and the tubes are the only
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
thing where um where more than two
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
people are allowed and so um
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
so there um we didn't hear any um we
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%

have we have a number of speakers that
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
want to speak on the bill I also know
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
not that there's an amendment that's
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
going to be presented so I feel remissed
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
to have everybody speak on the bill and
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
then we bring up the amendment and then
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
you guys haven't had a chance to discuss
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
the bill as it might be amended so
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
although this may be a little out of the
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
ordinary I'd like to call up um not call

everybody else speaks they'll know that
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment I think that's
 
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:23.639 align:start position:0%
fair to everybody that wants to address
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%

20242
 
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
67h uh makes a technical correction to
 
01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
the uh Bill itself because it adds the
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
town of Hudson Hudson um has wells in
 
01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:23.350 align:start position:0%
town of Hudson Hudson um has wells in
Lichfield

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
Lichfield
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh we draw some of our a substantial
 
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
portion of our water supply comes from
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh Lichfield Lichfield was in the
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
original Bill all this does is ADD
 
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
Hudson into the notification process of
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
the bill so it's a technical type of uh
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
um change to the bill uh the idea is
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
that since we're in the same
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
aquifer town of Hudson should be
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
included so that we we can go forward
 
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
from that that's basically what the bill
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
does thank you any questions for the
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
drinking water had been significantly
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
contaminated by pasas contamination from
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
St gobain a local industrial

largest industrial environmental
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
disaster in New Hampshire's history due
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
to the Past contamination of our Town's
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
air water and soil I'm here today to
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 1114 which will extend the

01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
commission which was first introduced
 
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
and passed as HB
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
737 the P contamination of Southern New
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by a single polluter was the
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
impetus for my filing of that original
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
bill in
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
2019 and Remains the focus of the
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
commission's work HB 1114 if passed will
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
allow the commission to investigate and
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
analyze the an environmental and public
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
health impacts relating to releases of
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
perorin chemicals in the air soil and
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
groundwater in marac Bedford londonairy
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
and Lichfield to continue its work um I
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the amendment and I
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
don't object to it I think it's a great
 
01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
idea I mean um as as the commission's
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
work has gone on we've discovered the
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
extent of the contamination and that's
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
part of the the purpose of this bill was
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
to to uh so I'm sorry that Hudson has to
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
join but I think it's
 
01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.109 align:start position:0%
join but I think it's
completely

01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate um this commission has done
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
great bipartisan work since its
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
Inception and seeks to have the
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to continue that work in
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
addition to our state agencies
 
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:start position:0%

citizen representatives of each impacted
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
Community the tens of thousands of
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
citizens in these impacted communities
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
are relying upon the commission to be
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
their voice as you know contaminants
 
01:25:26.109 --> 01:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
like pasas in our environment increase
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
risk not only to the environment but to
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
Public Health as well the cost of
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
installing in home filtration for those
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
with private Wells that have been
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
contaminated by pest some of whom are
 
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
not eligible for rebate problem programs
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
is huge New Hampshire citizens are
 
01:25:43.709 --> 01:25:43.719 align:start position:0%

01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
their own towns
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
and some of those in particularly impact
 
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
TS like those subjected uh to study by
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
this commission are reporting increased
 
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
incidence of negative Health outcomes
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
like cancer thyroid disorders
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
Etc the current pasas commission has
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
been instrumental in seeking and
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
requesting the collection of Health Data
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
relative to these health concerns and
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
spearheading the legislation to address
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
this issue the determination by New

01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
cancers um more than other communities a
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
health outcome known to be associated
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
with pasas exposure came as a result of
 
01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
the commission's work to closely examine
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%

its intended closure sometime in 2024
 
01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
will not relieve the commission of any
 
01:27:07.149 --> 01:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
of its work though the polluter May
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
intend to leave the area the impacts of
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
its polluting production practices on

a subcommittee of wh World Health

Organization declared that pooa
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
chemicals are without doubt
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic they also saying that P
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
posos pfos chemicals are very likely

01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
been in here since 2016 we have
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
suspected um that these chemicals are
 
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
destroying our town we now have proof um
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
as representative Murphy mentioned St
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
Goan which is the offender in our town
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
has announced that they're they're
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
leaving um our town has not been invited
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
to the table regarding closure on on how
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to close the facility what
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to do with the land what
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to do with the equipment
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
inside the building that is contaminated
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
so we need some sort of ongoing
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
oversight of of this uh we also need um
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's an ongoing need in New Hampshire
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
for education to Medical
 
01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.430 align:start position:0%
for education to Medical
providers

01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think many of you know I have um a
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
cancer that's related to pest um and
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
when I brought I had my blood tested and
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
I have over 12 I have 12 chemicals in my
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
blood that are over the toxic limit
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's allowed for humans when I brought
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
my test results to my surgeon she she
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
without even opening them without
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
looking at them she pushed them back to
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
me and she said I'm just a surgeon I
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't need to know about
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
pest she's no longer my surgeon I fired
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
her um I'm not going to put up with
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
incompetence um especially when the last
 
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
eight years of my life has been working
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
to to hold these uh people
 
01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
accountable um cancer studies were were
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned we've got kidney cancer
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
studies we have an ongoing breast cancer
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
study that's being done by Dartmouth
 
01:30:37.149 --> 01:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock and I just want to leave you

photo image of what it's like to live in
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
a town that is contaminated with pay and
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
has been contaminated for years I live
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
in an older neighborhood that AB buts an
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
even older neighborhood that where they
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
all have private Wells so on my street
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
there we have four houses that have
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
private Wells now we live three miles
 
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
from St gobain so the state had told us
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
we were safe um in house number one all
 
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
all four of those cell of of those Wells
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
are contaminated in house number one the
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
dad has died of of kidney cancer in
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
house number two the dad and the adult
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
son have died of colon cancer this is my
 
01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.270 align:start position:0%
son have died of colon cancer this is my
street

01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%

01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
house number three the dad is dying of
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
stage four prostate cancer house number
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
four is my house in 2022 I was diagnosed
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
with breast cancer and in
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
2019 my husband had to have a
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
quadruple cardiac bypass at age
 
01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
55 all of those are conditions that are
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
related to Chronic past exposure so this
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
is something it's it's not going away
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
they're called Forever chemicals because
 
01:31:57.109 --> 01:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
they are here forever and we need
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
oversight through this committee to
 
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
protect our citizens and to figure out
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
how to move forward I'll take any

you we're here to ask for your support
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
for the amendment um Hudson has three
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
water supply wells in the town of
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
Lichfield they prod they provide water
 
01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
for Hudson and Lichfield and we are
 
01:32:59.229 --> 01:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
currently working or dealing with st
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
gobain so we are well aware of this
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
issue we just ask for your consideration
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
Hudson and I'll just add you know
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm also in favor of this uh
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
my name is Elvis Dio for the record I'm
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
a town engineer in Hudson and um one of
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
our wells had to be shut down because of
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
the p levels on it so we are we're we're
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
being impacted financially significantly
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
but also we had to make certain
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
adjustments to accommodate for the
 
01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
additional Supply that we need to feed
 
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
um and provide water and fire
 
01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
suppression for Hudson leechfield and
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
London der as well uh the way the
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
network in Hudson is connected is we're
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
connected to London da pelum as well so
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh this is not just for Hudson this is
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
for the communities adjacent to us um so
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
we feel that this is just simply an
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
extension of what's already in place if
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
Lichfield is in and our wells are in
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
Lichfield therefore we should be also
 
01:33:59.310 --> 01:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
included into as well it it makes sense
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
from our standpoint and we apologize for
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
coming at the last minute to add this we
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
were not aware of this and uh we were
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
made aware of it so hopefully uh uh
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
rather um do it now than never so we we
 
01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your time thank you thank
 
01:34:15.629 --> 01:34:15.639 align:start position:0%

01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%

01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
comment than a
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
question um do any questions for them
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%

people here in time to the to me it's
 
01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
really important to extend this
 
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
committee and we don't really there's no
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%

as you know um pasas is impacting a lot
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
of communities in Southern New Hampshire
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
um I I was using the uh de's um P um map
 
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
and saw that Amhurst for example is um
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
very specifically impacted now I
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
recognize this commission is going is
 
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
already very large and it's really
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
focused on the S coane pollution um but
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
do you have any suggestion does the DS
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
have any suggestions on how um these
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
other communities um there near the Sea
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
Coast um could uh how what we could do
 
01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
at at the legislature to support these
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
other communities that are being so um
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
P thank you for the question uh it's a
 
01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
big one and I before responding I really
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
want to talk to the director wisat for a
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
good response on that question if you
 
01:37:23.159 --> 01:37:25.030 align:start position:0%
good response on that question if you
don't

01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
mind thank you any other questions
 
01:37:27.639 --> 01:37:28.950 align:start position:0%
mind thank you any other questions
representative

01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
Donnelly um thank you for letting me
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
take this
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
question I see towns being added and and
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
back to representative Derby I see this
 
01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
is as this could be expansive is Dees um
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
looking at this and saying this is only
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
The Limited towns or will they expand
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
beyond the towns based on their
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
investigation well it's not our
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
commission um and the directive of the
 
01:37:56.589 --> 01:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
commission was really to focus on the
 
01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
area of s gobain based on these consent
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
decree thank you any other
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else who

wishes to speak I don't have any pink
 
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:15.880 align:start position:0%

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.270 align:start position:0%
 
Christopher

01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
Christopher
 
01:38:39.149 --> 01:38:39.159 align:start position:0%
bandis to help you out yes thank you for
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
the record uh go ahead Chris thank you
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman honorable members of the
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Chris bandasi
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
and I am the uh rep government
 
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative from the town of bed
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
referred to the commission as well as
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
the chair of the HB 737 study commission
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
and I think as you've heard the
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
collection of data both Health Data and
 
01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
environmental data is very much in its
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
middle to early early to Middle stages
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh the analysis of the data and the
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
conclusions that we can draw from it are
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
far from uh in a position to be
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
completed uh perhaps in five years the
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
mission of the we may Pat our elves on
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
the back and say mission accomplished
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
but we're we're nowhere near there uh
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
there are a number of uh things that I
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
would point to just very briefly uh pooa
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh use at the Sango ban plant was
 
01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
discontinued about 17 years ago and yet
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
we continue to see its persistence and
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
VI and volatility in the environment
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
both in uh marac Village District Supply
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
Wells as well as in uh private Wells
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
throughout our communities um it's
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
interesting as we begin to resample
 
01:39:59.310 --> 01:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
Wells that Wells that were thought to be
 
01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
safe uh 5 to 10% turn out to be above
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
the limits on second samplings who knows
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
how long they were above the limits or
 
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
below the limits we simply don't know uh
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
but there certainly is risk there and of
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
those that were close to the limits but
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
below 20 to 30% tests above so there
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
still is a health risk out there uh that
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
is that can't be fully
 
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
assessed the uh Dees is working out a
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater management uh permit with
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
Senco bang that will include some
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring requirements that data is
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
obviously not available and won't be
 
01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
available until 2025 and Beyond uh to
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
see what the persistent effects continue
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
to be on the health side as has been
 
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're uh entering phase three
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
of a cancer study those results might be
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
known in 2025 or 2026 and certainly
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're not in a position to make re
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the legislature about
 
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
those and we also uh have a couple of
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are going to be regulated
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
federally and probably in the state of
 
01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well very soon that
 
01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
were in m in use much much longer than
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
pfoa and that have proved to be harmful
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
um in medical studies so there is much
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
work that continues to be done um
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
certainly there's impact to Hudson uh as
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
well as other surrounding communities we
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
have a little cauldron of activity in
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
our s gobain region but certainly much
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
of what we learn is transferable to the
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state where we know
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's low levels in surface soils even
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
in the remotest parts of the state so um
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and we would ask for your
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%

adding a community to the 737 commission
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
is not new I introduced a bill last term
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
to add londonairy when we discovered
 
01:44:43.149 --> 01:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
they were an impacted Community from the
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
s o Bain contamination so this isn't
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
anything new and as what was previously
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
testified Hudson is a very critical
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
Community to have part of this because
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%

01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
of the pasas commission for its first
 
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
four years and I've seen it be an
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
incredible resource to collect
 
01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
information to understand the
 
01:47:13.790 --> 01:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
progression and the enforcement of the
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
consent agree between um the state and
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh s oain um I've seen us do some very
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
important work with Outreach to
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
constituents in those communities giving
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
them a way of sharing their concerns and
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
questions even just managing the bottled
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
water program um really in involves many
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
members of the commission to make sure
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
our constituents needs are being met so
 
01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
I I we are not done um the
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
decommissioning of that facility is
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
going to require a lot of oversight and
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
communication with impacted stakeholders
 
01:47:49.709 --> 01:47:49.719 align:start position:0%
so I think it makes a lot of sense to
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
have it in have it proceed particularly
 
01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:53.719 align:start position:0%
with representatives from the town of
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
Hudson to help keep us informed on
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure expansion thank you and
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%

process as we know New Hampshire is
 
02:57:11.550 --> 02:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing unprecedented growth due to
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%

02:57:17.830 --> 02:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
work of our legislative body and

work of our legislative body and

02:57:19.830 --> 02:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:57:23.550 --> 02:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
regulations if for example a business
 
02:57:26.750 --> 02:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
wishes to build a golf course a large
 
02:57:31.349 --> 02:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
condo complex or an industrial complex a
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
Dependable water source is a
 
02:57:37.550 --> 02:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
requirement our New Hampshire Department
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services has already
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
defined a comprehensive process that
 
02:57:49.030 --> 02:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
requires permits for Wells that withdraw
 
02:57:52.190 --> 02:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
groundwater at an average rate of 40
 
02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
gallons per minute or
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
57,600 gallons per day or
 
02:58:03.229 --> 02:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
more as currently defined by law in
 
02:58:06.150 --> 02:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
order to obtain a large groundwater
 
02:58:09.229 --> 02:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
withdrawal permit the applicant must
 
02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
complete an extensive testing and review
 
02:58:15.950 --> 02:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
process this application must be
 
02:58:18.510 --> 02:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
forwarded to the governing B bodies of
 
02:58:22.670 --> 02:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
each municipality that is potentially
 
02:58:25.389 --> 02:58:25.399 align:start position:0%
impacted next the Department of
 
02:58:28.590 --> 02:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services will conduct a
 
02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the proposed
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
application within 30 days notice of
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
this public hearing is currently
 
02:58:40.950 --> 02:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
required to be published in local
 
02:58:43.950 --> 02:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
newspapers and posted in two public
 
02:58:43.960 --> 02:58:45.469 align:start position:0%
newspapers and posted in two public
public

02:58:45.469 --> 02:58:45.479 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:58:48.830 --> 02:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
places as you can see New Hampshire has
 
02:58:52.429 --> 02:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
a robust process for reviewing and
 
02:58:55.150 --> 02:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
making decisions on new large
 
02:58:57.790 --> 02:58:57.800 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawals and the
 
02:59:00.110 --> 02:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
02:59:03.269 --> 02:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
does a phenomenal job at monitoring
 
02:59:06.030 --> 02:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
applications testing and
 
02:59:09.030 --> 02:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
reviewing however the notification
 
02:59:11.550 --> 02:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
process to residents of municipalities
 
02:59:14.670 --> 02:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
that may be potentially impacted
 
02:59:18.309 --> 02:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
needs to be updated unfortunately many
 
02:59:20.790 --> 02:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
communities are no longer served by
 
02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:21.790 align:start position:0%
communities are no longer served by
local

02:59:21.790 --> 02:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:59:24.349 --> 02:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
newspapers and town officials have
 
02:59:27.030 --> 02:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
limited ability to connect with
 
02:59:30.510 --> 02:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
residents without being timely or uh
 
02:59:33.550 --> 02:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
without being costly or time
 
02:59:37.309 --> 02:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
consuming so this bill as amended is
 
02:59:41.630 --> 02:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
really a minor technical correction to
 
02:59:44.870 --> 02:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
add to the notification process C of a
 
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing and this is how the bill
 
02:59:50.830 --> 02:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
will do it in addition to the
 
02:59:54.269 --> 02:59:54.279 align:start position:0%
publication in a newspaper and being
 
02:59:59.349 --> 02:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
posted on other uh media sites this bill
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
asks the applicant to provide written
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
notice of the public hearing by mail to
 
03:00:08.990 --> 03:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
Property Owners or residents within
 
03:00:13.110 --> 03:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
about a 2 mile radius of the pro project
 
03:00:16.070 --> 03:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
and this will will be able to facilitate
 
03:00:16.080 --> 03:00:17.110 align:start position:0%
and this will will be able to facilitate
full

03:00:17.110 --> 03:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
full
 
03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
transparency and let residents know that
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
they should attend the public hearing it
 
03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
also alleviates a lot of the workload
 
03:00:28.110 --> 03:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
and questions that come into the town
 
03:00:31.309 --> 03:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
clerk's office if information is
 
03:00:35.630 --> 03:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
published and uh not very clear the form
 
03:00:37.750 --> 03:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
and content of the notice will be
 
03:00:39.630 --> 03:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
adopted through
 
03:00:43.710 --> 03:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
rules and the list of persons notified
 
03:00:45.710 --> 03:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
through the property tax role will be
 
03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
sent to the town clerk or Town
 
03:00:51.030 --> 03:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
Administrator as an addition to the
 
03:00:53.309 --> 03:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
application now this is very important
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
please note sections C and D of the bill
 
03:01:04.269 --> 03:01:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:07.830 --> 03:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
d394 and therefore the fiscal note is no
 
03:01:11.710 --> 03:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
longer applicable so the bill is really
 
03:01:15.070 --> 03:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
about just updating the the notification
 
03:01:18.349 --> 03:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
process by a letter from the applicant
 
03:01:21.110 --> 03:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
to Residents that are potentially
 
03:01:24.389 --> 03:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
impacted large groundwater applications
 
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
are meticulously monitored and re
 
03:01:29.429 --> 03:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the New Hampshire Department
 
03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
of Environmental
 
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
Services currently there are only eight
 
03:01:36.590 --> 03:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
applications under review and the
 
03:01:39.309 --> 03:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
process could take a minimum of 18
 
03:01:40.950 --> 03:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
months to
 
03:01:43.830 --> 03:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
complete this Common Sense bill is is
 
03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
narrowly focused on updating the
 
03:01:49.670 --> 03:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
notification process to provide much
 
03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
needed transparency and consistency to
 
03:01:55.110 --> 03:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
Residents that may be potentially
 
03:01:58.550 --> 03:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
impacted to just attend the public
 
03:02:00.910 --> 03:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
hearing where they will be able to get
 
03:02:03.710 --> 03:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
all of their questions answered instead
 
03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
of calling their local Town Clerk or
 
03:02:10.309 --> 03:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
municipality where they would not be
 
03:02:12.870 --> 03:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
able to uh fully answer all of the
 
03:02:12.880 --> 03:02:14.630 align:start position:0%
able to uh fully answer all of the
questions

03:02:14.630 --> 03:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:02:17.110 --> 03:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
so believe it or not even though there
 
03:02:20.269 --> 03:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
are only eight applications under review
 
03:02:23.110 --> 03:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
currently two of those applications
 
03:02:25.710 --> 03:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
directly impacted my district Hampton
 
03:02:29.309 --> 03:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
Falls and Kensington what are the odds
 
03:02:31.910 --> 03:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
so I learned about this
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
process firsthand by actually attending
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
our public hearing but there was a
 
03:02:39.630 --> 03:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion about the
 
03:02:43.030 --> 03:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
notification process so in Kensington
 
03:02:45.510 --> 03:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
residents really did not have a great
 
03:02:48.670 --> 03:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
way to understand it it caused a lot of
 
03:02:51.309 --> 03:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
confusion and the board of Selectmen and
 
03:02:54.229 --> 03:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
the town clerk spent weeks trying to
 
03:02:57.790 --> 03:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
field uh questions that they really
 
03:03:00.510 --> 03:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
needed that would have been alleviated
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
if they had just attended the public
 
03:03:06.590 --> 03:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
session knowing that when this when this
 
03:03:09.469 --> 03:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
application came to Hampton Falls I knew
 
03:03:11.389 --> 03:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
enough to try to say okay we've got to
 
03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
get the word out some way but was very
 
03:03:17.349 --> 03:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
difficult for the town to try to reach
 
03:03:19.469 --> 03:03:19.479 align:start position:0%
the appropriate residents and it took
 
03:03:22.670 --> 03:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
time away from the town clerk's office
 
03:03:26.349 --> 03:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
so by having this simple letter to the
 
03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
residents it to attend the public
 
03:03:31.590 --> 03:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
hearing it would have alleviated a lot
 
03:03:35.150 --> 03:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
of confusion but the hearing itself was
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
extremely beneficial so the residents
 
03:03:40.670 --> 03:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
were able to ask a lot of questions and
 
03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
it really cut down on a lot of confusion
 
03:03:48.110 --> 03:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
therefore I respectfully ask for
 
03:03:51.429 --> 03:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
unanimous bipartisan support of this
 
03:03:53.469 --> 03:03:53.479 align:start position:0%
house bill as
 
03:03:56.429 --> 03:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
amended to recommend ought to passed
 
03:04:00.030 --> 03:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
with the amendment to send a strong and
 
03:04:02.910 --> 03:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
unified message so this bill can be
 
03:04:06.590 --> 03:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
moved to the consent calendar thank
 
03:04:09.469 --> 03:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
you any
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
questions any questions or members of
 
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:22.469 --> 03:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
representative okay representative harb
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
then representative Dar thank you Mr
 
03:04:25.910 --> 03:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
03:04:28.670 --> 03:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question I actually have two
 
03:04:31.630 --> 03:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering where you created the
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
10,500 foot over 12 mile radius and um
 
03:04:40.830 --> 03:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
wondered does this bill really say how
 
03:04:43.389 --> 03:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
the applicant would verify who the
 
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
owners or residents are within that
 
03:04:50.229 --> 03:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
radius so it um it should be a um about
 
03:04:53.229 --> 03:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
a two mile radius and the applicant
 
03:04:57.150 --> 03:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
would use the um property tax bills to
 
03:04:59.469 --> 03:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
be able to create that list and of
 
03:05:02.710 --> 03:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
course it it it is an approximation so
 
03:05:05.070 --> 03:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
that at least we make sure that we're
 
03:05:07.670 --> 03:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
notice notifying the residents that may
 
03:05:11.269 --> 03:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
be impacted in addition in addition to
 
03:05:14.830 --> 03:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
the public notice and the new newspaper
 
03:05:16.950 --> 03:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
notice so it's a little bit more
 
03:05:19.750 --> 03:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
targeted than the than a random
 
03:05:22.110 --> 03:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
newspaper notice that most people
 
03:05:24.110 --> 03:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't see in Hampton Falls
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
and kensing Kensington I could tell you
 
03:05:30.790 --> 03:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
we just don't have a local newspaper
 
03:05:34.990 --> 03:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:37.870 --> 03:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
followup I'm trying to follow you but
 
03:05:41.269 --> 03:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
who said and what experts said to make
 
03:05:45.030 --> 03:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
it the 10,500 feet why isn't it 20,000
 
03:05:47.590 --> 03:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
ft why isn't it 2,000 ft I'm just
 
03:05:49.590 --> 03:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
wondering where you came up with that
 
03:05:52.910 --> 03:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
number I worked with uh the Selectmen in
 
03:05:56.110 --> 03:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
both towns to get their perspective on
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
what they felt would be um appropriate
 
03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
notification to get people to the public
 
03:06:04.269 --> 03:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
meeting thank
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Derby thank you Mr
 
03:06:10.750 --> 03:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
chair I have very similar questions did
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
you um did you notice the the language
 
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
in 45 c21
 
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
v um which talks about the
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are impacted um
 
03:06:25.830 --> 03:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's there's it's based on the Hy H
 
03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
hydrographic models I guess to determine
 
03:06:31.389 --> 03:06:31.399 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and using that same
 
03:06:32.990 --> 03:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism rather than
 
03:06:36.670 --> 03:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
an uh excuse my language arbitrary
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
number um to determine the impact of
 
03:06:40.630 --> 03:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
residence have you considered that well
 
03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
this has no nothing well this is really
 
03:06:46.030 --> 03:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
just to get some notification to
 
03:06:49.389 --> 03:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
Residents to attend a public session not
 
03:06:51.950 --> 03:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
indicating that they would be impacted
 
03:06:54.590 --> 03:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
one way or another but just a better way
 
03:06:58.510 --> 03:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
to provide that transparency to um
 
03:07:00.710 --> 03:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
residents of a town that they should
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
attend the public meeting and then
 
03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully they'll bring their neighbors
 
03:07:07.389 --> 03:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
with them and get the word out just so
 
03:07:09.910 --> 03:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
they attend the public session so that a
 
03:07:12.349 --> 03:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
lot of the V this is a really technical
 
03:07:14.910 --> 03:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
area and most people don't understand I
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't anything about
 
03:07:20.389 --> 03:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawal the tests how how
 
03:07:24.389 --> 03:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
it happens what is the testing process
 
03:07:26.229 --> 03:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
and how do they come up with a
 
03:07:29.150 --> 03:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
determination and that is very well
 
03:07:31.229 --> 03:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
documented the department does a
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job with it but this is just
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
to get people to attend a public public
 
03:07:42.630 --> 03:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
hearing and it's unfortunately it's
 
03:07:45.150 --> 03:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
difficult to get people together to
 
03:07:47.670 --> 03:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
attend these hearings and I'm sure as
 
03:07:50.110 --> 03:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
the deliberative sessions are going on
 
03:07:52.990 --> 03:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
in all these towns all of our towns you
 
03:07:55.790 --> 03:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
know we show up but you look around and
 
03:07:57.950 --> 03:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
it's just very hard to get people to
 
03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
attend so hopefully a letter will um let
 
03:08:04.750 --> 03:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
residents know that they just need to
 
03:08:07.950 --> 03:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
session follow up and then thank you Mr
 
03:08:12.590 --> 03:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you again representative
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question if the if the
 
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
radius sort of this circle um just sort
 
03:08:19.950 --> 03:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
of crosses a portion like a corner of
 
03:08:21.910 --> 03:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
their property would that be inclusive
 
03:08:23.030 --> 03:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
for them to be
 
03:08:27.309 --> 03:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
notified well it would have to
 
03:08:32.070 --> 03:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
um I would yes it yes yeah I think the
 
03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
better more transparency is always
 
03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
better because again it's just to attend
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
a public hearing so I'm sure residents
 
03:08:42.550 --> 03:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
would want to know that there might be a
 
03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
golf course course going in you they if
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
they live on a on the line of a town
 
03:08:49.790 --> 03:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
they may be very interested that a golf
 
03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
course or an industrial complex or a
 
03:08:55.630 --> 03:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
large condo complex could be going in
 
03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
you know very close to where they live
 
03:09:01.710 --> 03:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
so it's a a great way to get residents
 
03:09:04.750 --> 03:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
involved in what's happening in their in
 
03:09:07.510 --> 03:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
that could impact their town thank you
 
03:09:10.750 --> 03:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ron thank you
 
03:09:12.110 --> 03:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
03:09:13.630 --> 03:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
I actually have a couple of them one um
 
03:09:20.070 --> 03:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's not stated in the bill but as far
 
03:09:23.150 --> 03:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
as um the notice like in the newspapers
 
03:09:26.750 --> 03:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
and around town would you be um open to
 
03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
also ensuring that that if the town has
 
03:09:32.590 --> 03:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
a website that it's posted there as well
 
03:09:34.030 --> 03:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
um because a lot of people don't even
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
see the you know I I I share your your
 
03:09:41.830 --> 03:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
electronic electronic posting would be
 
03:09:43.469 --> 03:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
great also and
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
some towns have websites some they don't
 
03:09:49.389 --> 03:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
but yeah absolutely we actually have a
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
website in both towns that uh I
 
03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
represent and
 
03:09:57.309 --> 03:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's Hit or Miss if people
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
actually go to the site to know that you
 
03:10:02.190 --> 03:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
know there's there will be a public
 
03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
hearing okay and then um one other
 
03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
question is um regarding the the letters
 
03:10:11.550 --> 03:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
that go out to the those people in that
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
broad area I can think of a situations
 
03:10:17.309 --> 03:10:17.319 align:start position:0%
where there may be an area where there's
 
03:10:19.950 --> 03:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of population served by Municipal
 
03:10:23.790 --> 03:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
Water and not private Wells so would
 
03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
they be included here is it really the
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
notification goes to uh property owners
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
who have private Wells that may be
 
03:10:32.910 --> 03:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
impacted by the large groundwater
 
03:10:35.590 --> 03:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal yes definitely the private
 
03:10:38.670 --> 03:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
Wells but if it's applicable to a public
 
03:10:41.309 --> 03:10:41.319 align:start position:0%
Supply and that definitely has happened
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
on the Sea Coast again again we just
 
03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that there's
 
03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
notification to let residents know that
 
03:10:54.110 --> 03:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's some type of um reason for this
 
03:10:57.030 --> 03:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawal it's it's going
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
to be a
 
03:10:58.720 --> 03:11:00.469 align:start position:0%
to be a
major

03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
major
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
um complex or something happening that
 
03:11:06.269 --> 03:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
they need to be aware of okay thank you
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
because of the because of the large um
 
03:11:11.550 --> 03:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
or the requirement that the there has to
 
03:11:13.750 --> 03:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
be a lot of water water coming out of
 
03:11:16.429 --> 03:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
the ground so something big is happening
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it's just that notice hey come to
 
03:11:21.590 --> 03:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the meeting and we want to discuss
 
03:11:24.990 --> 03:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
what's happening okay thank you very

plastow um I fully support this bill as
 
03:12:09.630 --> 03:12:09.640 align:start position:0%
as amended uh hence again the fiscal
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
note is no longer relevant um this bill
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
is about
 
03:12:19.269 --> 03:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
transparency uh Susan and I had an
 
03:12:23.070 --> 03:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
extended uh conference call with Dees uh
 
03:12:26.349 --> 03:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
late last year when this bill was being
 
03:12:29.550 --> 03:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh considered uh about the process
 
03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:30.910 align:start position:0%
uh considered uh about the process
associated

03:12:30.910 --> 03:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
associated
 
03:12:33.950 --> 03:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
with advancing these kinds of
 
03:12:37.950 --> 03:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
permits um we have absolutely no problem
 
03:12:39.550 --> 03:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
with their procedure their testing
 
03:12:42.110 --> 03:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
procedures and what they do and how they
 
03:12:43.469 --> 03:12:43.479 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
03:12:45.710 --> 03:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
remediation uh in the event that there's
 
03:12:49.389 --> 03:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
a problem that's discovered uh and and
 
03:12:51.429 --> 03:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's a good process that the state
 
03:12:55.030 --> 03:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
has the concern that we have is one of
 
03:12:58.870 --> 03:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
transparency of what is going on so that
 
03:13:01.349 --> 03:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
people understand that this test is
 
03:13:04.269 --> 03:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
going to go on what its impacts are and
 
03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
they come to that public hearing they'll
 
03:13:09.870 --> 03:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
understand hydrogeologically they may be
 
03:13:12.070 --> 03:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
in an area that could be impacted or
 
03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
area that's
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
not remotely likely to be impacted um
 
03:13:20.590 --> 03:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
and if impacted what the procedures are
 
03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
to uh seek remediation so this is just a
 
03:13:27.790 --> 03:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
transparency Bill let's let people know
 
03:13:30.670 --> 03:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have newspapers or other
 
03:13:32.710 --> 03:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles that really get the news out
 
03:13:35.349 --> 03:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
anymore yes there are some websites many
 
03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
of them are friends of the town and some
 
03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
people participate and others don't um
 
03:13:44.710 --> 03:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
so I look at this very similar to the
 
03:13:47.190 --> 03:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
letter I I got
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
from the uh uh the folks that were doing
 
03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
the uh re-evaluation in the towns okay
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
your Town's up for reevaluation here's a
 
03:13:58.750 --> 03:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
letter we'll be coming through your area
 
03:14:01.150 --> 03:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
and such and such a Time blah blah blah
 
03:14:03.389 --> 03:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
and if you want to know more about this
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know you can find additional
 
03:14:07.790 --> 03:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
information this is a letter telling
 
03:14:09.630 --> 03:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
them there's going to be a hearing
 
03:14:11.830 --> 03:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
explaining what's going to go on what
 
03:14:14.190 --> 03:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing why we're doing
 
03:14:18.070 --> 03:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
it Hampton Falls is being impacted by by
 
03:14:21.870 --> 03:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
a well that exiter wants to uh to to uh
 
03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
put in because they're a growing Town
 
03:14:26.750 --> 03:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
Kensington wants to be impacted will be
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
impacted by a wellet seabook wants to uh
 
03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
to drill because they need more water uh
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
I live in Southampton we already have a
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
well that seab Brook draws from um so
 
03:14:40.710 --> 03:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
this this is going to continue to be an
 
03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
issue in uh in growing communities where
 
03:14:46.190 --> 03:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
the need for more water exists and
 
03:14:47.950 --> 03:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
people want to know what's going on in
 
03:14:50.349 --> 03:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
their town and will they be impacted and
 
03:14:53.790 --> 03:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
if they will how do I deal with it or if
 
03:14:56.070 --> 03:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be impacted fine I
 
03:14:58.469 --> 03:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
03:15:04.150 --> 03:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:06.910 --> 03:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative R thank you Mr
 
03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:15:12.670 --> 03:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
question um when a project like this is
 
03:15:13.910 --> 03:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
going in obviously it's going to be
 
03:15:15.910 --> 03:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
really big it's taken out a lot of water
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
are there other public hearings around
 
03:15:19.189 --> 03:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
it would it have gone to like the
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
planning board or the zoning board
 
03:15:24.990 --> 03:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
before and did I'm assuming they have
 
03:15:28.750 --> 03:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
public hearings too right yes but how
 
03:15:30.349 --> 03:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
many people show up at the planning
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
board or zoning board meetings I'm chair
 
03:15:34.309 --> 03:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
of the Zoning Board in my town the only
 
03:15:35.710 --> 03:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
people that show up are the people that
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
are impacted by the by the exact issue
 
03:15:43.150 --> 03:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
on the table and and so it it and and
 
03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
again they are noticed by newspaper
 
03:15:46.080 --> 03:15:47.309 align:start position:0%
again they are noticed by newspaper
articles

03:15:47.309 --> 03:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
articles
 
03:15:49.990 --> 03:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
that most people don't read don't know
 
03:15:53.309 --> 03:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
anything about so this this will be
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
something that makes it clear to
 
03:15:57.469 --> 03:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
everyone because you're getting a letter
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a hearing on this
 
03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
subject matter we're going to explain it
 
03:16:03.750 --> 03:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
to you and and you can understand the
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.309 --> 03:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
you I have a I have a question I
 
03:16:16.349 --> 03:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
would it would it be
 
03:16:18.710 --> 03:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh they're very different there are
 
03:16:21.229 --> 03:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
different levels of mail uh you know the
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
first class mail costs fairly
 
03:16:27.150 --> 03:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
significant but there as you go down you
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
there are bulk postcards postcards
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's there there there is commercial
 
03:16:34.110 --> 03:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
mail there's what you're
 
03:16:37.150 --> 03:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
advertising they have various levels is
 
03:16:40.269 --> 03:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
there any thought about that
 
03:16:43.189 --> 03:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh we we didn't get into that level of
 
03:16:46.429 --> 03:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
detail but I'm I'm certain that you know
 
03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
as long as the notice is made clear um
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
the cheapest form of making it clear is
 
03:16:55.269 --> 03:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
yeah reasonable okay I read the I read
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
the coupons faster than I read the the
 
03:17:01.950 --> 03:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
news thank you anyone else
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative Elber thank you Mr
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
chairman just as
 
03:17:09.870 --> 03:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
a sort of an added piece are your
 
03:17:12.910 --> 03:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
hearings uh available on Zoom so people
 
03:17:15.469 --> 03:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
who might be interested but can't get
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
there they're taking care of their
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
children or whatever they may be doing
 
03:17:20.830 --> 03:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
can they watch it from home that's a
 
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
question for Dees who I'm sure is going
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
to be up
 
03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
next you're right anyone
 
03:17:31.309 --> 03:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
03:17:35.590 --> 03:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
Point yes what is the threshold for the
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
notification in like gallons per minute
 
03:17:40.030 --> 03:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
gallons per
 
03:17:42.790 --> 03:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
hour whe whether it's a large large
 
03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
water uh removal um yeah well what does
 
03:17:50.070 --> 03:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
large exactly
 
03:17:55.910 --> 03:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:58.269 --> 03:17:58.279 align:start position:0%
that 40 gallons per minute and then
 
03:17:59.870 --> 03:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's a there's how many gallons
 
03:18:01.870 --> 03:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to take out over a certain
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
time frame I don't remember the numbers
 
03:18:05.910 --> 03:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
off the top of my
 
03:18:10.630 --> 03:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
head represent Kelly you do have a
 
03:18:12.670 --> 03:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
seeing no
 
03:18:17.830 --> 03:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:21.429 --> 03:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:21.439 --> 03:18:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
Kieran

03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
03:18:38.670 --> 03:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Brandon kernin I'm the
 
03:18:39.990 --> 03:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
administrator of the drinking water and
 
03:18:42.990 --> 03:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau at Dees also I
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
started Dees over 24 years ago and my
 
03:18:48.030 --> 03:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
first role was to develop the large
 
03:18:49.830 --> 03:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater jaw printing program so
 
03:18:52.910 --> 03:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
since day one I'm very familiar very
 
03:18:54.030 --> 03:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
03:18:58.429 --> 03:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
it um I want to I want to thank you for
 
03:19:00.269 --> 03:19:00.279 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify on House Bill
 
03:19:02.830 --> 03:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
1326 this would apply to Public Water
 
03:19:05.150 --> 03:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
Systems and Commercial and agricultural
 
03:19:06.469 --> 03:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
entities that are developing new
 
03:19:07.750 --> 03:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawals that's a
 
03:19:09.550 --> 03:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
withdrawal it's pumping 40 gallons a
 
03:19:12.670 --> 03:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
minute 24 hours a day or 57,000
 
03:19:14.630 --> 03:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
600 gallons a
 
03:19:17.790 --> 03:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
day um large any large ground water draw
 
03:19:20.750 --> 03:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
developed after July 1998 has to get a
 
03:19:23.110 --> 03:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
large groundwater withdrawal permit um
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:19:27.070 --> 03:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
1326 however would change the process we
 
03:19:29.309 --> 03:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
currently have first of all it would
 
03:19:32.550 --> 03:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
require that that an applicant notify in
 
03:19:34.910 --> 03:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
writing all owners or residents within
 
03:19:38.309 --> 03:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
10,500 foot radius of a proposed large
 
03:19:40.229 --> 03:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
ground groundwater drawal I just want to
 
03:19:42.349 --> 03:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
emphasize radius that's half a circle so
 
03:19:45.550 --> 03:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
that's 21,000 ft all the way around so
 
03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
the distance is quite
 
03:19:51.429 --> 03:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
substantial it in also as proposed but
 
03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
now the amendment eliminates it it would
 
03:19:54.910 --> 03:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
have required that Dees do testing if
 
03:19:56.710 --> 03:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
requested by the resident but I won't
 
03:19:58.349 --> 03:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
comment on that given that the sponsors
 
03:20:01.269 --> 03:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment to remove those
 
03:20:03.429 --> 03:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
Provisions we really do appreciate the
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill um but we do not
 
03:20:07.830 --> 03:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
support it we think it's not needed we
 
03:20:09.910 --> 03:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
think it's costly and it's impractical
 
03:20:09.920 --> 03:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
think it's costly and it's impractical
to

03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:20:14.349 --> 03:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
implement since uh 1998 our state has
 
03:20:15.790 --> 03:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
had one of the most comprehensive
 
03:20:18.670 --> 03:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
permitting process in in the state for
 
03:20:20.030 --> 03:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
large ground withdrawal of Permitting
 
03:20:21.550 --> 03:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
processes and we've thoroughly studied
 
03:20:23.070 --> 03:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
it with the legislature there was a
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
legislative groundwater commission from
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
2003 to 2010 that looked at the rules we
 
03:20:30.630 --> 03:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
initially established after the 1998
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
legislation in May tweaks as we go put a
 
03:20:34.830 --> 03:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
lot of our rules into statutes so that
 
03:20:36.630 --> 03:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
they can't be waved and have to be you
 
03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
know strictly uh
 
03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
followed our process has proven to be
 
03:20:42.990 --> 03:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
very effective Ive for any new
 
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
groundwater large groundwater TRW since
 
03:20:46.830 --> 03:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
in the 24 years I've been there I'm not
 
03:20:49.150 --> 03:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
aware of any adversely impacted private
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
well that hasn't been mitigated at this
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
point or environmental resource there's
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
been one issue in one part of the state
 
03:20:56.750 --> 03:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
with a replacement of a grandfathered
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
well but that's not a new large
 
03:20:58.319 --> 03:20:59.670 align:start position:0%
well but that's not a new large
groundwater

03:20:59.670 --> 03:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawal this permitting process
 
03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
already takes two to three years to
 
03:21:06.429 --> 03:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
complete and it's costing entities 200
 
03:21:09.150 --> 03:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
to $300,000 in studies just to get the
 
03:21:11.590 --> 03:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
data to Dees that's required for us this
 
03:21:12.830 --> 03:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
to determine if we're going to issue a
 
03:21:14.710 --> 03:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
permit or not and the majority of these
 
03:21:16.950 --> 03:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
entities are municipalities and so
 
03:21:18.590 --> 03:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's still a fiscal impact even with
 
03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
the testing requirement because if those
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
35 out of the 40 permites um in the had
 
03:21:26.349 --> 03:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
to follow the new notification
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
requirements in the past they would be
 
03:21:29.590 --> 03:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities would be paying for this
 
03:21:32.070 --> 03:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
notification process um that's why in
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note we show it local
 
03:21:35.590 --> 03:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures as indeterminable because
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's not clear how the notification
 
03:21:37.680 --> 03:21:40.229 align:start position:0%
it's not clear how the notification
would

03:21:40.229 --> 03:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:42.910 --> 03:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
occur the state law as mentioned earlier
 
03:21:44.670 --> 03:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
already has a notification requirement
 
03:21:46.790 --> 03:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
it was established in 1998 and at first
 
03:21:48.229 --> 03:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
look you might say well that's silly
 
03:21:49.990 --> 03:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
they're referencing newspapers who does
 
03:21:51.790 --> 03:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
that anymore you know to post things in
 
03:21:53.950 --> 03:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
the newspaper who reads a printed copy
 
03:21:53.960 --> 03:21:54.710 align:start position:0%
the newspaper who reads a printed copy
of

03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
newspaper well newspapers have evolved
 
03:21:58.870 --> 03:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
and it's true very few people have a
 
03:22:00.830 --> 03:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
newspaper delivered and very few buy the
 
03:22:02.269 --> 03:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
hard copy anymore but they're now
 
03:22:03.950 --> 03:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
available digitally and they endure
 
03:22:06.110 --> 03:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
online um even after the day they're
 
03:22:08.429 --> 03:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
printed and what happens once they're
 
03:22:10.590 --> 03:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
online and we've seen this over time is
 
03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
that people gobble up the Publications
 
03:22:15.150 --> 03:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
put it on social media it goes in public
 
03:22:17.070 --> 03:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
notice listing sites it spreads like
 
03:22:19.110 --> 03:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
wildfire so if anything the newspaper
 
03:22:21.070 --> 03:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
notification even if you don't buy a
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
newspaper in your community is actually
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
more effective than it used to be as
 
03:22:26.349 --> 03:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
strange as that might sound because of
 
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:32.910 --> 03:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
technology also the notification
 
03:22:34.830 --> 03:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
requirement right now requires that you
 
03:22:36.830 --> 03:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
notify all municipalities and public
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
systems within what's called a potential
 
03:22:40.550 --> 03:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
impact area withdrawal and that's
 
03:22:42.030 --> 03:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
essentially a watershed around around a
 
03:22:43.710 --> 03:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
proposed well so you have your dot the
 
03:22:45.710 --> 03:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
well on a map you have the upgrading
 
03:22:47.229 --> 03:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
area where water's coming from to the
 
03:22:49.950 --> 03:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
well and you have the area below the dot
 
03:22:51.469 --> 03:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
on the map where water would have gone
 
03:22:53.670 --> 03:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
if it had not been extracted and so all
 
03:22:55.510 --> 03:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities and public water systems
 
03:22:57.389 --> 03:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
are notified and public water systems
 
03:22:58.910 --> 03:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
are large group of entities there just
 
03:23:02.349 --> 03:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
not large municiple water systems and at
 
03:23:04.670 --> 03:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
that point municipalities can request uh
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
request a hearing at that
 
03:23:12.269 --> 03:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
point so you know if enacted the this
 
03:23:14.349 --> 03:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
bill would require that direct
 
03:23:17.070 --> 03:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
notifications occur within a 10,500 foot
 
03:23:19.750 --> 03:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
radius we've applied that radius to our
 
03:23:21.830 --> 03:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
existing sites and we're seeing that
 
03:23:24.990 --> 03:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's causing 1500 to 3,000 Property
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
Owners to be notified because if you
 
03:23:28.469 --> 03:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
take the radius
 
03:23:31.710 --> 03:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
10,500 feet and go pi r squared and then
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
convert it to square miles that's 12 a
 
03:23:35.349 --> 03:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
half miles so it's definitely going to
 
03:23:37.189 --> 03:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
be thousands of properties that again
 
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
mostly Municipal Water Systems are going
 
03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
to have to pay to
 
03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:44.590 align:start position:0%
to have to pay to
notify

03:23:44.590 --> 03:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.469 --> 03:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
so we urge the committee to vote and
 
03:23:48.269 --> 03:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on House Bill
 
03:23:50.710 --> 03:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
1326 because we just think the process
 
03:23:53.389 --> 03:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
is working and already is robust and
 
03:23:56.189 --> 03:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
also very costly and if it does move
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
forward definitely we'll have to think
 
03:24:00.189 --> 03:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
about impacts to municipalities and
 
03:24:02.110 --> 03:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
their cost now I guess the last thing
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
I'll leave you with is the concern about
 
03:24:06.189 --> 03:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
people regionally not being notified of
 
03:24:08.750 --> 03:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
a proposed large groundwater withdrawal
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
well if we're going to say every
 
03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
Regional project that someone might have
 
03:24:13.670 --> 03:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
interest in needs to be notified if
 
03:24:15.469 --> 03:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
there's a gravel pit a new road a
 
03:24:16.710 --> 03:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
shopping center shouldn't just be a
 
03:24:18.790 --> 03:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
Butters that are notified it should be
 
03:24:20.590 --> 03:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
regionally notified it shouldn't just be
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
isolated to groundwater withdrawals
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
because our process does find who might
 
03:24:26.710 --> 03:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
be impacted after the testing is done
 
03:24:28.349 --> 03:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
homeowners are notified directly that
 
03:24:30.670 --> 03:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
you're in an area of Interest or concern
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
and so at the end of the day between the
 
03:24:33.790 --> 03:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
notification and then the follow-up
 
03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
after testing we do have it covered at
 
03:24:38.550 --> 03:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
this point as far as questions about
 
03:24:40.510 --> 03:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
applications we have staff that are
 
03:24:42.590 --> 03:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
highly responsive that respond to every
 
03:24:44.910 --> 03:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry unless someone goes on a social
 
03:24:47.189 --> 03:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
media campaign and writes a form email
 
03:24:49.269 --> 03:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
and we get 200 the same email then we
 
03:24:51.030 --> 03:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
won't reply to all of them but otherwise
 
03:24:52.550 --> 03:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
we'll have the conversation we'll reply
 
03:24:55.150 --> 03:24:55.160 align:start position:0%
to the email so the towns of local
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
levels don't have to answer the
 
03:24:58.189 --> 03:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
questions we have people who administer
 
03:24:59.750 --> 03:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
the program that will answer the
 
03:25:02.750 --> 03:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
question questions people have so i' be
 
03:25:04.870 --> 03:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank
 
03:25:08.590 --> 03:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
you representative l
 
03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
montain oh thanks for taking my question
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
can you just clarify what you just said
 
03:25:14.990 --> 03:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
as part of the permitting process or
 
03:25:18.510 --> 03:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
when the testing is done you do notify
 
03:25:20.790 --> 03:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
people impacted by the withdrawal
 
03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
already so there's two parts so there's
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
the public notification which we've
 
03:25:26.710 --> 03:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
talked about already and then there's
 
03:25:28.349 --> 03:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
two other direct notifications that
 
03:25:30.790 --> 03:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
occur as part of the permitting process
 
03:25:33.070 --> 03:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
one the applicant needs to get access to
 
03:25:35.550 --> 03:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative private Wells that are in
 
03:25:37.349 --> 03:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
the area so they can ask the monitor
 
03:25:39.269 --> 03:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
water levels while they do testing and
 
03:25:41.510 --> 03:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
so homeowners are aware at that point
 
03:25:43.309 --> 03:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
then after the testing is done we can
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
see where the potential impact area
 
03:25:46.990 --> 03:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
where the water table has been impacted
 
03:25:49.269 --> 03:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
by the withdrawal of water and as part
 
03:25:51.309 --> 03:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
of a permit people have to be directly
 
03:25:52.990 --> 03:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
notified that you're in what we call a
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
zone of influence the area where there
 
03:25:56.229 --> 03:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
might be a little depression of the
 
03:25:58.510 --> 03:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
water table and here's how you contact
 
03:26:01.229 --> 03:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
the State or the Pere if you have a
 
03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
problem with your well so you can see if
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's a water quantity issue caused by
 
03:26:07.990 --> 03:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
the large withdrawal or if it's just a a
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
sight specific well issue
 
03:26:10.399 --> 03:26:13.110 align:start position:0%
sight specific well issue
okay

03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
question from anyone else representative
 
03:26:17.710 --> 03:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:26:20.710 --> 03:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you comment on
 
03:26:23.950 --> 03:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
the number of um I understand from the
 
03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
previous um the sponsor that there's a
 
03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
few of these going on right now can you
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
comment on the number of people that are
 
03:26:31.510 --> 03:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
attending these public hearings
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
currently I believe it approaches and I
 
03:26:35.710 --> 03:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
my colleague has been at the most recent
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
hearings 100 people some of these
 
03:26:38.080 --> 03:26:39.670 align:start position:0%
hearings 100 people some of these
hearings

03:26:39.670 --> 03:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
03:26:42.590 --> 03:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
lately earlier and the early 2000s
 
03:26:45.189 --> 03:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
unless of course was USA Springs it was
 
03:26:47.710 --> 03:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
a handful of people 12 13 that would
 
03:26:50.349 --> 03:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
attend when a town requested a hearing
 
03:26:52.189 --> 03:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
but recently with the word getting out
 
03:26:56.110 --> 03:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:00.790 --> 03:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
participation or followup um I would the
 
03:27:04.189 --> 03:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
the rsas seem to be scattered littered
 
03:27:07.469 --> 03:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
with um references to Notifications by
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
in newspapers are you suggesting that
 
03:27:13.830 --> 03:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
that it's still appropriate to um to put
 
03:27:16.229 --> 03:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
the in newspapers or are you suggesting
 
03:27:19.870 --> 03:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
that digital newspapers um supplant um
 
03:27:22.670 --> 03:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
what has traditionally been um uh you
 
03:27:25.389 --> 03:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
know paper newspapers I think it's
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
combination of both some people still do
 
03:27:29.790 --> 03:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
read the local or Statewide paper and
 
03:27:32.110 --> 03:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
others access it digitally but either
 
03:27:34.950 --> 03:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
way it's like other notifications once
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
the word gets out it tends to spread
 
03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
either by word of mouth or by social
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
media post or some towns proactively and
 
03:27:43.710 --> 03:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
nothing's prohibiting a town from
 
03:27:45.630 --> 03:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
putting information on there including
 
03:27:47.710 --> 03:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
call us if you have questions instead of
 
03:27:51.389 --> 03:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
them trying to feel the questions thank
 
03:27:54.590 --> 03:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Don thank you Mr
 
03:27:57.269 --> 03:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:28:00.670 --> 03:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
um my question has is related to when
 
03:28:04.030 --> 03:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
someone has done a deep will well for
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
either a municipality or Golf Course or
 
03:28:09.550 --> 03:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
a large um um apartment complex or
 
03:28:11.429 --> 03:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
something of that nature have you seen
 
03:28:13.750 --> 03:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
or as have you seen any Town's
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
experience where neighboring houses now
 
03:28:19.710 --> 03:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
have wells that have dried up because of
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
that well being
 
03:28:23.830 --> 03:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
drilled not under our current large
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawal process um we had
 
03:28:28.630 --> 03:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
that situation occur and legislation was
 
03:28:30.550 --> 03:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
passed to address it where someone was
 
03:28:32.830 --> 03:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
replacing a grandfathered well and the
 
03:28:35.590 --> 03:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
new well did impact a neighborhood of
 
03:28:38.429 --> 03:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
wells in since in legislation's been put
 
03:28:40.269 --> 03:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
into place to allow us to address
 
03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
replacement Wells which we couldn't do
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
before um as far as our permitting
 
03:28:45.870 --> 03:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
process goes we see Wells that are
 
03:28:47.830 --> 03:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
problematic that need to be replaced
 
03:28:50.349 --> 03:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
before we can approve the withdraw so
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we've seen that scenario but we
 
03:28:53.950 --> 03:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
have not seen an area where a lot of
 
03:28:55.349 --> 03:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
Wells have been Dew watered because of
 
03:28:57.870 --> 03:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
all the work that we do ahead of time
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
and the rules specifically state if you
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
do cause the adverse impact the burden
 
03:29:03.630 --> 03:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
appr proofs on the permit under our
 
03:29:05.870 --> 03:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
oversight to investigate it and mitigate
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%

suppliers who are included in the large
 
03:29:54.070 --> 03:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawal and go through

the reporting system with
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
Dees we've had a great over the years
 
03:30:00.710 --> 03:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
Brandon and me have worked together on a
 
03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
lot of different uh legislation in large
 
03:30:06.750 --> 03:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater and I come here today in
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill because I know
 
03:30:13.150 --> 03:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
what it takes in order to get a large
 
03:30:15.950 --> 03:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater permit uh Brandon talked
 
03:30:18.710 --> 03:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
about what's necessary and then all of
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
the legal parts of you you can't impact
 
03:30:25.269 --> 03:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
other people's
 
03:30:27.550 --> 03:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
water it's great that the sponsor
 
03:30:30.510 --> 03:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
removed two of Brandon's big costing
 
03:30:33.030 --> 03:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
items in the proposed
 
03:30:36.189 --> 03:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
legislation and I am struggling with the
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph B in the
 
03:30:41.070 --> 03:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
notification first of all it is a
 
03:30:41.080 --> 03:30:43.510 align:start position:0%
notification first of all it is a
departmental

03:30:43.510 --> 03:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
departmental
 
03:30:46.590 --> 03:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
hearing that you're asking the applicant
 
03:30:50.030 --> 03:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
to tell everybody about in a big long
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
two-year process you're asking the
 
03:30:54.910 --> 03:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
applicant I first of all would like it
 
03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
to be the department that does this if
 
03:31:00.830 --> 03:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
you require some radius area the other
 
03:31:04.349 --> 03:31:04.359 align:start position:0%
item is when I brought this up to my my
 
03:31:06.429 --> 03:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
my contractors that have large
 
03:31:09.189 --> 03:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawal they were like
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
who are we notifying how are they they
 
03:31:14.110 --> 03:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
going to figure this out if it is their
 
03:31:17.070 --> 03:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility and then the liability
 
03:31:19.550 --> 03:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
question that's not really in here is if
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
I miss somebody where they don't get the
 
03:31:24.309 --> 03:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
notification are they going to come back
 
03:31:26.349 --> 03:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
and have legal action against the
 
03:31:28.590 --> 03:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
project because they felt they weren't
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
legally notified and this includes an
 
03:31:34.150 --> 03:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
awful lot of people this is so it's not
 
03:31:35.950 --> 03:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
when you look at this and it says you
 
03:31:37.550 --> 03:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
have to have a list of all persons that
 
03:31:40.110 --> 03:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
you were notified how good is the list
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
that you get
 
03:31:43.189 --> 03:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
what's the reach I don't know how I
 
03:31:45.990 --> 03:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
would do this never mind an applicant in
 
03:31:48.910 --> 03:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
an area I think the system that Brandon
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
talked about currently works we haven't
 
03:31:54.670 --> 03:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
had issues and I don't think this is
 
03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
really necessary now what I'll throw in
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
is my wisdom of attending other
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee hearings the municipal and
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
County government committee is hearing a
 
03:32:07.790 --> 03:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
lot of I work with planning boards
 
03:32:10.950 --> 03:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
owning boards all of the rest and they
 
03:32:12.910 --> 03:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
are putting enabling legislation that
 
03:32:14.750 --> 03:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to probably vote on pretty
 
03:32:16.389 --> 03:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
soon that's going through the
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
legislature that enables cities and
 
03:32:21.870 --> 03:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
towns to post on their website
 
03:32:24.750 --> 03:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
notifications I do think the marketplace
 
03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
is changing for newspapers and
 
03:32:29.590 --> 03:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
notifications I think we are moving to a
 
03:32:31.910 --> 03:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
much more electronic and they're doing a
 
03:32:34.070 --> 03:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
lot like that I really think this
 
03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
notification already goes to the town if
 
03:32:38.750 --> 03:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
they already have a website it would
 
03:32:41.189 --> 03:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
benefit them to be able to post it there
 
03:32:43.630 --> 03:32:43.640 align:start position:0%
that would make the most logical sense
 
03:32:46.110 --> 03:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
to have a page of all of those public
 
03:32:48.590 --> 03:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
not notices so I'm just putting forward
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
to that they did it as enabling because
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
not every city or town has a website
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they could do this but it may be
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
something you consider in paragraph a
 
03:33:00.429 --> 03:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
that you put in some other language
 
03:33:02.070 --> 03:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's similar to what's going into
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
other other bills this session that
 
03:33:07.189 --> 03:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
enables cities and towns to have another
 
03:33:10.510 --> 03:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
way to notify residents or those that
 
03:33:13.229 --> 03:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
are going to be impacted and I apologize
 
03:33:16.229 --> 03:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
my voice I'm kind of losing my voice but
 
03:33:18.110 --> 03:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
um that's just an idea to give the
 
03:33:21.150 --> 03:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
committee but I we looked at this
 
03:33:24.070 --> 03:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
10,500 feet when we just were like who
 
03:33:25.950 --> 03:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
were we notifying because we were
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
involved in notifications under other
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
statutes and other permits but this one
 
03:33:33.510 --> 03:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
here is more of a public noticing of a
 
03:33:36.950 --> 03:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
hearing by the department and so I just
 
03:33:38.910 --> 03:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
say it injust I know Brandon wouldn't
 
03:33:40.750 --> 03:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
like me changing that word applicant to
 
03:33:43.309 --> 03:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
the department but uh it really is the
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
Department's hearing so I would leave
 
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
that um so we really have major concerns
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
over this notification and how it would
 
03:33:55.269 --> 03:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
work thank you very much any questions
 
03:33:58.469 --> 03:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:00.830 --> 03:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you chairman just one

it they
 
03:34:08.590 --> 03:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
did that's right it was that's right and
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%

got a got a got a news a memo from a big
 
03:34:19.590 --> 03:34:19.600 align:start position:0%

03:34:21.710 --> 03:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
but I do think it's a trend and I I do
 
03:34:25.110 --> 03:34:25.120 align:start position:0%

03:56:08.910 --> 03:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
this caused water to rise over two feet
 
03:56:11.710 --> 03:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
over the bases of the lighthouses which
 
03:56:13.349 --> 03:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
by the way are the only freshwater
 
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
lighthouses in the state of New
 
03:56:17.790 --> 03:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are three of them docks
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%

03:56:30.960 --> 03:56:32.590 align:start position:0%
other Lakes throughout the state became
extremely

03:56:32.590 --> 03:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous the state was asked to
 
03:56:36.990 --> 03:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
implement a reduction in the speed that
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
boats could use during this time
 
03:56:41.910 --> 03:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol advised me that there was
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
no clear authority to impose a speed
 
03:56:46.910 --> 03:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
restriction without going through the
 
03:56:49.630 --> 03:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
rulle making process which as you know
 
03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
can be a lengthy
 
03:56:54.149 --> 03:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
process we took it upon ourselves and
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement officials with the
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
assistance of the lake ctiy protective
 
03:57:01.990 --> 03:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
Association began to inform the
 
03:57:05.189 --> 03:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
community of the need to slow down
 
03:57:07.149 --> 03:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
electronic Billboards were placed at the
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
entrances to the towns of new Newbury
 
03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
New London and ctiy save the Wake the
 
03:57:17.269 --> 03:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
lake leave no wake inform voters voters
 
03:57:19.990 --> 03:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the danger it worked and most
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
everyone using the lake heated the
 
03:57:25.149 --> 03:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
warning what we didn't have was the
 
03:57:27.149 --> 03:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
weight of the state behind this
 
03:57:30.070 --> 03:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
information campaign public service
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
announcements social media websites were
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
needed to make it a complete thorough
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
campaign this bill would give the state
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
the right to have a rule in place in an
 
03:57:45.510 --> 03:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
emergency that the speed on lake sopy
 
03:57:48.990 --> 03:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
and every other Lake would be
 
03:57:51.830 --> 03:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
reduced it is not intended to ticket
 
03:57:55.149 --> 03:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
someone exceeding the no weight limit
 
03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
but allows the state to get the message
 
03:58:00.309 --> 03:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
out that conditions are such that speed
 
03:58:02.910 --> 03:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
should be reduced without this
 
03:58:04.750 --> 03:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
legislation the commissioner of safety
 
03:58:07.229 --> 03:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
was reluctant to disseminate such a
 
03:58:12.030 --> 03:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
message so so I am asking you pass House
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 360 that will eliminate that
 
03:58:17.510 --> 03:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
reluctance to notify people of an
 
03:58:17.520 --> 03:58:18.750 align:start position:0%
reluctance to notify people of an
existing

03:58:18.750 --> 03:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
existing
 
03:58:21.389 --> 03:58:21.399 align:start position:0%
emergency and I will take any questions
 
03:58:23.149 --> 03:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
and there are many people from the lake
 
03:58:25.950 --> 03:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
here to speak about
 
03:58:28.950 --> 03:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
that have any questions from members of
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
the committee representative rung thank
 
03:58:32.990 --> 03:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative wolf for taking my
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
question I actually have two one is
 
03:58:39.870 --> 03:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
would you anticipate if this bill passes
 
03:58:41.870 --> 03:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
that the same communication tools that
 
03:58:43.790 --> 03:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
were used at sunabe would be used at
 
03:58:46.149 --> 03:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
other Lakes to get the word out my
 
03:58:47.790 --> 03:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
concern is just how do how do people
 
03:58:51.870 --> 03:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
know that um the the speed limits been
 
03:58:55.950 --> 03:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
altered well you by by notice what we
 
03:58:58.830 --> 03:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
did was we put the electronic billboard
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
signs out the protective Association put
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
it out on their website the towns the
 
03:59:07.229 --> 03:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
various towns new BR New London and Sony
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
did it um on their websites so it was
 
03:59:13.710 --> 03:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
a campaign that was cobbled together in
 
03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
about 36 hours and it became very
 
03:59:19.110 --> 03:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
effective uh but if you have the power
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the state behind you calling Channel
 
03:59:24.630 --> 03:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
9 and saying put up Public Service
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
Announcement out it would be even more
 
03:59:29.429 --> 03:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
effective yeah one more question for
 
03:59:32.950 --> 03:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
follow okay thank you um and also I I
 
03:59:34.590 --> 03:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
noticed that the the decisions being
 
03:59:36.750 --> 03:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
made by the department of safety do you
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
anticipate that they may work in
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
consultation with Dees or do you think
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
the department of safety um has the the
 
03:59:48.670 --> 03:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
ability to make any call that the
 
03:59:51.070 --> 03:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
weather might be because I I'm assuming
 
03:59:53.870 --> 03:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
that this this is really to protect the
 
03:59:56.189 --> 03:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
shoreline well it's not just to protect
 
03:59:58.149 --> 03:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
the shoreline I mean if you're out there
 
04:00:00.790 --> 04:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
boating and there's a submerged log
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a problem if you're
 
04:00:04.349 --> 04:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
going down the lake that's true when
 
04:00:06.269 --> 04:00:06.279 align:start position:0%
this happened I pulled my boat out of
 
04:00:09.309 --> 04:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
the lake for that 10day period and left
 
04:00:12.429 --> 04:00:12.439 align:start position:0%
it on shore on a trailer so it's not
 
04:00:14.710 --> 04:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
just the shoreline I know that's one of
 
04:00:20.309 --> 04:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
our dear and subjects but it's Public
 
04:00:23.950 --> 04:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
Safety so with the state doing it I left
 
04:00:25.990 --> 04:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
it just to the commissioner of safety
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
because he is over Marine Patrol and
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol is probably the one that's
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to enforce it true thank you very
 
04:00:35.040 --> 04:00:36.630 align:start position:0%
going to enforce it true thank you very
much

04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:00:39.149 --> 04:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
representative representative Barby
 
04:00:40.309 --> 04:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking oh excuse me
 
04:00:45.870 --> 04:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative I do have a a an
 
04:00:48.429 --> 04:00:48.439 align:start position:0%
amendment to this that you all have
 
04:00:51.269 --> 04:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
received in the last 24 hours that
 
04:00:55.469 --> 04:00:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
speed thank
 
04:01:00.870 --> 04:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
you representable for taking my
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
question um you I think this commun has
 
04:01:05.189 --> 04:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
heard that I'm no fan of the definition
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
of um Headway speed but I'll leave that
 
04:01:07.920 --> 04:01:09.670 align:start position:0%
of um Headway speed but I'll leave that
aside

04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
aside
 
04:01:14.229 --> 04:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
um the um uh I I previously testified um
 
04:01:18.429 --> 04:01:18.439 align:start position:0%
about a similar incident um where uh you
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
know on the lake where my Camp is um
 
04:01:23.229 --> 04:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
where a boat actually floated off a dock
 
04:01:25.269 --> 04:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
and I went around the lake to try to
 
04:01:26.910 --> 04:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
find the owner of it and I did go at
 
04:01:30.269 --> 04:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
Headway speed so I appreciate it um very
 
04:01:35.149 --> 04:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
much what I'm wondering is if um the I'm
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
not familiar with this section of the
 
04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
statue I tried to scan it as we went
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
through it but um this is pretty like
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
you can set the speedway that you can
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
spit set the speed limit to Headway
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
speed but um would the uh is from your
 
04:01:51.389 --> 04:01:51.399 align:start position:0%
information would the um Department of
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
Safety be able to set rules such that
 
04:01:55.910 --> 04:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
for example they could go above Headway
 
04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
speed if they needed to for an emergency
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
situation if they and still enforce it
 
04:02:05.910 --> 04:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
uses I don't know the answer to that
 
04:02:11.149 --> 04:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
question uh one of the reasons that it
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
was changed uh to a no wake zone is
 
04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's very visible you can look out
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
there you don't need a radar gun to know
 
04:02:26.189 --> 04:02:26.199 align:start position:0%
that they're exceeding a no wake so I
 
04:02:27.950 --> 04:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what the uh Department of
 
04:02:30.429 --> 04:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
Safety could do in the rest of it now
 
04:02:32.830 --> 04:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
they do have the ability through rule
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
making to have reduced speeds when you
 
04:02:37.830 --> 04:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
go into the harbor when you're in a
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
certain Coes and things of that sort so
 
04:02:45.469 --> 04:02:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
that any other questions by uh members
 
04:02:52.349 --> 04:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:54.670 --> 04:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
committee did you want have additional
 
04:02:56.830 --> 04:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
thing to say I just saw it's just a
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
question when I should uh offer the
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
amendment uh why don't you offer it now
 
04:03:06.030 --> 04:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:11.469 --> 04:03:11.479 align:start position:0%
uh okay I would like to amend hb1
 
04:03:14.309 --> 04:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
1360 with Amendment
 
04:03:14.319 --> 04:03:17.229 align:start position:0%
1360 with Amendment
2024

04:03:17.229 --> 04:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
2024
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
0492 which reads um
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
amend the article that the commissioner
 
04:03:25.469 --> 04:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Safety May
 
04:03:28.229 --> 04:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
establish a Safety and Security Zone
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
comma including the establishment of a
 
04:03:34.030 --> 04:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
no wake zone for a period not to exceed
 
04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
10 days due to weather or environmental
 
04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
conditions on any public or Coastal
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
Waters of the state in the case of an
 
04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
action the basically the the your would
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
remove uh establishment of maximum speed
 
04:04:00.189 --> 04:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
limit that's correct to a
 
04:04:04.349 --> 04:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
establishment of a no W no Z
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
okay when I gave it to OLS that's what
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
came back so
 
04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
okay I could have made it simple like
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
did is there any other questions uh on
 
04:04:24.429 --> 04:04:24.439 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
B repres representative I don't know if
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
this is something a question is a
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
suggestion whether in environmental
 
04:04:34.630 --> 04:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
conditions I would rather see severe put
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
in front of that or something along that
 
04:04:36.960 --> 04:04:39.030 align:start position:0%
in front of that or something along that
line

04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to change it any way that's
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
going to get it past because weather a
 
04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
big heavy
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
rainstorm that's what I really you know
 
04:04:50.030 --> 04:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
I I TR thought about trying to Define
 
04:04:52.670 --> 04:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
what it is we could have a major
 
04:04:55.229 --> 04:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
Windstorm come through where the next
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
day it's clear and all of these trees
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
fall into the lake so it becomes unsafe
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
you have a a condition as we had this
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
summer where it took a few days for the
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
lake level to come up so
 
04:05:10.990 --> 04:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
follow up that's why you said that that
 
04:05:12.630 --> 04:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
would be a severe case that's what I
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I would just say
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
rather just weather
 
04:05:19.389 --> 04:05:19.399 align:start position:0%
conditions just a
 
04:05:22.149 --> 04:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion any other
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh any other members of the committee
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
have questions or
 
04:05:31.710 --> 04:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
comments um I have a comment Mr
 
04:05:34.149 --> 04:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
chair um I just want to say thank you
 
04:05:37.229 --> 04:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward I think it's a
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
really good bill and it's going to help
 
04:05:47.590 --> 04:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
comment say no further questions thank
 
04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.990 --> 04:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
see uh Elizabeth Harper the lake cipy
 
04:06:01.680 --> 04:06:06.790 align:start position:0%
see uh Elizabeth Harper the lake cipy
protective

04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%

04:06:13.110 --> 04:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:14.830 --> 04:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
yes my name is Elizabeth Harper I'm the
 
04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
executive director of the lake cipy
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
protective Association um and we're here
 
04:06:22.429 --> 04:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
1360 over this past summer lake centi
 
04:06:27.630 --> 04:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
saw water levels that were higher than
 
04:06:30.269 --> 04:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
anyone on the lake remembers uh there
 
04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
was extensive damage to shorelines docks
 
04:06:35.950 --> 04:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
boat ramps and our iconic Lake sopy
 
04:06:37.950 --> 04:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
lighthouses that you'll see in the the
 
04:06:39.950 --> 04:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
photos that are being passed around
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
right now um the damage was made
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
infinitely worse by waves that were
 
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
created by boats that were traveling at
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
high speeds um and creating wakes that
 
04:06:51.790 --> 04:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
were damaging
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
shorelines uh and including areas where
 
04:06:55.630 --> 04:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
there were septic systems that was
 
04:06:58.149 --> 04:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
another issue that we heard a lot of
 
04:07:01.030 --> 04:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
concerns from homeowners about um were
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
failing septic systems during this time
 
04:07:06.189 --> 04:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
uh we receiv received dozens of calls
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
and emails from uh property owners that
 
04:07:12.030 --> 04:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
were concerned about safety risks about
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
water quality issues um and about
 
04:07:17.469 --> 04:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
property damage and they wanted to know
 
04:07:19.870 --> 04:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
what they could do um they assumed that
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
local uh Town Police could do something
 
04:07:25.349 --> 04:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
but they don't have the authority um and
 
04:07:27.109 --> 04:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
so we fed it a lot of questions about
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
who had the authority to take
 
04:07:32.189 --> 04:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
action um we requested that no aake
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
orders be implemented by the Department
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services and Department
 
04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
of Safety uh but there was never a
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
coordinated and effective state level
 
04:07:44.269 --> 04:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
response um to this emergency um and
 
04:07:46.429 --> 04:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of I think frustration
 
04:07:48.790 --> 04:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
that that response never came and a lot
 
04:07:50.349 --> 04:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
of it really was around the uncertainty
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
about who had the authority um and so
 
04:07:53.950 --> 04:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we're really asking for
 
04:07:55.469 --> 04:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
today is that
 
04:07:59.030 --> 04:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
Clarity um we did you know have a a
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
great Grassroots local effort um with
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
our local legislators Town officials and
 
04:08:06.109 --> 04:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
property owners and business owners to
 
04:08:09.870 --> 04:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
implement our voluntary wake pledge um
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
and this was largely successful but it
 
04:08:13.870 --> 04:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
was difficult because we didn't we
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have any Authority um and there
 
04:08:17.950 --> 04:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
were some people that uh weren't weren't
 
04:08:20.830 --> 04:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
interested in in following um those
 
04:08:23.389 --> 04:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations a lot of people did um
 
04:08:25.630 --> 04:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
but I think that they would be um much
 
04:08:29.149 --> 04:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
more likely to take the right actions if
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
the state level Authority was there and
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
especially um from the Department of
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
Safety um you know there are
 
04:08:38.670 --> 04:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
environmental issues and de
 
04:08:40.670 --> 04:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
could potentially weigh in as well but I
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
think if you have two agencies that both
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
have the ability to make the call um
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for that decision to be
 
04:08:49.149 --> 04:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
made quickly about who's going to take
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
action so having it be the authority of
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
one agency I think would be preferable
 
04:08:57.550 --> 04:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're here um in support
 
04:08:59.550 --> 04:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
04:09:02.109 --> 04:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
1360 um and I would agree with the
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
amended language uh that calls for a no
 
04:09:08.429 --> 04:09:08.439 align:start position:0%
wake zone um rather than a speed
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
limit and I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:09:14.070 --> 04:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
questions about our experience with this
 
04:09:16.349 --> 04:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
any question representative
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
Don thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do you see that
 
04:09:24.429 --> 04:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
there might be more expansive um reasons
 
04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
for having the department of safety uh
 
04:09:29.670 --> 04:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
establish more than just this type of
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
announcement maybe a CYO bacteria Bloom
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
are there other things that you would as
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
a Lake Association like to see this
 
04:09:38.830 --> 04:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
expanded into besides just the
 
04:09:38.840 --> 04:09:40.389 align:start position:0%
expanded into besides just the
singularity

04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
singularity
 
04:09:43.149 --> 04:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
issue I think for this particular Bill
 
04:09:45.550 --> 04:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
staying focused on this makes sense we
 
04:09:47.149 --> 04:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
fortunately have some some other bills
 
04:09:48.950 --> 04:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
that are coming through the house that
 
04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
are more focused on the
 
04:09:53.550 --> 04:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria issue and some of the
 
04:09:55.389 --> 04:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
other issues that need to be dealt with
 
04:09:56.990 --> 04:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I think it might muddy the waters a
 
04:09:59.830 --> 04:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
bit to try to roll that into this but I
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
do think it's yeah not no pun intended
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
um but um but but I do think you know
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
for people who are concerned about the
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
science bacteria issue this this is
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
right in line with this allows us a
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
rapid response um that will reduce the
 
04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
damage that can be done to sh lines that
 
04:10:18.910 --> 04:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
will result in issues with cyanobacteria
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
so it is beneficial but I don't know
 
04:10:22.429 --> 04:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
that that language needs to be
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
bill any other question
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so like s
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
a big lake um my Lake's a little Lake um
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
if I imagine that um if uh you put in an
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
awake Zone across the whole lake it's
 
04:10:47.349 --> 04:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
going to take a long time to get from
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
end to end would that basically just
 
04:10:50.670 --> 04:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
shut down boating traffic
 
04:10:52.990 --> 04:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
altogether no I it doesn't need to shut
 
04:10:55.109 --> 04:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
it down it would just it would slow it
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
down the majority of people aren't going
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
from one end to the other um and just an
 
04:11:02.149 --> 04:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
answer not to go up topic too much but
 
04:11:03.269 --> 04:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
someone asked a question about the
 
04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
department of safety and you know would
 
04:11:07.710 --> 04:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
they be able to um travel at speed that
 
04:11:09.670 --> 04:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
were faster and actually our local
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety officer during this
 
04:11:14.750 --> 04:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
time made the point of following the
 
04:11:17.149 --> 04:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
noake orders that we suggested and was
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
in close contact with us and he valued
 
04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that we did that and was
 
04:11:23.469 --> 04:11:23.479 align:start position:0%
wanting to support those efforts and he
 
04:11:25.750 --> 04:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
was willing to go at um you know at
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
those lower speeds during that time um
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
but also we made sure that we kind of
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
rescinded those recommendations kind of
 
04:11:36.670 --> 04:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
within that 10day period um so that it
 
04:11:40.830 --> 04:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
expectation any other questions by
 
04:11:44.550 --> 04:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
04:11:47.389 --> 04:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:54.510 --> 04:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
you Andrea
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:05.790 --> 04:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
Lakes good afternoon chair Wen Zulu and
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh thank you
 
04:12:10.269 --> 04:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to speak I'm Andrea
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
Laro the president of New Hampshire
 
04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
lakes and we are here to speak in
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and in support as
 
04:12:19.309 --> 04:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
the bill has um the
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
amendment and uh just building upon what
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative wolf and M Miss Harper
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
have already said because I know you
 
04:12:28.510 --> 04:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
guys have had a long day I tuned in this
 
04:12:30.870 --> 04:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
morning to your session um so I won't
 
04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
repeat necessarily but just to add that
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes um Statewide as you
 
04:12:39.469 --> 04:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
know we represent about 275 local Lake
 
04:12:43.389 --> 04:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
Associations and the flooding last year
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
um was caused similar issues in in many
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
lakes throughout the state um including
 
04:12:52.590 --> 04:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh the big lake lake uh Lake win basaki
 
04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite as as high as cipe but even
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
there they issued a voluntary no
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
wake as a Statewide organization as soon
 
04:13:04.750 --> 04:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
as the this issue started happening last
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
summer we put out um a survey to let
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
people um tell us um across the state
 
04:13:13.630 --> 04:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
what was happening and we received about
 
04:13:16.189 --> 04:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
750 folks from around the state letting
 
04:13:18.910 --> 04:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
us know that the high water and lack of
 
04:13:21.030 --> 04:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
a coordinated Statewide response to
 
04:13:23.710 --> 04:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
address it was causing safety issues it
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
was causing shoreline erosion issues um
 
04:13:28.830 --> 04:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
because Boats were still out there some
 
04:13:30.590 --> 04:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
Boats were still out there you know
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
going at um high speeds and in making
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
wakes so all across the state we heard
 
04:13:37.109 --> 04:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
about shoreline erosion property
 
04:13:40.109 --> 04:13:40.119 align:start position:0%
property damage uh big wakes coming in
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
and submerging uh Shoreline septic
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
systems and causing uh water quality
 
04:13:47.469 --> 04:13:47.479 align:start position:0%
concerns um so I just wanted to add
 
04:13:49.469 --> 04:13:49.479 align:start position:0%
today that this is a Statewide problem
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
and I also wanted to add that
 
04:13:54.109 --> 04:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we can expect these
 
04:13:55.830 --> 04:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events to continue in
 
04:13:58.830 --> 04:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
the future so um I expect that we'll see
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
more of the more of this high water more
 
04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
frequently and to put in a place put in
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
a system in place that's uh more
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
streamlined and more CLE clear as to who
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
has the authority uh to issu an
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
emergency no wake I think would be
 
04:14:15.389 --> 04:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh to uh the state of New
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our water bodies for a
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
number of reasons so with that I thank
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
you for your consideration and I'm happy
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by anybody

thank you Miss Lumber not taking my
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
question um in your letter you're
 
04:14:37.590 --> 04:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
supporting the um emergency maximum
 
04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
speed limit I'm assuming you're
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
supportive of the amendment well I I
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if I missed out yes thank you
 
04:14:45.870 --> 04:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
for clarifying yes the amendment as well
 
04:14:47.469 --> 04:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:14:50.109 --> 04:14:50.119 align:start position:0%

04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
1360 my home was on the eastern shore of
 
04:15:28.710 --> 04:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
Lake snipe the extraordinarily high
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
waters um experience last year damaged
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
my seasonal wooden dock desite despite
 
04:15:38.590 --> 04:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
me taking preventative measures such as
 
04:15:41.630 --> 04:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
weighing down the dock panels with 5
 
04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
gallon pales of water I frequently
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
observe boats uh speeding past my
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
property generating waves that further
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
aggravated the damage it was as if
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
voters didn't care I was hopeful that
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would issue an emergency
 
04:16:04.590 --> 04:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
orders to prevent watercraft from
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
traveling at more than Headway speed
 
04:16:11.309 --> 04:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
but that did not happen it is my
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that it was unclear which
 
04:16:13.600 --> 04:16:14.389 align:start position:0%
understanding that it was unclear which
New

04:16:14.389 --> 04:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh agency had the authority uh
 
04:16:22.109 --> 04:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
to issue such an emergency order my work
 
04:16:24.389 --> 04:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
experience is taught me that if multiple
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
people or organizations are in charge
 
04:16:31.469 --> 04:16:31.479 align:start position:0%
then no one is in charge this bill
 
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the authority would lie
 
04:16:35.710 --> 04:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Safety and I
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
would hope that would be the Marine
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
Patrol although I hope that we never
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
have to experience a repeat of last
 
04:16:47.349 --> 04:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
year's extraordinarily high water it is
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
becoming abundantly clear that weather
 
04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
anomalies are becoming more and more
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
prevalent we need this legislation in
 
04:16:57.389 --> 04:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
place for the
 
04:17:02.910 --> 04:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
season any questions by members of the
 
04:17:05.800 --> 04:17:09.750 align:start position:0%
season any questions by members of the
committee

04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
much James

04:17:35.670 --> 04:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
London thank you chair and
 
04:17:38.189 --> 04:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
representatives um I'm James Dexter I
 
04:17:40.349 --> 04:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
live in New London I also own a cottage
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
in h
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
Bradford um the the lake in Bradford is
 
04:17:48.189 --> 04:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
Lake mum and it has a very unique
 
04:17:49.990 --> 04:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
Watershed I don't know if any of you are
 
04:17:51.710 --> 04:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with that Lake but um when you
 
04:17:54.429 --> 04:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
get heavy rain the very very flat
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
outflow from the lake turns into an
 
04:17:59.910 --> 04:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
inflow so it can be very easy after a
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
heavy rain for us to get two or three
 
04:18:04.750 --> 04:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
feet of rays in the lake in overnight
 
04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
for example so when 2021 happened to be
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
July just like last year we experienced
 
04:18:12.990 --> 04:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
about a six- foot rise which of course
 
04:18:15.309 --> 04:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
put the town beach underwater it put the
 
04:18:18.109 --> 04:18:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh the campground Beach underwater and a
 
04:18:20.670 --> 04:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
lot of the shoreline underwater this is
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
more than what people are kind of
 
04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
prepared for three or four feet most of
 
04:18:27.389 --> 04:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
the people on the shorelines have shored
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
it up so we can handle that kind of
 
04:18:31.790 --> 04:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
tidal movement so to speak but in July
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
of 2023 we experienced an 8ot rise and
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
it took less than 3 days after that
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
heavy rain came before it went up and
 
04:18:40.109 --> 04:18:40.119 align:start position:0%
then it was about a week before it
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
settled down um that rise not only put
 
04:18:46.349 --> 04:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
two roads underwater it put the
 
04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
shoreline underwater obviously
 
04:18:51.389 --> 04:18:51.399 align:start position:0%
everybody's docks were six feet 7 feet 8
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
feet underwater um but it put 10 of the
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
lowest cottages on the lake they they
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
got their feet wet so to speak only a
 
04:19:01.109 --> 04:19:01.119 align:start position:0%
couple of them had water on the floor
 
04:19:02.710 --> 04:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
but many of them the bottom of the
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
building was in the Water Mine included
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
one one clapboard on the bottom of the
 
04:19:08.830 --> 04:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
house was underwater so we the flooor
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
was about 6 in above so the only thing
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
we could do at the time was the lake mum
 
04:19:18.269 --> 04:19:18.279 align:start position:0%
Improvement Association asked for a
 
04:19:21.309 --> 04:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
voluntary no wake which the majority of
 
04:19:22.870 --> 04:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
the people who lived on the lake
 
04:19:26.109 --> 04:19:26.119 align:start position:0%
observed that and and did it um
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately the boat launch was
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
ineffectual because the boat launch
 
04:19:31.630 --> 04:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
comes up Steep and then it's really flat
 
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
so the water was so high couldn't really
 
04:19:35.469 --> 04:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
launch a boat very well so we didn't
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
have very many visitors but there were a
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
few people who ignored the request and
 
04:19:43.269 --> 04:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
would move along the lake enough to make
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
a big wave so those waves I know many
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
people that experienced a wave come
 
04:19:51.790 --> 04:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
across and wash into their Cottage the
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
waves took the stairs out at the public
 
04:19:57.630 --> 04:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
beach for example um so I'm in support
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the bill I'm in support of the
 
04:20:01.510 --> 04:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative wolf just
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
described and um do you have any
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions be be glad to take them
 
04:20:10.269 --> 04:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you Mr chair
 
04:20:13.109 --> 04:20:13.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
um there's almost a thousand well over a
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
thousand depending on how you count them
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
um public water bodies in New Hampshire
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
um I I wouldn't imagine that department
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
of safety would be able to individually
 
04:20:28.590 --> 04:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
go to each of those and say I guess
 
04:20:30.550 --> 04:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to need a a speed limit here
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
or not so what um for your Lake um which
 
04:20:35.590 --> 04:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
I've been to I think I think I almost
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
bought a camp there um
 
04:20:41.710 --> 04:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
the um how would you imagine um uh the
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
process working so that they were
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
informed that there was a serious
 
04:20:49.149 --> 04:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
problem um um Marine Patrol does come to
 
04:20:51.389 --> 04:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
the late periodically they're not as as
 
04:20:52.830 --> 04:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
there as often as they are on the big
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
lakes but they are there so my my
 
04:20:57.790 --> 04:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
impression would be the the association
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
or potentially a resident would reach
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
out to the Marine Patrol and say hey
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
we've just experienced X would you
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
consider this an emergency situation
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
under this ruling and then let them
 
04:21:11.070 --> 04:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
decide perfect that would be how I would
 
04:21:13.710 --> 04:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
picture it thank
 
04:21:16.590 --> 04:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
you any other questions by members of
 
04:21:16.600 --> 04:21:18.590 align:start position:0%

04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
cards having no
 
04:21:34.030 --> 04:21:34.040 align:start position:0%

04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
yours good afternoon Mr chair and
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee for
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Nancy Murphy representing
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
the town of marac Hillsboro County
 
04:55:36.070 --> 04:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
District 12 I'm here today to introduce
 
04:55:40.070 --> 04:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
HB 1415 relative to pfest facility
 
04:55:42.430 --> 04:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
liability as you are likely aware my
 
04:55:44.350 --> 04:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
community has had the unfortunate
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
distinction of being the site of the
 
04:55:48.190 --> 04:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
largest environmental industrial
 
04:55:50.430 --> 04:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
disaster in New Hampshire's history due
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
to the Past contamination of our Town's
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
air water and soil by St Co
 
04:55:58.270 --> 04:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
Bain we also have had the distinction of
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
having to pay many tens of millions of
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
dollars out of pocket and that number
 
04:56:05.190 --> 04:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
may actually be an underestimation to
 
04:56:06.750 --> 04:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
try to protect ourselves from the
 
04:56:08.830 --> 04:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
consequences of that
 
04:56:10.990 --> 04:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
contamination in addition to our public
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
Wells many private wells in marimac and
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities have been conf
 
04:56:17.070 --> 04:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
contaminated by pasas as
 
04:56:19.548 --> 04:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
well citizens across New Hampshire have
 
04:56:21.628 --> 04:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
learned that pasas have been found to be
 
04:56:23.548 --> 04:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
present at different levels in their own
 
04:56:26.150 --> 04:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
communities we now know that pooa one of
 
04:56:28.510 --> 04:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
the 15,000 or more of these toxic
 
04:56:30.270 --> 04:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals has been proven to cause
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer there is a growing list of
 
04:56:34.350 --> 04:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
many other Health harms known to be
 
04:56:37.070 --> 04:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
associated with exposure to these toxic
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
bioc cumulative chemicals that have such
 
04:56:42.270 --> 04:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
concerning biodegradation
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
properties there is no question that
 
04:56:47.910 --> 04:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
pasas are bad news really bad news our
 
04:56:50.310 --> 04:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
exposure to these dangerous chemicals
 
04:56:52.670 --> 04:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
isn't going to stop until those
 
04:56:54.548 --> 04:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
responsible for the contamination of our
 
04:56:58.110 --> 04:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
communities are motivated to find safer
 
04:57:00.350 --> 04:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
Alternatives as they are making profits
 
04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
that keep their shareholders happy and
 
04:57:03.788 --> 04:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
they've never beeny held fully
 
04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
accountable for the environmental and
 
04:57:07.948 --> 04:57:07.958 align:start position:0%
public health harms they create
 
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
polluters don't have a reason to do that
 
04:57:13.868 --> 04:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
the rest of us New Hampshire citizens
 
04:57:15.670 --> 04:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
who have found ourselves the unwitting
 
04:57:17.948 --> 04:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
victims of corporate greed and laws that
 
04:57:20.230 --> 04:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
protect the perpetrators of harm rather
 
04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
than the victims of it are paying the
 
04:57:24.510 --> 04:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
price and that is
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
wrong polluters have paid Advocates to
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
be present here to fight for their
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
protections while citizens must rely on
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
us their elected representatives
 
04:57:35.390 --> 04:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
there is no question that New Hampshire
 
04:57:37.590 --> 04:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
should be and needs to be business
 
04:57:40.110 --> 04:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
friendly but there's no advantage to the

are able to take advantage of the many

business benefits New Hampshire has to
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
offer while at the same time they
 
04:57:51.910 --> 04:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
destroy our environment and harm our

citizens New Hampshire doesn't need

businesses that come here to reap profit

04:58:05.708 --> 04:58:05.718 align:start position:0%
to attract businesses that are proud of
 
04:58:07.990 --> 04:58:08.000 align:start position:0%

facility buildings and structures when
 
04:59:18.390 --> 04:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
past polluters make the decision to shut
 
04:59:21.070 --> 04:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
down operator operations and leave the
 
04:59:23.830 --> 04:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
facility in which they've done business
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
we must ensure that they be held
 
04:59:28.030 --> 04:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for the removal of their

past materials and waste as well under
 
04:59:35.190 --> 04:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
the terms of this legislation hb1 1415
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
will appropriately Place responsibility
 
04:59:38.590 --> 04:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
where it is
 
04:59:41.270 --> 04:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
due hopefully as New Hampshire continues
 
04:59:44.590 --> 04:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
to address the ramifications of PS of
 
04:59:46.750 --> 04:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
the PS contamination here this will be
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
another step toward decreasing our
 
04:59:51.750 --> 04:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
exposure to past while at the same time
 
04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
providing a bit of motivation for
 
04:59:56.110 --> 04:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
polluters to seek safer chemical
 
04:59:58.230 --> 04:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and engage in safer
 
05:00:01.110 --> 05:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
production practices the responsibility
 
05:00:03.310 --> 05:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
and cost for cleaning up their mess
 
05:00:05.070 --> 05:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
should not be left to the communities
 
05:00:06.270 --> 05:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
they've already
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
harmed it is time for those that cause
 
05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to have expensive problems
 
05:00:14.548 --> 05:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
to pay for them and passing hb1 1415
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
would be a step in the right direction
 
05:00:19.510 --> 05:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens are T are tired
 
05:00:22.150 --> 05:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
of paying to try to protect ourselves
 
05:00:23.948 --> 05:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
from business and production practices
 
05:00:26.948 --> 05:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
that harm us practices that lack respect
 
05:00:28.590 --> 05:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
for our beautiful state and those of us
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
living in it we have the ability to show
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
those who elected us to represent their
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
Collective best interest that their
 
05:00:37.390 --> 05:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
voices have been heard and that the New
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature is going to
 
05:00:41.390 --> 05:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
prioritize the protection of our
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
resources wildlife and the health and
 
05:00:46.590 --> 05:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
well-being of our citizens over the
 
05:00:48.788 --> 05:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
profits of the pest polluters who harm
 
05:00:50.990 --> 05:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
us I thank you for your attention and
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
consideration of this bill that's
 
05:00:54.628 --> 05:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
important both in terms of environmental
 
05:00:56.590 --> 05:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
and public health protections and an
 
05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
accountability for past facilities that
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
release past into our groundwater or
 
05:01:05.350 --> 05:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
surface water in excess of our PS aqs um
 
05:01:06.670 --> 05:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing that I would
 
05:01:10.030 --> 05:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
like to to mention is um a question was
 
05:01:11.350 --> 05:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
raised this morning in a prior bill that
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
I think is very relevant here and um I
 
05:01:15.628 --> 05:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
think it might have been uh
 
05:01:18.390 --> 05:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative Derby who asked uh when
 
05:01:20.430 --> 05:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a commission the the
 
05:01:22.830 --> 05:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
extending a commission what can we do to
 
05:01:25.230 --> 05:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
address P impacts in other communities
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
that maybe aren't part of the HB 737
 
05:01:31.628 --> 05:01:31.638 align:start position:0%
commission we can stop that those
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
communities from being further impacted
 
05:01:37.230 --> 05:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
by by um corporations that are doing
 
05:01:39.150 --> 05:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
this in their communities so that's this
 
05:01:41.628 --> 05:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
is just one step and and and doesn't
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
address the commission issue but it
 
05:01:45.708 --> 05:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
certainly addresses the contamination um
 
05:01:48.190 --> 05:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
and uh that's all I have and I know Dees
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
is here um and is ready to address any
 
05:01:52.270 --> 05:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
of the questions regarding the the
 
05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
statute St thank
 
05:01:57.868 --> 05:01:57.878 align:start position:0%

the bill forward and taking my question
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the very top where you
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
have the
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
definitions and um just in general these
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
are the definitions that are also in the
 
05:02:21.190 --> 05:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
statute on pasas is that correct that's
 
05:02:22.708 --> 05:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
correct thank

representative Elber thank you Mr
 
05:02:31.390 --> 05:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm playing devil's advocate
 
05:02:33.868 --> 05:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
here I want to be clear that I do not
 
05:02:36.310 --> 05:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
that I support this and I'm bringing
 
05:02:39.708 --> 05:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
this up wearing a Ways and Means
 
05:02:43.230 --> 05:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
Committee Member had has there been any
 
05:02:46.990 --> 05:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
research done on the amount of money
 
05:02:51.190 --> 05:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
that uh St gobain brought into the state
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
in the way of business taxes or any
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
other kinds of support in comparison to
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that communities and
 
05:03:03.230 --> 05:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
the state will have to pay
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
to clean up the mess oh thank you for
 
05:03:06.080 --> 05:03:06.788 align:start position:0%
to clean up the mess oh thank you for
your

05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
question in my opinion no amount of
 
05:03:12.868 --> 05:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
money that any polluter could bring into
 
05:03:16.948 --> 05:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
this state would be worth the effects
 
05:03:19.390 --> 05:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
and the Fallout of they're having done
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
business here so I don't know specifics
 
05:03:23.670 --> 05:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
about how much I know the you know in
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
particular SEO Bain they there maybe a
 
05:03:28.190 --> 05:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
couple hundred employees I think it's
 
05:03:29.628 --> 05:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
not a huge
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
facility and you know they there are
 
05:03:33.510 --> 05:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
there are certainly benefits to
 
05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
employees that you know they convenient
 
05:03:39.708 --> 05:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
for home they have health insurance but
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
um I'll leave it there followup or
 
05:03:44.788 --> 05:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
followup I completely agree with you I'm
 
05:03:47.628 --> 05:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
just wondering if part of a
 
05:03:51.270 --> 05:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
defense from the business or businesses
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
you it has thank you for your question
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
it has been our experience in marac that
 
05:04:01.600 --> 05:04:03.548 align:start position:0%
it has been our experience in marac that
um

05:04:03.548 --> 05:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:06.350 --> 05:04:06.360 align:start position:0%

05:04:09.868 --> 05:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
made publicly but um I would say that
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
that has not been our
 
05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
experience thank you any other questions

05:04:28.270 --> 05:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
expenses um that I'm missing when I talk
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
about the burden that um citizens have
 
05:04:34.510 --> 05:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
had I know um people have had to pay
 
05:04:36.830 --> 05:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to put in their own
 
05:04:39.150 --> 05:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
filtration system they have to pay to
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
maintain it and replace the
 
05:04:45.310 --> 05:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
filters um they have loss of enjoyment
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
of many parts of their property because
 
05:04:50.548 --> 05:04:50.558 align:start position:0%
they're they have uh they have to have
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
bottled water delivery um they've got
 
05:04:55.830 --> 05:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
the waste of the bottled water delivery
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
when they get sick they have to go to
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
the doctor if they have insurance they
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
have a co-pay or a deductible they have
 
05:05:04.910 --> 05:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
medic ation they have to pay for if they
 
05:05:06.990 --> 05:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
get sick they've got hospitalization
 
05:05:09.948 --> 05:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
costs loss of work loss of companionship
 
05:05:12.670 --> 05:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
with their family um can you think of
 
05:05:15.868 --> 05:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
any other expenses that have been borne
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
by the public because of the pollution
 
05:05:22.628 --> 05:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
and the contamination caused by S Cain
 
05:05:24.670 --> 05:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
that I've missed thank you for your
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
question one right off the top of my
 
05:05:29.430 --> 05:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
head beyond the individual cost to to
 
05:05:31.708 --> 05:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
families uh many of whom even though
 
05:05:32.548 --> 05:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
there were there were some some
 
05:05:34.548 --> 05:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
reimbursement opportunities for rebate
 
05:05:37.390 --> 05:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
programs some were not eligible for them
 
05:05:39.750 --> 05:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
because years ago when we recognized the
 
05:05:41.788 --> 05:05:41.798 align:start position:0%
problem we put filtration systems in
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
before it was acknowledged as an issue
 
05:05:46.670 --> 05:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh by the state um so those people are
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
not reimbursed um and as you said
 
05:05:50.910 --> 05:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
suggested U maintenance one of the the
 
05:05:54.430 --> 05:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
things in our town is the two um public
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
Wells Wells four and five were the most
 
05:05:59.910 --> 05:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
contaminated Wells um and our water
 
05:06:03.750 --> 05:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
system in marac um although the water is
 
05:06:05.510 --> 05:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
mixed as it travels through the system
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
depending upon where you live on in town
 
05:06:09.628 --> 05:06:09.638 align:start position:0%
and how close you are to those
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
particular Wells and how close you are
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
to S gobain um there's a a a correlation
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
between the level of P exposure you
 
05:06:19.948 --> 05:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
you've had and I happen to live at two
 
05:06:22.590 --> 05:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
miles from St gobain closest to the
 
05:06:24.310 --> 05:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
Wells that are the most contaminated and
 
05:06:26.070 --> 05:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
they were shut down and part of the
 
05:06:30.670 --> 05:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
negotiation with um St gobain that
 
05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately no there was no citizen
 
05:06:36.390 --> 05:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
input at any point ever um regarding
 
05:06:38.590 --> 05:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
what agreements were made between our
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
state agencies and um St gobain but we
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
are the ones responsible for for um
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
following up on those and dealing with
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
them but um there's a fiveyear operating
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
and maintenance agreement on the the the
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
filtration for those two most impacted
 
05:06:58.430 --> 05:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
Wells the rest of the wells um although
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
they're all contaminated um have not yet
 
05:07:03.150 --> 05:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
at least been checked chosen to be
 
05:07:06.190 --> 05:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
linked to St Goan so those we know that
 
05:07:11.150 --> 05:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
P are forever substances and a 5ye
 
05:07:14.270 --> 05:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
operating and maintenance agreement on a
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
filtration system that will need to run
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity um so who's going to pay
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
for that so we do we pay for that um
 
05:07:25.230 --> 05:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
there there are there are so many things
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
in you know in the in the our schools
 
05:07:29.230 --> 05:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
the we had to originally we had to pay
 
05:07:30.750 --> 05:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
for the water to be filtered there
 
05:07:34.548 --> 05:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
because um sban would not agree to that
 
05:07:36.868 --> 05:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
um there you know the health cost I mean
 
05:07:38.670 --> 05:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
what is the you know we we New Hampshire
 
05:07:40.830 --> 05:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
has been number one in the nation for
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
Pediatric cancer breast cancer bladder
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
cancer and esophageal cancer what's the
 
05:07:47.310 --> 05:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
value of a human life you know when
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
you're the you're a single parent and
 
05:07:51.270 --> 05:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
you're a mom and you're sick who takes
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
care of your kids how do you how do you
 
05:07:56.230 --> 05:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
quantify that so it's a huge problem and
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's why it's so hard for me when I
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
hear those who are um you know come to
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
test y on behalf of polluters and I I
 
05:08:08.310 --> 05:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
think we have such a there's something
 
05:08:12.830 --> 05:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
wrong when those that are doing the harm
 
05:08:14.948 --> 05:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
have the benefit of that
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
representation and we who are the
 
05:08:19.470 --> 05:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
victims and speaking for the victims
 
05:08:22.110 --> 05:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
here to represent the victims um don't
 
05:08:24.750 --> 05:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
seem to have the same ability to to make
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
change so I'm hoping that um this is a
 
05:08:31.470 --> 05:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
start that we when when there is
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
motivation to um to change practices
 
05:08:37.548 --> 05:08:37.558 align:start position:0%
when it's going to be a little costly
 
05:08:39.628 --> 05:08:39.638 align:start position:0%
and a little inconvenient and profits go
 
05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
down a little bit um that that will be
 
05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
motivation to change which will benefit
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
all of us so my do sense thank
 
05:08:53.310 --> 05:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
you uh I'm just looking at the bill the
 
05:08:59.910 --> 05:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill itself yes I I see it
 
05:09:03.750 --> 05:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
I I mean what I see in this onepage bill
 
05:09:03.760 --> 05:09:04.670 align:start position:0%
I I mean what I see in this onepage bill
is

05:09:04.670 --> 05:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
basically clean up after yourself that's
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
it that's what that's what it's saying
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
but so everything I'm but I'm I'm
 
05:09:17.590 --> 05:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
hearing a much greater thing in the te
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the questioning and the concern is I
 
05:09:23.310 --> 05:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
want to stick to what is actually in the
 
05:09:28.910 --> 05:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill now the there is that first part in
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh where it says in eight that says you
 
05:09:35.910 --> 05:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
you're subject to uh provisions of
 
05:09:39.390 --> 05:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
federal regulations in 40 CFR and it
 
05:09:42.150 --> 05:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
gives it gives it that information it
 
05:09:45.270 --> 05:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't say what that is uh so I'm not
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
certain what it is where I the bill is
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
asked maybe that'll come out in the
 
05:09:56.670 --> 05:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
discussion with uh uh with Dees but uh I
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I've been hearing in the in
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
the questions all about the other human
 
05:10:05.470 --> 05:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
factors and things like that but is that
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily the part of the bill that
 
05:10:09.628 --> 05:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
we're that's before
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
us thank you for your question you're
 
05:10:14.350 --> 05:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
100% right this is a if you make a mess
 
05:10:16.230 --> 05:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
clean it up okay and don't leave us to
 
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
pay for the and and actually I think
 
05:10:20.590 --> 05:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
I've included in those little packets
 
05:10:22.350 --> 05:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
the federal the little blurb from the
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
federal uh law it's they're in those
 
05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
little packets but Dees will be I'm sure
 
05:10:31.708 --> 05:10:31.718 align:start position:0%
far more okay knowledgeable about that
 
05:10:33.628 --> 05:10:33.638 align:start position:0%
one more there's a question from
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative a question thank you Mr
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
chair and it's not a question I just
 
05:10:39.270 --> 05:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
another thing I'd like to make a
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that a any any person
 
05:10:43.270 --> 05:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
please put in any person business
 
05:10:46.350 --> 05:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
Corporation 14
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
line yeah
 
05:10:54.910 --> 05:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
14 I just tie it to a
 
05:10:58.230 --> 05:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
person business company
 
05:11:00.910 --> 05:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
Corporation thank you I'll I'll defer to
 
05:11:03.628 --> 05:11:03.638 align:start position:0%
Dees and I'm sure there's a rationale
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
for for that language but thank
 
05:11:09.628 --> 05:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
you seeing no more questions from
 
05:11:11.110 --> 05:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:18.270 --> 05:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
question um in the North Country there
 
05:11:20.628 --> 05:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
is a landfill in Bethlehem and I believe
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
another one that Cassel is trying to put
 
05:11:26.590 --> 05:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
in um I have a that I get a distinct
 
05:11:29.788 --> 05:11:29.798 align:start position:0%
impression there are past chemicals
 
05:11:29.798 --> 05:11:30.948 align:start position:0%
impression there are past chemicals
coming

05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
coming
 
05:11:30.958 --> 05:11:32.590 align:start position:0%
coming
from

05:11:32.590 --> 05:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
coming uh on cassella trucks into those
 
05:11:39.430 --> 05:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
sites and I as I understand I think the
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
Ander Andrew scogin is already polluted
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
with them is this does this bill extend
 
05:11:48.350 --> 05:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
to the people that take those poisons
 
05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
and bring them someplace else and dump
 
05:11:53.510 --> 05:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
them I mean who's is that cassel's
 
05:11:55.830 --> 05:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
problem or is that St go Bain's
 
05:11:59.110 --> 05:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
problem I I think this this bill is
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
limited in scope and uh pertains
 
05:12:07.070 --> 05:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
primarily to um PFS facilities that
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
contaminate with with that exceedence of
 
05:12:14.310 --> 05:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
agq um so I would again defer to Dees um
 
05:12:15.948 --> 05:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm not familiar with all of the
 
05:12:17.350 --> 05:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
federal regulations and I'm sure they
 
05:12:19.150 --> 05:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
have a bit of sense that I do I don't
 
05:12:20.670 --> 05:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
misrepresent thank you thank
 
05:12:27.910 --> 05:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
you seeing no one else other questions
 
05:12:31.110 --> 05:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Wendy
 
05:12:31.120 --> 05:12:40.350 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Wendy

05:12:40.350 --> 05:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:42.990 --> 05:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
two times in one
 
05:12:48.030 --> 05:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
blessed I am representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:12:52.590 --> 05:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
and I represent the town of mar Mack
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro uh District number 12
 
05:12:59.548 --> 05:12:59.558 align:start position:0%
um to get to answer your question first
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
of all look at what we've done for you
 
05:13:05.110 --> 05:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a good question um
 
05:13:07.310 --> 05:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
because it implies that we're we're not
 
05:13:10.670 --> 05:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
grateful that this company is is in our
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
um in our state I'm going to tell you
 
05:13:16.510 --> 05:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
what they've done for us um some of the
 
05:13:18.270 --> 05:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
costs have been already mentioned but
 
05:13:19.708 --> 05:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go
 
05:13:22.628 --> 05:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
through the personal costs of living in
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
a town that is contaminated with pest we
 
05:13:27.868 --> 05:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
had to put in a whole house filtration
 
05:13:31.350 --> 05:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
system that was $4,000 with installation
 
05:13:33.310 --> 05:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
we had to to put in a reverse osmosis
 
05:13:36.190 --> 05:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
filtration system that was $11,000 with
 
05:13:38.990 --> 05:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh installation to maintain the filters
 
05:13:42.030 --> 05:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
on these filtration systems it's $500 a
 
05:13:45.670 --> 05:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
year for the LA and we cannot we're not
 
05:13:48.030 --> 05:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
guaranteed that these filters are
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
getting all of the chemicals because s
 
05:13:52.510 --> 05:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
Goan is not giving us a full list of the
 
05:13:55.030 --> 05:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
chemicals um the last time the Smoke
 
05:13:57.750 --> 05:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
Stacks were analyzed I think there were
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
like 180 chemicals that were not listed
 
05:14:03.070 --> 05:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
remember p chemicals there's more than
 
05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
14,000 of these chemicals we regulate
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
four four which means that all of those
 
05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
other ones are you know they're in the
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
wild um we live on bottled water because
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
we can't trust our filtration system for
 
05:14:22.230 --> 05:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
the past four years every month at the
 
05:14:25.868 --> 05:14:25.878 align:start position:0%
cost of St Cain who will not admit uh
 
05:14:28.270 --> 05:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
that that they're who will not admit
 
05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
fault we get approximately 164 gallons
 
05:14:35.030 --> 05:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
delivered to our house these are in
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
crates that are put in our driveway we
 
05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
have to pick them up and get them into
 
05:14:41.670 --> 05:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
our house my husband's had cardiac
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
surgery I've had cancer surgery we
 
05:14:47.270 --> 05:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
cannot physically pick up these these
 
05:14:49.788 --> 05:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
packages anymore they're they've got six
 
05:14:51.750 --> 05:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
gallons in them a gallon is about 5
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
pounds um so they're very very heavy I
 
05:14:56.750 --> 05:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
think it's a gallon is more than 5
 
05:15:01.590 --> 05:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
pounds but anyway um and there is an En
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
environmental impact we have 700
 
05:15:06.868 --> 05:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
families in our town living on bottled
 
05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
water just think of the plastic that
 
05:15:12.910 --> 05:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
we're ingesting so we're we're trading
 
05:15:15.430 --> 05:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
one devil for another one and our
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
recycling center in town is being
 
05:15:20.750 --> 05:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with all of this plastic I I
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
have to go every every single weekend if
 
05:15:24.830 --> 05:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes I have to go more just to
 
05:15:27.868 --> 05:15:27.878 align:start position:0%
get rid of the plastic um health care
 
05:15:30.430 --> 05:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
costs um as I've mentioned before we
 
05:15:32.230 --> 05:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
have cardiac issues in in my house we've
 
05:15:35.470 --> 05:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
got cancer we've had surgeries we've had
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
um we have to do monitoring once you've
 
05:15:41.110 --> 05:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
had a a chronic severe Health uh problem
 
05:15:43.070 --> 05:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
you you have to be monitored more often
 
05:15:44.590 --> 05:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
you got to take time off to do that
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
you've got prescriptions you've got
 
05:15:48.910 --> 05:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy um let's talk about our
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
small animals and the impact to them I
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
recently put down my fourth dog because
 
05:15:57.548 --> 05:15:57.558 align:start position:0%
of cancer um and cancer is a byproduct
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
of drinking obviously our little dogs
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
are the canaries in the coal mine
 
05:16:03.948 --> 05:16:03.958 align:start position:0%
and you talk to people in marac all of
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
our pets are dying they're all sick so
 
05:16:07.548 --> 05:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
you've got vet bills you've got
 
05:16:11.230 --> 05:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
euthanasia bills um we'll talk about the
 
05:16:16.750 --> 05:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
emotional impact um I know now without a
 
05:16:19.948 --> 05:16:19.958 align:start position:0%
doubt that my cancer is caused by Pest
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
and and the oncologist up at Dartmouth
 
05:16:25.948 --> 05:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock up in Lebanon agrees with that
 
05:16:28.350 --> 05:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
this is the same water that I drank that
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
my kids drank I also breastfed all of my
 
05:16:33.788 --> 05:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
my kids and when you breastfeed and
 
05:16:37.708 --> 05:16:37.718 align:start position:0%
you're you're exposed to P it it gathers
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
in the fat tissue and breast milk is
 
05:16:41.830 --> 05:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
very fatty and and you're you're
 
05:16:46.510 --> 05:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
actually giving your baby more um past
 
05:16:49.548 --> 05:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
than you that so I I thought I was doing
 
05:16:51.548 --> 05:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
the right thing for my kids I was I was
 
05:16:53.788 --> 05:16:53.798 align:start position:0%
killing them I was killing my children
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
because I decided to breastfeed them in
 
05:16:59.948 --> 05:16:59.958 align:start position:0%
this town now let's talk about the town
 
05:17:03.910 --> 05:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
costs we we paid to filter our Public
 
05:17:06.910 --> 05:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
School water because they contaminated
 
05:17:10.350 --> 05:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
it we paid for that we paid with the
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
town voted on a warrant article we paid
 
05:17:13.320 --> 05:17:15.030 align:start position:0%
town voted on a warrant article we paid
$14

05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
$14
 
05:17:17.868 --> 05:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
million all of our water rates went up
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
to filter our public water because they
 
05:17:24.270 --> 05:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
contaminated it we didn't do this we
 
05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
have increased School costs because of
 
05:17:30.910 --> 05:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities special ed it is p
 
05:17:33.868 --> 05:17:33.878 align:start position:0%
exposure when a mother is pregnant is
 
05:17:36.190 --> 05:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
linked to learning
 
05:17:40.030 --> 05:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities um our town constantly has
 
05:17:42.110 --> 05:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against St gobain because they
 
05:17:45.390 --> 05:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
were trying to get them into to to
 
05:17:48.548 --> 05:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
comply um that's a cost that's that's
 
05:17:50.590 --> 05:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's shared well put on the shoulders
 
05:17:51.548 --> 05:17:51.558 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:17:54.070 --> 05:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um
 
05:17:55.830 --> 05:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
so you
 
05:17:58.670 --> 05:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
know these are all sort of auxiliary
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
costs that that result because of this
 
05:18:03.670 --> 05:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
but SI and I'm going to use CCO ban
 
05:18:05.070 --> 05:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
because this is what really we're
 
05:18:08.270 --> 05:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
talking about but any company that that
 
05:18:11.430 --> 05:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
does not care about the community they
 
05:18:13.310 --> 05:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
they're in and that poisons that
 
05:18:16.190 --> 05:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
Community should be the ones to clean it
 
05:18:19.150 --> 05:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
up not one penny of New Hampshire
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers should go to cleaning up this
 
05:18:24.110 --> 05:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
mess they made it they're a French
 
05:18:25.510 --> 05:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
headquartered company they're a
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar company they need
 
05:18:29.708 --> 05:18:29.718 align:start position:0%
to clean it
 
05:18:32.970 --> 05:18:32.980 align:start position:0%
up there you go that's it any
 
05:18:32.980 --> 05:18:36.708 align:start position:0%
up there you go that's it any
[Laughter]

05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:39.548 --> 05:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
questions representative R thank you Mr
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
05:18:43.788 --> 05:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
Thomas for taking my question um you
 
05:18:45.990 --> 05:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
describe very accurately the cost that
 
05:18:49.110 --> 05:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
has been borne by marac residents but
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't the state incur cost too with
 
05:18:56.350 --> 05:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
the added work put on Dees and other oh
 
05:18:59.150 --> 05:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
yeah no this is a this I mean marac is
 
05:19:01.510 --> 05:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
the poster child for past contamination
 
05:19:04.708 --> 05:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
but this is a state
 
05:19:04.718 --> 05:19:07.910 align:start position:0%
but this is a state
problem

05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative this may seem like it's
 
05:19:11.948 --> 05:19:11.958 align:start position:0%
coming out of nowhere thank you
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative um for taking my
 
05:19:18.628 --> 05:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
question um so I have a little bit of a
 
05:19:20.750 --> 05:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge deficit or maybe it's just a
 
05:19:25.030 --> 05:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
memory deficit about the kind of um
 
05:19:27.670 --> 05:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
things that people in the consent
 
05:19:27.680 --> 05:19:29.310 align:start position:0%
things that people in the consent
decreed

05:19:29.310 --> 05:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
decreed
 
05:19:32.230 --> 05:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
area have in terms of of a response from
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
St gobain could you tell us a little
 
05:19:36.070 --> 05:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
more about the consent degree and what
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the terms of that are um Dees would
 
05:19:42.110 --> 05:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
would have the more more specifics but I
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
know that the consent decree was signed
 
05:19:49.230 --> 05:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
when we had no idea how dangerous past
 
05:19:52.430 --> 05:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
chemicals were it was signed with um U
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
marac Town uh Village District water MVD
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and it was signed before we knew the
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
actual extent so orig orally the state
 
05:20:04.670 --> 05:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
told us that only the houses that lived
 
05:20:06.868 --> 05:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
within a half mile of s gobain needed to
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
be concerned because it was contained
 
05:20:10.708 --> 05:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
then they did some testing and they're
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
like oh our bad it's really a a mile
 
05:20:17.708 --> 05:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
around s Cain um so I live three miles
 
05:20:20.150 --> 05:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
from s Cain had my private well tested
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
and it was so contaminated we had to we
 
05:20:25.230 --> 05:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
had to shut it down three miles away and
 
05:20:27.788 --> 05:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
it's gone even further so this consent
 
05:20:30.190 --> 05:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
decree was was established before we
 
05:20:32.548 --> 05:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
knew that that the Pas was traveling
 
05:20:34.830 --> 05:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
with water you know there's there's a
 
05:20:37.590 --> 05:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
river right right by St gobain Pas
 
05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't care about town boundaries it's
 
05:20:41.830 --> 05:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to Mar it's going to nashaa it's
 
05:20:44.830 --> 05:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's already in nashaa um it's before we
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
understood uh how the extent of of the
 
05:20:51.990 --> 05:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
particulates in air from their burning
 
05:20:54.110 --> 05:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
every night you know Wind Blows it
 
05:20:56.270 --> 05:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't care about boundaries it's going
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
all over Southern New Hampshire so the
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
consentire is something that that that
 
05:21:03.750 --> 05:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
we've challenged and we need to
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
challenge again because s Cain knew that
 
05:21:09.670 --> 05:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
this was a bad situation they knew this
 
05:21:11.708 --> 05:21:11.718 align:start position:0%
was poison they knew that these
 
05:21:13.830 --> 05:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
chemicals were harmful to human health
 
05:21:15.548 --> 05:21:15.558 align:start position:0%
and they they they lied to us
 
05:21:17.190 --> 05:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
essentially they did it's not
 
05:21:18.910 --> 05:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
essentially they lied to us they knew
 
05:21:21.548 --> 05:21:21.558 align:start position:0%
they pulled one over our heads and um as
 
05:21:24.190 --> 05:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
was mentioned by uh representative rung
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
the the um the consent decree says
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll filter our water for 5
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
years now remember these are forever
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
chemicals they're not going away 5 years
 
05:21:35.910 --> 05:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're still going to have a problem okay
 
05:21:38.788 --> 05:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
I have a follow or a
 
05:21:41.708 --> 05:21:41.718 align:start position:0%
followup so there are zones of
 
05:21:48.430 --> 05:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:51.070 --> 05:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
established it certainly feels that way
 
05:21:54.910 --> 05:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
um say um Dees is doing private well
 
05:21:58.628 --> 05:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
testing um so so they're slowly sort of
 
05:22:02.110 --> 05:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
um identifying Wells that are
 
05:22:02.120 --> 05:22:03.628 align:start position:0%
um identifying Wells that are
contaminated

05:22:03.628 --> 05:22:03.638 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
05:22:06.910 --> 05:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know I
 
05:22:10.350 --> 05:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
would I would say that they're arbitrary
 
05:22:13.510 --> 05:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
um but that's just my personal opinion I
 
05:22:17.548 --> 05:22:17.558 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to well based on the
 
05:22:19.670 --> 05:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
maps and everything and based that that
 
05:22:21.788 --> 05:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
wind blows and water flows I would say
 
05:22:23.430 --> 05:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
they're arbitrary
 
05:22:26.110 --> 05:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
yes any other
 
05:22:26.120 --> 05:22:28.990 align:start position:0%
yes any other
questions

05:22:28.990 --> 05:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:22:34.110 --> 05:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative with what you've said and
 
05:22:40.430 --> 05:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
the growth in the findings in the
 
05:22:43.708 --> 05:22:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:46.548 --> 05:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
this I guess I have to be negative do
 
05:22:49.510 --> 05:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
you think you can ever eliminate the
 
05:22:54.150 --> 05:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
problem in maram and now nashille and
 
05:22:56.470 --> 05:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
all we do not currently have the
 
05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
technology to eliminate the problem it's
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
it's in our soil it's in our water it's
 
05:23:05.548 --> 05:23:05.558 align:start position:0%
in um every night they burn and so the
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
particulate matter comes down on our
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
town the rain drives it into the ground
 
05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
that's how it gets into our water supply
 
05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
um but our produce uptakes it so we have
 
05:23:18.830 --> 05:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
we have this chemical in our Tomatoes we
 
05:23:20.990 --> 05:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
have this chemical in our apples you
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
know they we do not have the technology
 
05:23:27.548 --> 05:23:27.558 align:start position:0%
to to break these bonds outside of a
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
laboratory so the best thing we can do
 
05:23:32.430 --> 05:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
is to protect protect ourselves you know
 
05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
everyone filter your water um in in the
 
05:23:38.110 --> 05:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
really contaminated areas i' I've spoken
 
05:23:40.548 --> 05:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
with um scientists and they say if your
 
05:23:43.708 --> 05:23:43.718 align:start position:0%
dog goes outside wipe their paws off
 
05:23:45.390 --> 05:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
before they come in the house because
 
05:23:48.310 --> 05:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're carrying pest soot on their on
 
05:23:52.590 --> 05:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
their paws it's it's it's big it's big
 
05:23:55.070 --> 05:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
and it's not going away anytime soon but
 
05:23:57.390 --> 05:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
why is it our responsibility to pay for
 
05:23:57.400 --> 05:23:59.788 align:start position:0%
why is it our responsibility to pay for
this

05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:03.788 --> 05:24:03.798 align:start position:0%
cleanup you have
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
Vil I have one more question and that's
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
um do you know of circumstances where
 
05:24:19.310 --> 05:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
the same polluter came into a state and
 
05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
took more responsibility than they're
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
taking here oh yes Sinco Bain is a
 
05:24:26.350 --> 05:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
serial killer um they've done this in
 
05:24:29.190 --> 05:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
the state of Vermont Bennington um
 
05:24:32.270 --> 05:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont kicked them out they went to New
 
05:24:35.030 --> 05:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
York State HK Falls did the exact same
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
thing contaminated the town tons of
 
05:24:40.510 --> 05:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
cancer out there tons of health issues
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
um and they came to New Hampshire
 
05:24:46.230 --> 05:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
repeating this Behavior because you know
 
05:24:48.270 --> 05:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Live Free or Die you know
 
05:24:49.990 --> 05:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
we they knew they could get away with
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
this um and they did they did except for
 
05:24:55.590 --> 05:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
I mean there's a couple of us that are
 
05:24:58.510 --> 05:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
trying really really hard to hold them
 
05:25:00.110 --> 05:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
accountable because it's the right thing
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:05.788 --> 05:25:05.798 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'm not going to
 
05:25:07.628 --> 05:25:07.638 align:start position:0%
entertain any more questions I think
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
I've let it let
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
this uh discussion can go a little bit
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of the bill but I think
 
05:25:18.190 --> 05:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's good to do that now we now thank
 
05:25:22.390 --> 05:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
you uh but right now let's hear
 
05:25:22.400 --> 05:25:26.150 align:start position:0%
you uh but right now let's hear
from

05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh from D let's hear from De I I go
 
05:25:34.548 --> 05:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
maybe my eyes are my eyes are
 
05:25:39.150 --> 05:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
old could you uh identify yourselves or
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
handwriting good afternoon
 
05:25:47.470 --> 05:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative um chairman Rulo and
 
05:25:49.548 --> 05:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'm Sarah uas Kar and I serve as the
 
05:25:54.430 --> 05:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the waste
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
management division at the New Hampshire
 
05:25:58.708 --> 05:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
with me is my colleague Scott Drew and
 
05:26:04.110 --> 05:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
he's a hydrogeologist in our hazardous
 
05:26:05.948 --> 05:26:05.958 align:start position:0%
waste remediation
 
05:26:08.788 --> 05:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
Bureau we appreciate the opportunity to
 
05:26:12.350 --> 05:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
be here with you today and express de's
 
05:26:15.270 --> 05:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
support for House Bill
 
05:26:19.470 --> 05:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
1415 in recognition of the prevalence of
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
past in New Hampshire's environment and
 
05:26:26.230 --> 05:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
understanding the large amount of
 
05:26:28.990 --> 05:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
resources that the state has devoted to
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
investigating the extent of past
 
05:26:35.548 --> 05:26:35.558 align:start position:0%
contamination and mitigating past
 
05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
contamination also understanding that
 
05:26:42.350 --> 05:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
very small levels of pasas remaining in
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
piping on equipment on structures can
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
contribute to pasas in the environment
 
05:26:50.990 --> 05:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
and thereby contribute to human
 
05:26:54.590 --> 05:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
exposures to pasas We believe that this
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill is useful because it
 
05:26:59.910 --> 05:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
clarifies that uh those facilities that
 
05:27:03.190 --> 05:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
generate and use pasas and cause
 
05:27:06.150 --> 05:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
contamination must properly
 
05:27:08.788 --> 05:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
decontaminate and decommission their
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
equipment their structures their tanks
 
05:27:11.120 --> 05:27:11.868 align:start position:0%
equipment their structures their tanks
their

05:27:11.868 --> 05:27:11.878 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:27:14.030 --> 05:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
facilities before they can close as
 
05:27:14.040 --> 05:27:14.788 align:start position:0%
facilities before they can close as
they're

05:27:14.788 --> 05:27:14.798 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:27:17.390 --> 05:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
closing which will reduce the
 
05:27:20.230 --> 05:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
possibility for additional releases of
 
05:27:23.070 --> 05:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
pasas from their
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
facilities I would be happy to answer
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
questions that you have I know there are
 
05:27:32.548 --> 05:27:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
ing well actually I uh I want to ask a
 
05:27:36.480 --> 05:27:38.470 align:start position:0%
ing well actually I uh I want to ask a
question

05:27:38.470 --> 05:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:27:41.830 --> 05:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
first uh B
 
05:27:45.670 --> 05:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
basically what what teeth does this bill
 
05:27:51.070 --> 05:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
give you when dealing with people uh you
 
05:27:54.910 --> 05:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
know dealing with those who use past
 
05:27:54.920 --> 05:27:56.230 align:start position:0%
know dealing with those who use past
create

05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:27:59.110 --> 05:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
past uh and
 
05:28:03.470 --> 05:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
also there there isn't you we we we are
 
05:28:06.628 --> 05:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
we test for four P fests maybe maybe
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe five maybe six later but
 
05:28:12.470 --> 05:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
there are more than just that it's in
 
05:28:16.590 --> 05:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
it's in everything so what is the scope
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
that you're actually looking at with
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
this bill as far as telling people to
 
05:28:24.628 --> 05:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
clean it up sure if it's okay I'll start
 
05:28:26.430 --> 05:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
with the second part of your question
 
05:28:29.868 --> 05:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
first this bill refers to facilities
 
05:28:32.310 --> 05:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
that have cost caused contamination of
 
05:28:35.150 --> 05:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
the four Ps compounds that we have
 
05:28:39.070 --> 05:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
standards for um exceeding 100 parts per
 
05:28:41.830 --> 05:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
trillion so it's limited to those four
 
05:28:45.990 --> 05:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
that you referred to um and yes there
 
05:28:49.548 --> 05:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
are past compounds um a multitude of
 
05:28:53.230 --> 05:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
them that do not yet have
 
05:28:55.948 --> 05:28:55.958 align:start position:0%
standards uh in answer to the first part
 
05:28:58.670 --> 05:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
of your question what does this bill do
 
05:29:03.030 --> 05:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
for us like you said it requires that
 
05:29:05.350 --> 05:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
people who cause a mess clean it up
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
before they go away and uh it references
 
05:29:12.030 --> 05:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
the federal statute for hazardous waste
 
05:29:14.708 --> 05:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
facilities which requires hazardous
 
05:29:18.788 --> 05:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
waste facilities to um decontaminate and
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
decommission their equipment before they
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
can close I know Scott you were reading
 
05:29:25.628 --> 05:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
that that Federal requirement this
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
morning do you have anything to add
 
05:29:27.120 --> 05:29:28.548 align:start position:0%
morning do you have anything to add
about

05:29:28.548 --> 05:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:29:31.788 --> 05:29:31.798 align:start position:0%
that um just that uh just reiterating
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
that it's it's for a p facility and and
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
their closure process and their
 
05:29:40.628 --> 05:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
decontamination process you know upon or
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
during closure um it lays out the
 
05:29:46.190 --> 05:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for for taking care of
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
cleaning out those facilities and
 
05:29:52.110 --> 05:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
disposing of of that um
 
05:29:52.120 --> 05:29:55.310 align:start position:0%
disposing of of that um
material

05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
thanks actually I'll recognize
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative wolf first because uh I
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
jumped in front of him you have every
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
right to do that Mr chairman
 
05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
um in regard to what the two
 
05:30:12.310 --> 05:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives that came before you
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
said and you're talking about four past
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
compounds but
 
05:30:25.750 --> 05:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:28.110 --> 05:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
compounds does this
 
05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
bill eliminate or give you does this
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:44.470 --> 05:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
have if that that P the compound better
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I would just um respond to that
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for the question
 
05:30:51.110 --> 05:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
that it it it does focus on the four
 
05:30:53.470 --> 05:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
pfast compounds for which we have
 
05:30:55.470 --> 05:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
ambient groundwater quality standards
 
05:30:55.480 --> 05:30:56.350 align:start position:0%
ambient groundwater quality standards
and

05:30:56.350 --> 05:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:30:59.788 --> 05:30:59.798 align:start position:0%
mcls um there's reasons why we have
 
05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
regular atory criteria for those four
 
05:31:03.548 --> 05:31:03.558 align:start position:0%
compounds they're they're commonly
 
05:31:06.030 --> 05:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
detected perhaps most commonly detected
 
05:31:08.190 --> 05:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
in the environment and then when a
 
05:31:10.190 --> 05:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
facility is going to go through this
 
05:31:12.670 --> 05:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
decommissioning and cleaning up process
 
05:31:15.430 --> 05:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
of of their piping and their tanks um
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
and other aspects the the interior and
 
05:31:20.310 --> 05:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
exterior walls of those facilities um
 
05:31:22.470 --> 05:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
they were required to do that when
 
05:31:24.190 --> 05:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
there's been a documented release of
 
05:31:27.868 --> 05:31:27.878 align:start position:0%
those four pfast compounds combined um
 
05:31:30.150 --> 05:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
over 100 parts per trillion but when
 
05:31:31.750 --> 05:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
when they're going through that cleaning
 
05:31:33.910 --> 05:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
process um they're going to be cleaning
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
out a facility for for p and in reality
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
when they're they're cleaning that
 
05:31:41.708 --> 05:31:41.718 align:start position:0%
facility they they would be capturing
 
05:31:44.070 --> 05:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
the P that has been used and and
 
05:31:46.270 --> 05:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
released from that facility so the
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
cleaning process wouldn't necessarily
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
just be focused on pfoa and the other
 
05:31:53.230 --> 05:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
three compounds is to clean up you know
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
the past that were used in that facility
 
05:31:57.190 --> 05:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
and that got on the walls or were stored
 
05:31:59.830 --> 05:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the tanks um generally that's that
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
would be a formulation of of multiple
 
05:32:04.390 --> 05:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
pasas and the effort would be to clean
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:12.868 --> 05:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:15.948 --> 05:32:15.958 align:start position:0%
you you're saying now these people have
 
05:32:18.110 --> 05:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
to clean it up when they clean it up
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
what do they do with
 
05:32:22.110 --> 05:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
it I mean what where are you going to
 
05:32:24.110 --> 05:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
put it because I get the impress they're
 
05:32:25.310 --> 05:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
bringing a lot of that stuff up in
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
Northern Hampshire and dumping
 
05:32:31.230 --> 05:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
it they need to dispose of it properly
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
and how do you do that if it's water I
 
05:32:36.430 --> 05:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
mean I I maybe ask you an impossible
 
05:32:40.070 --> 05:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry yeah you got to go
 
05:32:42.750 --> 05:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
through questions questions one at a
 
05:32:45.990 --> 05:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
time come through me sorry
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
okay they would need to dispose of it
 
05:32:51.708 --> 05:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
properly and uh yes there are landfills
 
05:32:55.150 --> 05:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
that um will accept this type of waste
 
05:32:57.788 --> 05:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
uh when you refer to landfills in
 
05:33:00.350 --> 05:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire they have um um
 
05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
leate collection systems which uh
 
05:33:06.430 --> 05:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
collect the Mater the the liquid
 
05:33:09.390 --> 05:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
generated from the waste and that is
 
05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:15.670 --> 05:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
treated any more questions yes may I
 
05:33:19.390 --> 05:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
have it yep shipped off like to space I
 
05:33:20.830 --> 05:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
mean what you what are we going to do
 
05:33:22.990 --> 05:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
with all this stuff even if we do
 
05:33:23.000 --> 05:33:24.190 align:start position:0%
with all this stuff even if we do
capture

05:33:24.190 --> 05:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
capture
 
05:33:29.470 --> 05:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
it you are identifying um an issue that
 
05:33:31.110 --> 05:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
is per invasive in New Hampshire which
 
05:33:33.150 --> 05:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
is that there's pasas in so many
 
05:33:36.750 --> 05:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
products pasas in so many types of waste
 
05:33:42.190 --> 05:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
P being generated in many ways and
 
05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
um dealing with all of those sources of
 
05:33:51.270 --> 05:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
P um is um a burden for the
 
05:33:55.070 --> 05:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
state there are other bills um that that
 
05:33:57.788 --> 05:33:57.798 align:start position:0%
we're aware of that also would reduce
 
05:34:00.270 --> 05:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
work to reduce pasas in the waist stream
 
05:34:04.030 --> 05:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
but um this is a big problem that um
 
05:34:05.708 --> 05:34:05.718 align:start position:0%
that I know Dees is working on and I
 
05:34:09.310 --> 05:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:15.750 --> 05:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:18.628 --> 05:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
representative and and who else do I see
 
05:34:18.638 --> 05:34:19.708 align:start position:0%
representative and and who else do I see
other

05:34:19.708 --> 05:34:19.718 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:34:22.990 --> 05:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
hands well wait a minute while I finish
 
05:34:25.390 --> 05:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
writing all these
 
05:34:25.400 --> 05:34:28.430 align:start position:0%
writing all these
down

05:34:28.430 --> 05:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you Mr
 
05:34:33.230 --> 05:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question in Practical
 
05:34:38.670 --> 05:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
terms um actually have two questions in
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
Practical terms slean is planning to
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
shut down this year so if this and this
 
05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
bill takes effect 60 days after passage
 
05:34:50.750 --> 05:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
if it makes it to the governor's desk so
 
05:34:54.990 --> 05:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
would any of this apply to S go Bain um
 
05:34:57.150 --> 05:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
and and the second part of my question
 
05:35:00.628 --> 05:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
is how is the state going to monitor
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
these activities to make sure that there
 
05:35:05.910 --> 05:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
is compliance what what's de's role
 
05:35:08.590 --> 05:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
specific role in the decommissioning of
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:16.430 --> 05:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
facility as far as the question of how
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
would this bill if it passes uh affect S
 
05:35:23.548 --> 05:35:23.558 align:start position:0%
San's closure we would need to discuss
 
05:35:25.548 --> 05:35:25.558 align:start position:0%
that with the Department of Justice
 
05:35:27.390 --> 05:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
however I can say that we are currently
 
05:35:29.628 --> 05:35:29.638 align:start position:0%
working with s gobain to make sure that
 
05:35:32.110 --> 05:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
the the facilities properly Decon
 
05:35:35.150 --> 05:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
decontaminated and decommissioned so
 
05:35:37.270 --> 05:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're monitoring that and working
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
now okay representative donelly followed
 
05:35:45.910 --> 05:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
by representative L montin followed by
 
05:35:45.920 --> 05:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
by representative L montin followed by
representative

05:35:47.030 --> 05:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:35:50.230 --> 05:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
Darby anyone else want to get in
 
05:35:52.510 --> 05:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
line thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:35:54.190 --> 05:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'd actually like to
 
05:35:56.030 --> 05:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
go back to what representative hey
 
05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
talked about specifically in this uh
 
05:36:00.350 --> 05:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
Bill how in line for
 
05:36:03.150 --> 05:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
it says any persons and I know s b is
 
05:36:04.990 --> 05:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
not owned by a person it's owned by a
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
corporation um is there any would there
 
05:36:10.590 --> 05:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
be legal action where they could
 
05:36:12.110 --> 05:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
circumvent everything they're doing
 
05:36:15.868 --> 05:36:15.878 align:start position:0%
because it's not a person not it's a
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
company that's listed and could this
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
could this be a loophole for them I'm
 
05:36:23.230 --> 05:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
not a an attorney I am a
 
05:36:26.590 --> 05:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
geologist and it seems to me that
 
05:36:28.430 --> 05:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
looking at that language considering the
 
05:36:31.110 --> 05:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
language that was suggested to expand
 
05:36:35.750 --> 05:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:35.760 --> 05:36:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
idea

05:36:37.670 --> 05:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:36:39.868 --> 05:36:39.878 align:start position:0%
representative L montain followed by
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative Dar thank you and well
 
05:36:44.190 --> 05:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
for um taking my question reading this
 
05:36:50.590 --> 05:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
over again is clear that we're going to
 
05:36:53.948 --> 05:36:53.958 align:start position:0%
ask them to clean up their site and all
 
05:36:53.958 --> 05:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
ask them to clean up their site and all
their

05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:36:58.510 --> 05:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
equipment but what about the rest of the
 
05:37:02.548 --> 05:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
town and liability for how might we
 
05:37:04.990 --> 05:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
tackle trying to clean
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
up the the water the soil beyond their
 
05:37:12.070 --> 05:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
particular property the contamination
 
05:37:14.548 --> 05:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
elsewhere right
 
05:37:18.270 --> 05:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
yeah there the
 
05:37:21.190 --> 05:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
um set of rules EnV
 
05:37:24.548 --> 05:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
o600 pertains to cleaning up contamin
 
05:37:24.558 --> 05:37:25.750 align:start position:0%
o600 pertains to cleaning up contamin
regulated

05:37:25.750 --> 05:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
05:37:30.430 --> 05:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
contaminants and that um set of rules
 
05:37:33.190 --> 05:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
sets the requirements for facilities
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
that have generated contamination even
 
05:37:38.190 --> 05:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
if it's gone off of their property to
 
05:37:43.430 --> 05:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:52.548 --> 05:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:55.150 --> 05:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
followup could you repeat where that
 
05:37:57.548 --> 05:37:57.558 align:start position:0%
provision would be that extends that
 
05:38:00.030 --> 05:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
sure so um
 
05:38:02.548 --> 05:38:02.558 align:start position:0%
in um EnV
 
05:38:04.948 --> 05:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
o600 those are the rules for
 
05:38:08.230 --> 05:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
contaminated sites in New Hampshire
 
05:38:11.670 --> 05:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions requiring um both
 
05:38:14.470 --> 05:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
the investigation and the cleanup of
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
contamination um caused by releases even
 
05:38:22.270 --> 05:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
if it has migrated off the site of
 
05:38:24.350 --> 05:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
origin thank
 
05:38:27.150 --> 05:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
you and representative Darby thank you
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:38:32.788 --> 05:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
question um my first question is
 
05:38:34.990 --> 05:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
um weal we've been talking about these
 
05:38:37.670 --> 05:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
four P um I guess these four the four
 
05:38:40.510 --> 05:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
that have mcls defined if the federal
 
05:38:43.350 --> 05:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
government or thereby the state um de
 
05:38:46.670 --> 05:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
came up with additional mcls um for
 
05:38:48.510 --> 05:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
other PS compounds would would this
 
05:38:50.830 --> 05:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
apply to those as
 
05:38:57.110 --> 05:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:02.190 --> 05:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
you from reading uh lines 16 and 17 of
 
05:39:06.390 --> 05:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
the bill uh it references um facilities
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
that have caused contamination greater
 
05:39:09.750 --> 05:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
than 100 parts per
 
05:39:12.788 --> 05:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
trillion um for past compounds for which
 
05:39:15.070 --> 05:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
ambient groundwater quality standards
 
05:39:17.990 --> 05:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
have been established so I would think
 
05:39:18.000 --> 05:39:19.350 align:start position:0%
have been established so I would think
as

05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:39:21.510 --> 05:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
additional ambient groundwater quality
 
05:39:23.190 --> 05:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
standards are established for additional
 
05:39:25.948 --> 05:39:25.958 align:start position:0%
past compounds that would be covered in
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
here or followup thank you chair thank
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you again taking my question um so
 
05:39:34.990 --> 05:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
I I understand that the the definitions
 
05:39:36.788 --> 05:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
at the top of this came from other
 
05:39:40.590 --> 05:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
Statue um like you were mentioning a
 
05:39:42.910 --> 05:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
second ago pasas is ubiquitous like it's
 
05:39:45.948 --> 05:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
everywhere and so when I you know
 
05:39:49.948 --> 05:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
naively read um stored and disposed of I
 
05:39:52.708 --> 05:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
think of things that just have pasas on
 
05:39:54.468 --> 05:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
them they're not like you know just the
 
05:39:59.670 --> 05:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
raw chemical itself so is um does does
 
05:40:01.548 --> 05:40:01.558 align:start position:0%
this get interpreted
 
05:40:04.548 --> 05:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
as just these raw chemicals as opposed
 
05:40:06.628 --> 05:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
to things that are already manufactured
 
05:40:09.390 --> 05:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
with them and and thereby disposed that
 
05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
that contain them meaning like like
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
imagine just a normal business happens
 
05:40:18.430 --> 05:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
to buy something like protective uh
 
05:40:22.190 --> 05:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
um um reain gear for example that has PS
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and then they dispose of that right
 
05:40:26.510 --> 05:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
they throw it away or whatever is that
 
05:40:33.708 --> 05:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:39.150 --> 05:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
well uh based on the definition
 
05:40:42.190 --> 05:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
here they they could be a past facility
 
05:40:44.430 --> 05:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
but when I read further into the bill
 
05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
about the requirements that the bill
 
05:40:49.150 --> 05:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
would set they would not get caught up
 
05:40:50.990 --> 05:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
in those requirements because the
 
05:40:52.788 --> 05:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
requirements pertain to facilities that
 
05:40:54.910 --> 05:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
have had a significant release that
 
05:40:57.670 --> 05:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
resulted in groundwater contamination or
 
05:41:00.070 --> 05:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
um surface water contamination of 100
 
05:41:04.510 --> 05:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
P any anyone else wishes to ask a
 
05:41:11.670 --> 05:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
question or rep
 
05:41:13.430 --> 05:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
05:41:14.670 --> 05:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our question and
 
05:41:16.910 --> 05:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
clarifying A couple of these things um
 
05:41:19.590 --> 05:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
I'm Al also from marac this is a I think
 
05:41:21.868 --> 05:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
we have a quorum actually of marac reps
 
05:41:24.468 --> 05:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
here in the room um my question is about
 
05:41:26.150 --> 05:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
the definitions I I heard representative
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
Rong and representative Derby refer to
 
05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
them that these definitions are prior
 
05:41:31.030 --> 05:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
statute but I see this as a new
 
05:41:33.750 --> 05:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph and I can't find it um where
 
05:41:35.070 --> 05:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
do these definitions come from did you
 
05:41:37.070 --> 05:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
guys write them are you happy with
 
05:41:39.510 --> 05:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
them or and where are they in statute
 
05:41:41.548 --> 05:41:41.558 align:start position:0%
because I I literally couldn't find
 
05:41:45.070 --> 05:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
them that's a good question I are you
 
05:41:46.590 --> 05:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with the p statute do you know
 
05:41:48.910 --> 05:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
if they're in
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
there I guess I would ask um uh for
 
05:41:55.628 --> 05:41:55.638 align:start position:0%
representative Darby when you referenced
 
05:41:57.070 --> 05:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
um from other Statue were you
 
05:41:58.830 --> 05:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
referencing s representative rung also
 
05:42:03.150 --> 05:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:07.070 --> 05:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
statute I think there was there was a a
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
enabling statute written 125 C says past
 
05:42:15.868 --> 05:42:15.878 align:start position:0%
means per FL FL alcohol polyl alcohol
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
substances that's all I could find was
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
125 C10 e uh and it doesn't actually say
 
05:42:25.868 --> 05:42:25.878 align:start position:0%
all so maybe it should I'm just asking
 
05:42:28.270 --> 05:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
where it came from if we know where it
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
is so we can make get consistent or
 
05:42:33.350 --> 05:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
accurate and should it say all which
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
means the 4700 some chemicals or it
 
05:42:36.910 --> 05:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
should just I heard somebody say was
 
05:42:38.708 --> 05:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
only four it's only four there's
 
05:42:42.628 --> 05:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
definitely more than four only the
 
05:42:46.750 --> 05:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
four well do I have the floor thank you
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
um to address representative M's
 
05:42:51.468 --> 05:42:51.478 align:start position:0%
question pasas is the chemical
 
05:42:54.868 --> 05:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
nomenclature of molecules that have
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
either saturated or part partially
 
05:43:00.830 --> 05:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
saturated carbon molecule in an alkal
 
05:43:04.190 --> 05:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
backbone um but in this so that is the
 
05:43:06.548 --> 05:43:06.558 align:start position:0%
definition that's just the scientific
 
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
stat you mentioned it was in statute so
 
05:43:10.270 --> 05:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
but is no I didn't mention it was in
 
05:43:12.708 --> 05:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
statute must have been someone else but
 
05:43:16.350 --> 05:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
um it does in this the later paragraph
 
05:43:20.190 --> 05:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
which you cited it it does restrict the
 
05:43:23.670 --> 05:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
application to the four pasts that are
 
05:43:27.548 --> 05:43:27.558 align:start position:0%
under regulation with uh ambient water
 
05:43:31.070 --> 05:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
quality standards so it does account for
 
05:43:33.910 --> 05:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
any uh situation where there is another
 
05:43:37.070 --> 05:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
molecule that meets the past definition
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
have if that does become uh or or does
 
05:43:44.670 --> 05:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
have a standard then it this this bill
 
05:43:46.670 --> 05:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
would then be applicable if it was if it
 
05:43:51.948 --> 05:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:55.230 --> 05:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
law uh and in answer to your question
 
05:43:59.990 --> 05:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
where do these um definitions like um
 
05:44:04.270 --> 05:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
PS facility Etc come from I to heard in
 
05:44:06.030 --> 05:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony earlier that they are from
 
05:44:08.670 --> 05:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but I wasn't aware where so I
 
05:44:09.948 --> 05:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
thought to myself I need to go back and
 
05:44:12.070 --> 05:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
look into that it's why I went and
 
05:44:13.990 --> 05:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
looked at it because it says new and I
 
05:44:15.390 --> 05:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
and I heard representative wrong say
 
05:44:18.390 --> 05:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
that they were in statute um my next my
 
05:44:20.510 --> 05:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
other question further question I I
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
could for a followup on the past
 
05:44:25.948 --> 05:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
facility line 11 or otherwise come to be
 
05:44:28.110 --> 05:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
located are we putting like fire
 
05:44:31.270 --> 05:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
stations and transfer stations in that
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
category because maybe we don't want to
 
05:44:36.270 --> 05:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
you know they have they all have Pas our
 
05:44:38.910 --> 05:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
recycling centers have a lot of them we
 
05:44:40.750 --> 05:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
deliberately send them there our fire
 
05:44:42.628 --> 05:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
fire departments
 
05:44:44.830 --> 05:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether that should be
 
05:44:46.708 --> 05:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
there or not so I'm asking for your
 
05:44:49.548 --> 05:44:49.558 align:start position:0%
expertise I on this I agree with you
 
05:44:51.548 --> 05:44:51.558 align:start position:0%
that it appears as written now that they
 
05:44:54.750 --> 05:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
would be included in that and so then uh
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
what what I would think about is what
 
05:44:58.468 --> 05:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
are the requirements that are being
 
05:45:03.510 --> 05:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
placed on the past facility and um for
 
05:45:06.430 --> 05:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
this bill what I read is that uh it
 
05:45:08.948 --> 05:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
would pertain to those facilities where
 
05:45:10.670 --> 05:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
there was more than 100 parts per
 
05:45:14.190 --> 05:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
trillion caused by a release of pasas
 
05:45:17.350 --> 05:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
which good could draw ined though a fire
 
05:45:20.788 --> 05:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
station that had had a release of um a f
 
05:45:22.350 --> 05:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
causing that level of contamination
 
05:45:22.360 --> 05:45:25.750 align:start position:0%
causing that level of contamination
that's

05:45:25.750 --> 05:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:29.788 --> 05:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
possible okay any questions questions
 
05:45:31.628 --> 05:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
any additional
 
05:45:34.430 --> 05:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative thank you for
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question so so we're not just
 
05:45:39.628 --> 05:45:39.638 align:start position:0%
talking about the the plant the physical
 
05:45:41.868 --> 05:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
plant we're talking
 
05:45:46.948 --> 05:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
about this area that's larger than the
 
05:45:49.628 --> 05:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
size of a factory
 
05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
where if according to 100 parts per
 
05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
trillion um P shows
 
05:45:59.070 --> 05:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
up where it's been used to treat did
 
05:46:01.510 --> 05:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
store generated disposed of or otherwise
 
05:46:02.910 --> 05:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
come to be
 
05:46:06.868 --> 05:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
located so this bill is sanctioning Dees
 
05:46:10.110 --> 05:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
to kind of sweep
 
05:46:13.150 --> 05:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
beyond the town of marac or I'm sorry
 
05:46:20.830 --> 05:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:25.788 --> 05:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
itself I read the bill as pertaining to
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
the cleaning and decommissioning of of
 
05:46:29.520 --> 05:46:30.708 align:start position:0%
the cleaning and decommissioning of of
the

05:46:30.708 --> 05:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:46:33.230 --> 05:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
facility uh
 
05:46:35.788 --> 05:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
so the the structures that would be
 
05:46:38.708 --> 05:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
cleaned and decontaminated would be at
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
the plant on the
 
05:46:43.948 --> 05:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
property that used and generated
 
05:46:47.350 --> 05:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
PS or followup just real quickly has
 
05:46:48.990 --> 05:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
there been any
 
05:46:53.750 --> 05:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:56.030 --> 05:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
fine it doesn't relate I'm sorry it
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't really relate to this bill but
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about ay that's moving
 
05:47:02.270 --> 05:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
out within the calendar
 
05:47:05.270 --> 05:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
year certainly Dees has enforcement
 
05:47:08.390 --> 05:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
Authority and I am not at Liberty to
 
05:47:12.910 --> 05:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
considered thank

questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:47:26.070 --> 05:47:26.080 align:start position:0%

excited about the fact that we're
 
05:48:35.070 --> 05:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
looking at this problem of liability and
 
05:48:37.628 --> 05:48:37.638 align:start position:0%
and how to make some advances for towns
