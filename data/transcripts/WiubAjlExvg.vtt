00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
safety complaints New Hampshire's
 
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
current refusal rate of 70% nearly
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
double the national average would be
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
substantially reduced because of the new
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
higher refusal penalty which would be
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
set to one year it would be greater than
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
and the penalty for complying in testing
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
which remains at 180 days dos also
 
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
believes the increased penalty for
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
refusing the test would dispel the
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
perception that refusing testing is the
 
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
smarter way to go because the suspension
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
for impaired driving for a firsttime
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
offense after testing positive would
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
remain at 6 months during the hearing we
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
heard that many drivers including
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
commercial drivers who depend on their
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles to earn a living wrongly assume
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
they can refuse to take the test with no
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
consequences doubling the penalty to a
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
year would have an adverse impact on
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
many people in New Hampshire a first
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
offender who has a license taken away
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
for a year has tremendous collateral
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
damage when it comes to employment
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
housing and getting groceries especially
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
in rural part of the state where there's
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
no public
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
transportation now Mr Speaker we also
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
heard testimony the current paperwork
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
given to people to show the consequences
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
of refusal is confusing at best we heard
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
in debate that 16-year-olds when 16year
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
we heard in debate that when
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
16-year-olds get their licenses they
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
sign a contract with implied consent
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
that they will always agree to a
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
breathalizer test even though they
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
cannot drink for five more years legally
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
and if your teens are anything like mine
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
remembering something specific for five
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
years or more is not exactly realistic
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
I've been asking them to put the milk
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
back in the fridge since they were five
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm still
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
waiting we've also heard that the way
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
people will learn about these increased
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
suspensions will be through an
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
advertising campaign
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
and a better designed
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
form however would it not make more
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
sense to redesign the form
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
now and provide public service
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
announcements on current law to see what
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
difference that can make in people's
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
behaviors surely our goal is better
 
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with the law and better
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
compliance with people choosing never to
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
drive while under the influence of any
 
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.830 align:start position:0%
drive while under the influence of any
substance

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
substance
 
00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919 align:start position:0%
ever um given the level of
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding regarding the
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
consequence of refusal that came out at
 
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and the lack of
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
emphasis on communicating this over the
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
years it raises the possibility and
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
probability there may be more of a
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
Communications or perception problem
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
than a penalty problem truly Mr Speaker
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is anti-liberty and one that
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
will penalize most those with the fewest
 
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
assets as one defense attorney told me
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
those who will benefit most from this
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
change in law will be the defense
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys who will get a huge surge in
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
clients this bill will not change change
 
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
Behavior it will just create more
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
billing opportunities for those
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
lawyers finally Mr Speaker I urge the
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
body to vote no on OTP so another motion
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
can be made and encourage the interested
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
parties to modify the current forms to
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
increase Clarity and use their intended
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
funds for advertising on ensuring people
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
understand the current penalties for
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
refusal as well as for reminding people
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
that it is never under any circumstances
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay to drive under the influence and Mr
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
please chair recognize your
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr Speaker I don't have
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
a speech prepared for this but I've been
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
a larm force for 30 years and we are at
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the list for states in the
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
country that have uh such low penalties
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
for refusing to take a blood or breast
 
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.070 align:start position:0%
for refusing to take a blood or breast
test

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh this is going to increase it from 6
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
months to a year um it's going to
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
incentivize more people to take the test
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh and that's going to make our road
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
safer so as far as the it being a
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
comprehension or a reading issue uh as
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh people not taking it
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
because they don't understand the
 
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
bill the these forms are read verbatim
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
they have to be read verbatim to the
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
people uh that are under arrest so they
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
understand the form fully each line is
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
read word for word the instructions on
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
the back are given to the people about
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
how long they're going to lose their
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
license if they uh refuse on a first
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
offense um raising it from 6 months to a
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
year is not a big ass it's going to put
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
us in line with the rest of the country
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh too many people are dying on the
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
roads uh we need to make people uh more
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
incent incentivized to take these tests
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the administrative
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
license suspension is pled out if
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
someone has a plea on a DUI anyways so
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
it may be a moot point at the end of the
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
day but
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
um raising it from six months to a year
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's time we uh we do that I I
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
encourage you to press the green button
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
on this not to pass motion thank you
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the
 
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:42.919 align:start position:0%
questions does the member yield the
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
questions member
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
yields thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
representative for for taking my
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
question forgive my ignorance but do you
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
know what the maximum loss of license
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
penalty is for a first offense DWI in
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
convicted so if you're convicted for DUI
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
it's um could be up to two years but
 
00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:07.710 align:start position:0%
it's um could be up to two years but
it's

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
a uh six month loss I believe or N9
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
month loss and it can have reduced so if
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
you take the idcmp program which is an
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol program in a timely manner you
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
could have it reduced down to uh I think
 
00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
it's 90 days for a first offense penalty
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
for license loss court ordered what
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
Administrative so this is an addition to
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
it it but it's a potential two years
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
potential twoe thank you does the member
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
yield to further questions no I don't
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
member does not
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%

loud the longer we take to allow members
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
to speak the longer we're going to be
 
00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:30.389 align:start position:0%
to speak the longer we're going to be
here

00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
tonight and so I'm making a honest
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
request to all of
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
you when you hear that there is a
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
division or a roll call move as quickly
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
possible to your seat and if you need to
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
have a conversation please take it out
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
into the anti room so we can move as
 
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
fastly as we can dur for the course of
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
this day it's going to be a long
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
day now the motion before us is ought to
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
pass in Senate Bill 418 this is a roll
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
call vote chair recognized
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
if I know that our current six-month
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
license suspension for refusing to
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
comply with a chemical test is already
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
in line with similar penalties in other
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
states and if I know that doubling the
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
length of suspension to a full year for
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
a first offense would impose tremendous
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
collapse feral damage on first offenders
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
who depend on their vehicles to earn a
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
living in a state where many people live
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
in rural areas with no access to public
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
transportation and if I also know that
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
our state's implied consent law is
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
widely misunderstood and makes it just
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
as likely that New Hampshire's chemical
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
test refusal problem is more a
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
communication problem than a penalty
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
problem then would I press the red
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
button so another motion can be made
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Che recognized representative
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
Roy for a parliamentary inquiry thank
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the second of all
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
states and refusals and if I know it's
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
no secret we basically learn in high
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
school don't take the
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
test and if I further know that if no
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
one takes the
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
test our death rate is going to continue
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
to go up because no one's going to get
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
convicted especially now with multiple
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
substance use would I then press thep
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
green button and make it the incentive
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
to take the test so that we can get
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
people help and save lives thank you
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%

education committee held a briefing with
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant office
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
the LBA on the first performance audit
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
of the special education dispute
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
resolution process program of the
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
Education the audit focused on the
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
access of parents to special Education
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
Services the audit was most critical of
 
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:33.990 align:start position:0%
Services the audit was most critical of
the

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
mismanagement of this service to parents
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
the department has yet to respond to the
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
and address the delinquencies noted in
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
the audit further the LBA has a pending
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
audit on the total special education
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
department performance that final report
 
00:33:57.549 --> 00:33:57.559 align:start position:0%
and its recommendations is outstanding
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
and will be reported in the forthcoming
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
months I cite these two audits to note
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
that there is an outstanding concern
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
about the management and the operation
 
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
of the special education department that
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be transparent and identify
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
needed management
 
00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
adjustments amendment
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
9995 is
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
premature to the to the complete of
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
these audits of the LBA a once the
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
audits have been completed then the
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
needed completed assessment of
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
addressing the necessary Management
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
Services can take place it is not
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
prudent to peac meal or Tinker with
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
portions of the needed
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
changes last week the house education
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
committee met and considered a similar
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
non- gerine amendment to
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%

00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
service Services were there in force to
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
oppose this 11th Hour attempt to modify
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
current parental access and consent to
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
special education
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
services although the amendment 995
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
eliminates a significant section of the
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
original non- gerain Amendment it does
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
not reflect the need to wait and address
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
the totality of the LBA recommendations
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
once the final findings are issued
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
colleagues I hope you would join me in
 
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.480 align:start position:0%

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
the full measure of the needed changes
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
here's what the amendment
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
does the amendment gives us information
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to uh object or
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
reject uh an IEP agreement in total or
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
in part but we don't know why many of
 
00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
these are doing this and we don't know
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
how many of them are doing this and we
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if those children are getting
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
the special ed services that they need
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
this was mentioned multiple times in the
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
audit the amendment requires the
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
department to track the number and
 
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
category of those refusals and also to
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
track the resolutions and the time
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
needed to resolve those
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
refusals the amendment also gives us
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
gives the ad advocate for special
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
education access to
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
information it's necessary for her to
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
fulfill her duties currently in law the
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
amendment requires the Department of
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
Education and The Advocate to sign a
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
memorandum of agreement for this access
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
in addition The Advocate will be
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
required to get parental permission for
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
Access that's required by state or
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
federal law these are safeguards
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
currently we're asking the special
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
education Advocate to do a job and not
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
giving her the tools to do the job
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
finally the amendment will give the
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
state consistency local school districts
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
can establish their own methods for
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
solving resolving disputes but those
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
vary from District to district and they
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have to report their
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
information this in Amendment will
 
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.950 align:start position:0%
information this in Amendment will
require

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
local districts to submit their plans to
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
the department and annually submit
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
information on local dispute topics and
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
resolutions these requirements provide
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
immediate benefits to The Advocate to
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
resolving IEP disputes and to improving
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
the dispute resolution process and most
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
importantly it's a step forward in
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
helping parents and children with
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know the
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%

advocates in opposition to sections that
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
are in this non-gain amendment and if I
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
know that state Auditors have cited the
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
Department's mishandling of special
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
education complaints and that the state
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
is now conducting a comprehensive audit
 
00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
of special education services and if I
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
the department can approve their own
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
management practices without this

funded publicity campaign a
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional referendum might actually
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
fail to secure the very high threshold
 
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
that referenda have to get in order to
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
pass when they go to the people to pass
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
this we need a univocal bipartisan
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
message to the citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
it's not easy in today's politics to get
 
00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:31.069 align:start position:0%
it's not easy in today's politics to get
a

00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
65% vote for anything I have a very very
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
divided poy and this fall in the
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
presidential election I anticipate an
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
evenly split electorate to have a
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
referenda on that on that ballot that
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
asks everybody to come together is going
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
to be a heavy heavy lift and for that
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
reason on the election law committee
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
many people who passionately support the
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
first in the nation primary thought it
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
would would be imprudent to try to put
 
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
this in the Constitution at this moment
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
consideration was whether
 
00:54:11.839 --> 00:54:13.430 align:start position:0%
consideration was whether
our

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
venerable New Hampshire Constitution is
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
location for a law about partisan
 
00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.470 align:start position:0%
location for a law about partisan
primaries

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
primaries
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution is among the very oldest
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
Democratic constitutions in the
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
world it's older obviously than the
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution we have a
 
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to respect our
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
constitution by only amending it when
 
00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.109 align:start position:0%
constitution by only amending it when
absolutely

00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
necessary whether this amendment is
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
necessary remains an open question it's
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
something that deserves more
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
consideration more reflection and
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
deserves the kind of deliberation that
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
can produce real bipartisan consensus
 
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason I'm hopeful that
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
you'll vote against this ought to pass
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
motion so that we could make a different
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
motion sure recogniz Representative
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker so we've had a law
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
that says we go first for a long time
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
and until recently it has served well
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
but you know what people aren't taking
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
it seriously anymore as evidenced by the
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
fact that in this most recent one we
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
received a sternly worded letter
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
ordering us to change our laws change
 
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
our date to facilitate the desires of a
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
political party I would like to remind
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
them first of all we put it on we pay
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
for it we set the rules that's just how
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
it is they should respect that because
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
when candidates come here they are
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
coming here to earn the respect and
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
Trust of Voters lousy way to start and
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
both parties have done it before you
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
think I'm throwing partisan attacks out
 
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
here so that sternly worded letter what
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you to do today is see
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
that sternly worded letter and raise on
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
the voice of the people I'm not afraid
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
of the answer if we put this on the
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
ballot the people of New Hampshire have
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
earned this right for decades there was
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
a pie of place in Manchester that had a
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
picture of George W bush serving french
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
fries that isn't folksy it's not quaint
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
it's not cute when the candidates come
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
here and serve our coffee and cook our

Bill 440 this is a division vote I'll be
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
an order
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Nagel
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker if and I know that despite the
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
edaa vote and despite what seems like
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
Decades of testimony there are six
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
passionate speakers here ready to debate
 
01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
indicating that the issues raised by
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
this bill are far from settled and if I
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
know that the current bill is lacking
 
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
and MTI stakeholder support and the
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
proposed floor amendment has not been
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
subject to either legislative or
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholder review and if I know that
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
the primary basis for this bill was to
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
increase rural access to Eye Care yet
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
studies in both Kentucky and Oklahoma
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
after much more permissive legislation
 
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
was passed failed to show any such
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
increase and furthermore if I know that
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
optometrists are not medical doctors are
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
considered primary eye care doctors and
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
they receive minimal General Medical
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
Education and no formal Surgical educ
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
ation yet this bill would allow them to
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
perform several surgical procedures and
 
01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
furthermore if I know that based on
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
testimony from two professors of
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
Optometry in Kentucky and Oklahoma the
 
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
only schools which actually allow
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
students to perform these procedures on
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
live patients confirmed that
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
optometrists received grossly inadequate
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
training in the proposed surgical
 
01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
procedures which has not even come close
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
to meeting the standards of sural
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
Representative this is a parliamentary
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
in I know all right almost done training
 
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
for similar procedures established for
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
MDS Do's podiatrists veterinarians or
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
dentists and finally this would if I
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
know that this would create a dramatic
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
paradigm shift and who is allowed surg
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
to perform surgery then I would come to
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that this bill is not
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
even close to being ready for prime time
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
and would support the table motion thank
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%

01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
quote my friend from Charlestown we've
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
got some some stuff to talk about and if
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
I know that polary procedures should be
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
short and when they're too long we need
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
to talk about these things would I not
 
01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%

motion thank you Mr Speaker members I
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
rise today to support this floor
 
01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it's because we have
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
passed this same the the bill that this
 
01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment duplicates twice through
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
this house this term it's not often that
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
we pass a bill through this chamber two
 
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
times in one term to get the other body
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
to do some action with it but the fact
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
that we have shows that this this body
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
which is closer to the people has shown
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
that the people of New Hampshire want
 
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.430 align:start position:0%
that the people of New Hampshire want
something

01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
done the other body likes to call itself
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
the upper chamber which implies that
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
that body is elevated above the house
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
but that's not
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
true there's a reason why all our
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
salaries are the same in the state
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
constitution we're co-equal
 
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
branches we're not employees that need
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
to be reigned in by upper management
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
because their our ideas are those of the
 
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
people and they may not align with them
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
I ask you to pass this amendment to try
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
to restore some balance and send a
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
message balance between the two Chambers
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
by pushing this discussion and
 
01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.910 align:start position:0%
by pushing this discussion and
compromise

01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
forward please help me send this message
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
I ask for your support on this floor
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment and let's give them another
 
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
time one more chance to get it right

motion thank you Mr Speaker I thought I
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
had a couple more minutes to prepare but
 
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
um I think I know this pretty
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
well this amendment is based upon on HP
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
1620 which passed our house and
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
environmental committee um
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
unanimously based upon working
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly for the citizens of New
 
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the house support was
 
01:26:14.109 --> 01:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
351 to only seven in
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
opposition on the Senate side when our
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
bill went over it was
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
55 to
 
01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
7 there is no question right now that we
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
are actually good in New Hampshire for
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
another 25 to 30 years at
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
minimum and that's not including the
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
reduction um the the reduction plans
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
that we have in way in in place um based
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
upon our Solid Waste
 
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
goals right now we are asking for a
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
pause until July of
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
2028 because the rules are in shambles
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
we have a full lee8 crisis right now
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
happening in
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem um every ton of waste that's
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
going north at least a ton of leech
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
eight is going south to Manchester to
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
conquer to Franklin and we just
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
discovered recently that we are actually
 
01:27:10.639 --> 01:27:12.750 align:start position:0%
discovered recently that we are actually
taking

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
in millions of um millions of tons most
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
likely at this point of leech eight from
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
a landfill in
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
Vermont there are so many things that we
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
and I want everyone to know that this is
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
not going to sacrifice the underlying
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
Bill we're hoping that this is going to
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
send a message that maybe we could go to
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference and actually
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
finally have the New Hampshire citizens
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
voices be heard the one piece I wanted
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
to say the Senate received over 1,800
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
phone calls these are people from all
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
over New Hampshire saying we need
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
I will end
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
with de's own data makes it clear that
 
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
the earliest need for an additional
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity is
 
01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
2034 when our bill first came out we had
 
01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
2031 we worked on a part partisan way
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
and we made it to
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
2028 and based on the recent testimony
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
from Waste Management which is in
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
Rochester regarding their potential
 
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
expansion we have more than enough
 
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
capacity to over
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
2050 we really need all sides to come
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
together at this point to protect the
 
01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
health and the well-being of New
 
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens and the New Hampshire
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
advantage and our environment we don't
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
want we don't want this to be our
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker just this week the Department of
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services held a public
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on a proposed landfill sighting
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
rules this update to the rules happens
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
important environmental
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
experts concern conc ered
 
01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
citizens and legislators from both sides
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
aisle voiced their
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
opposition unanimously to the rules
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
update because they are weaker than the
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
previous rules they are slightly better
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
than the previous rules but they have
 
01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:49.070 align:start position:0%
than the previous rules but they have
become

01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
weakened in the different variations
 
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
that our commit was
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
shown they started at a certain point
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
again therefore because the Draft rules
 
01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
do not provide the protections Granite
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
Staters need and deserve we are asking
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
for your support on this
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
amendment we must not go forward with a
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
new landfill
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%

raise teacher salaries to a more
 
01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
competitive level because their local

01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
serve to recruit Educators to begin

01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
help retain these same Educators to stay
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
with a modest salary boost here's how it
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
works eligible new graduates existing

their district for those four years the
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%

grantee the New Hampshire higher
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%

01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
authorization within this bill to
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%

01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
funding the program in this bill is
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
modeled after the successful Idaho
 
01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
incentive program targeting rural
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
teacher shortages and is supported by
 
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
critical stakeholders like Nea New
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire critics say that this program
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
is best left to negotiations for future
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
budgets but we know the teaching
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
shortage in New Hampshire's most Rural
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
and underserved areas need attention
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
today improvements on the shortages in
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
one corner of the state will assist to
 
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
relieve shortages in all corners of the
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
state that's why we can't afford to wait
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
on this critical program and that is why
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
the initial appropriation of $1 for the
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ending June 30th 2025 will
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
Propel the commission and the Department
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
of Education to begin rule making and to
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
build up the program while aspiring not
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
mandating more robust Appropriations in
 
01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.750 align:start position:0%
mandating more robust Appropriations in
future

01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
Bia rest assured a vote for this bill
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
will leave the future funding control
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
within our future
 
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
legislature therefore Mr Speaker passage
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
of this bill is warranted given the near
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
zero fiscal impact the potential return
 
01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
on future investment a house education
 
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
committee's unanimous bipartisan support
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
and this body's recent Voice vote to
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
approve the bill on consent Mr Speaker I
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote no on the itl motion so
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
that another more appropriate motion may
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
be made thank you Mr Speaker and I
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
Emerich thank you Mr Speaker I thank my
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
colleague for outlining the pro the
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
program it's an excellent
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
program however from a financial
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint what we're being asked to do
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
is to obligate a future
 
01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislature so I I recommend the itl
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it's our position
 
01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
is 12,000 I mean the program itself
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
allocates $112,000 per new teacher so
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's saying what we're going to spend
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say how much it's going
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
to cost there was no fiscal note on this
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill so all we're doing is we're setting
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
up a debt for the future legislature so
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
support representative Granger has
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
requested a roll roll call is that
 
01:37:54.159 --> 01:37:56.390 align:start position:0%
requested a roll roll call is that
sufficiently

01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
sufficiently
 
01:37:58.750 --> 01:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.709 --> 01:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
us is a majority committee report of
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
inexperience to legislate on Senate Bill
 
01:39:25.149 --> 01:39:25.159 align:start position:0%
217 Mr R call vote chair recognizes
 
01:39:31.149 --> 01:39:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
that Senate Bill 2117 was a bill that
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
was recommended by the T teacher
 
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
shortage commission and if I further
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
know our Northern and Rural communities
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
struggle to find teachers especially in
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
areas like math and science for their
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
classrooms would I now press the red
 
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
button so another motion can be made
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker do I recognize
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the future costs
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
of this bill are not known and if I
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
further know that this body relies on

welcome to the early summer day uh I'm
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
here mainly as a selectman from Hamstead
 
01:44:19.149 --> 01:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
this B this bill was originally to uh
 
01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
compensate the town my town for the fact
 
01:44:24.669 --> 01:44:24.679 align:start position:0%
that the state moved
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
into uh a small
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh and bought the land and
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to build a facility there
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
for mentally
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
ill uh and this had a real impact on our
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
town so this bill was important and I
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
won't go into that if if you've watched
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
a uh uh Communications particularly I
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
spoke on in the finance committee and
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill so this is an A bill
 
01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
is very important to us and we would
 
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:02.679 align:start position:0%
like to have it clean however would you
 
01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
believe I showed up uh at the session
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
this morning I'm feeling good about this
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
bill I wouldn't even have to speak about
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
it the chair the speaker would you know
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
say all those in favor and the way we go
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's no issue involved really here
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh it's doing the right thing and I find
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
out that is uh non
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
gerain I like that word non gerain uh
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
Bill attached to my to my bill and why
 
01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:34.070 align:start position:0%
Bill attached to my to my bill and why
is

01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
that I really don't know I been here for
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
a while and I can tell you that when we
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
get to the short Strokes like we are now
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of our session watch out for
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
non gerain

bills this uh bill is
 
01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh article rather uh amend Amendment
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
rather has nothing to do with our
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
bill and I think the issue has been
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
discussed uh
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%

01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
culturally
 
01:52:25.069 --> 01:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
there's two good reasons for that first
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
of all we already have laws and um a
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission that work hard
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure we don't discriminate
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
racially in employment so we shouldn't
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
be telling um the Departments to to
 
01:52:45.790 --> 01:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
racially discriminate in in terms of
 
01:52:49.069 --> 01:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
employment but also so originally I was
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
just going to ask to remove the word but
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh at the suggestion of the Department
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
Services um I'm proposing that we change
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
it to the word culturally which is what
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
what they intend to do because in child
 
01:53:05.199 --> 01:53:06.229 align:start position:0%
what they intend to do because in child
re

01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
re
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
rearing um there may be cultural
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
differences um and therefore that should
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
be taken into account and also there may
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
be language differences among different
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
cultures and perhaps that should be
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
taken into account so it's a very simple
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
change it's enthus enthusiastically
 
01:53:26.109 --> 01:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
supported um by the Department of Health
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%

Amendment
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
2083 H is recognize to speak to her
 
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr Speaker uh julas and
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
midwives play a very very important role
 
01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
in bringing the new generation into this
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
world but with birth we need to also
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
address the trauma from sexual assault
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
that is why we have this amendment to
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
add the language of House Bill 378 378
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
is a bill that was passed on consent
 
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
that simply would have the Department of
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
Justice condense a 207 page document
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
they have about the rights of sexual
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
assault survivors into a one to two page
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
document done through the rulemaking
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
process so that people know their rights
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
there's actually already another one but
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's 40 pages it was hard for me to get
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
through and I wasn't just hadn't just
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
been assaulted this is critical because
 
01:54:52.069 --> 01:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
if a woman is denied the ability to have
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
her rights to know what she can have in
 
01:54:57.069 --> 01:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
a sexual assault kit what support she
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
can have and if she never gets to a sane
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
nurse she will carry that trauma forward
 
01:55:04.629 --> 01:55:04.639 align:start position:0%
with her it Expresses in many different
 
01:55:06.750 --> 01:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
ways and difficulty in childbirth is one
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
of them I have too many friends who ran
 
01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
into challenges because that trauma that
 
01:55:14.189 --> 01:55:14.199 align:start position:0%
had never been addressed came back
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
again we had been working diligently on
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
this language to address some concerns
 
01:55:20.669 --> 01:55:20.679 align:start position:0%
in the other body I thought we were
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
moving forward to be able to to work
 
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office and
 
01:55:26.189 --> 01:55:26.199 align:start position:0%
come to a committee of conference to
 
01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
come to some agreements on the language
 
01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly both bodies have
 
01:55:33.629 --> 01:55:33.639 align:start position:0%
had a lot of bills to do unfortunately
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday the other body decided to
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
indefinitely postpone this
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill they voted to indefinitely postpone
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
a bill to notify sexually assault sexual
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
assault survivors of their rights I
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
cannot imagine and I cannot fathom that
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
they still have the opportunity to
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
resend that and I would hope that they
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
do but sending this message that women
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
are important that survivors need to be
 
01:55:58.189 --> 01:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
heard and they're not going to be told
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
to be sit down be quiet we know what's
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
best for you is critical so I ask for
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
your support in sending this message
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
that we support survivors and that this
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
body has an equal seat at the table
 
01:56:11.239 --> 01:56:12.270 align:start position:0%

to 350% of poverty not already paid for
 
02:04:41.549 --> 02:04:41.559 align:start position:0%

eligibility cap as proposed in this
 
02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
amendment for a family of four is about

$105,000 to put this into perspective
 
02:04:53.069 --> 02:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
the median house so income in the state
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%

those low to Middle inome families who
 
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
fall into the bottom 50% of New

that School meals play a critical role
 
02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
in a student's attendance well-being and
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
academic success a healthy diet can give
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
the child the energy to think work and
 
02:05:25.069 --> 02:05:25.079 align:start position:0%

02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
education as buses books computers or

the internet yet kids access to those
 
02:05:33.149 --> 02:05:33.159 align:start position:0%

02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
families struggle to pay the bills
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
including dealing with the rising cost
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
of putting food on the table over half
 
02:05:41.470 --> 02:05:41.480 align:start position:0%

are not fed but schools take care of
 
02:07:23.069 --> 02:07:23.079 align:start position:0%

02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
free reduced meals up to 185% of the
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
medium family
 
02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
income and now we want to extend this to
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
350% of the family medium income which
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
is as been previously spoken to about
 
02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
is as been previously spoken to about
approximately

02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
02:07:52.589 --> 02:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
$105,000 for that family of four
 
02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
right now we get reimbursement from the
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
federal government up to
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
185% we do not get any reimbursement
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
number and so this the taxpayer the
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
local state taxpayers is going to have
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
to pick up this
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
burden roughly 160,000 students in our
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
state K through
 
02:08:18.030 --> 02:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
12 using these numbers right here 60% of
 
02:08:21.069 --> 02:08:21.079 align:start position:0%
that 160,000 kids are going to be
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
receiving reing this free
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
meal we're going to have to cough up
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
that money and we haven't spoken about
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue yet but the fiscal report
 
02:08:31.629 --> 02:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education says
 
02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 50 and 75 million
 
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
do 50 to 75
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
million on top of this we often times
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
speak of local control we have 38
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
schools in this state
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
which do not involve themselves with the
 
02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:57.639 align:start position:0%
lunch program or the breakfast program
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
they provide it
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
themselves now what they're going to
 
02:09:03.549 --> 02:09:03.559 align:start position:0%
have to do if they're mandated to
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
provide this program the federal program
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to beef up their
 
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
kitchens they're going to have to hire
 
02:09:12.030 --> 02:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
more personnel and there again there's a
 
02:09:14.189 --> 02:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
local expense involved for those 38
 
02:09:16.669 --> 02:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
schools who School boards are making
 
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
local decision we'll do this through a
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
contracted service or we'll do it
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
ourselves but we're not getting involved
 
02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
with the feds so in conclusion I ask you
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%

02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
Speaker colleagues if I know that the
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
information I just heard from the
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
chairman of the education committee is
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
in accurate today as it was when hb1
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
1212 came before and if I know because
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
the analytics show us that Maine and
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont provide Universal meals for $34
 
02:11:29.950 --> 02:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
million not the 50 or 75 for one meal we
 
02:11:32.109 --> 02:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
just heard quoted it was wrong then and
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's wrong now not his numbers doe
 
02:11:38.109 --> 02:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
numbers and he is correct every single
 
02:11:40.270 --> 02:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
School in this state every one of your
 
02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
schools where you support and you
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
represent is in debt today on non-funded
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
meals from youngsters who have nothing
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
when they get there and the school
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
district is picking up some as they can
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
if they happen to be able to identify a
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
youngster but that means there's a lot
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
of other kids there a lot of students
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
not being fed now let me just imagine
 
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
this every one of you I presume today if
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
I know everyone here
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:13.709 --> 02:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
order continue thank you if I know that
 
02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
most everyone here today had the
 
02:12:18.270 --> 02:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have breakfast and
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
probably could afford breakfast and I
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
know that everyone here today has the
 
02:12:24.189 --> 02:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a free meal as you
 
02:12:26.910 --> 02:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
did last time 1212 came up but
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
youngsters who are getting up in the
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
morning at 6 a.m. going to school
 
02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
without breakfast getting on a bus at
 
02:12:33.870 --> 02:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
7:00 getting there at 7:30 and not
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
having a meal do not have that
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity and if I know that this
 
02:12:41.229 --> 02:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
process will allow them to do
 
02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
that in
 
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
conclusion if I know that we came here
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
for one purpose which was to make New
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Better academics sound
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
education makes New Hampshire better
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
then would you please press the green
 
02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
button so we can get on with the
 
02:12:56.350 --> 02:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
business that my good friend art Ellison
 
02:12:59.069 --> 02:12:59.079 align:start position:0%
used to say and just feed the damn kids
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognize ripson of Vlad
 
02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
02:13:15.910 --> 02:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this bill requires the
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility threshold for federal school
 
02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
meal programs raises the level from from
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
185% of the median family income to
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
350% of the poverty level would require
 
02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
State taxpayer funds to cover the
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
difference as no fidal reimbursement is
 
02:13:36.189 --> 02:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
provided if I know the Department's
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis the Department's fiscal
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
analysis on the bill estimates the total
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
cost of this program could be more than
 
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
50 million per year to provide a lunch
 
02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
for 60% of the 160,000 students in New
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public schools and lastly if
 
02:13:57.549 --> 02:13:57.559 align:start position:0%
I know not all schools currently
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
participate in the national school lunch
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
program or breakfast program and this
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
bill does not require that they
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
participate however if pass the state
 
02:14:10.549 --> 02:14:10.559 align:start position:0%
would be required to pay the cost and of
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
the meals for all students that qualify
 
02:14:16.270 --> 02:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
even the current 38 schools that do not
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
participate in the school lunch or
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%

02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%

02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
the child's best interest shall be the
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
Court's primary consideration in all
 
02:28:57.269 --> 02:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
proceedings under this chapter second
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
the finance committee Amendment changes
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
section three with regards to parental
 
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
Fitness hearings the amendment changes
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
the language of presumption of Fitness
 
02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
to deem fit which is legal which is
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
legal language that would indicate a
 
02:29:15.469 --> 02:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
finding it also changes the standard of
 
02:29:17.550 --> 02:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
proof required from preponderance of the
 
02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
evidence used through RSA 16 69c
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
including what is needed for dcyf to
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
remove a child from a parent to clear
 
02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.710 align:start position:0%
remove a child from a parent to clear
and

02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
convincing the uh bail the comparison to
 
02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
the bail standard is entirely misleading
 
02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
and misplaced as bill is a criminal in
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
nature and not addressed in RSA
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
169c uh finally the committee Amendment
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
changes in the amendment that would
 
02:29:45.150 --> 02:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
probably cause potential danger to
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
children at risk is the change made to
 
02:29:50.269 --> 02:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
Unique needs which is an incomplete
 
02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
definition excluding essential factors
 
02:29:54.510 --> 02:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
such as psychological and
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
educational uh needs if a def if a
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
definition of unique needs excluding the
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
clause and whether or not the parent is
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
adequately prepared to address those
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
needs which is essential to the safety
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
child the children and family law
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
committee worked with due
 
02:30:19.710 --> 02:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
diligence and came up unanimously with
 
02:30:22.110 --> 02:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
the best supporting the best interest of
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
the child and I urge you to oppose the
 
02:30:27.910 --> 02:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh committee's Amendment thank you Mr
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
H thank you Mr Speaker good morning this
 
02:30:41.190 --> 02:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill has to do with out of home
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
placements last year we found out about
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of kids who were shipped out of
 
02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
state to Tennessee and were dreadfully
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
abused down there
 
02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
there we need to do our best to make
 
02:30:55.710 --> 02:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
sure we keep children in the state that
 
02:30:57.469 --> 02:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
have been removed either from a home
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's abusing or neglecting them or
 
02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
through some judicial process because
 
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
they had committed a crime either way we
 
02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
need to find ways to keep them in the
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
state so we can address those K
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
children's needs
 
02:31:12.990 --> 02:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
here the amendment before you makes some
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
critical changes to make this
 
02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
happen the former speaker for Manchester
 
02:31:20.429 --> 02:31:20.439 align:start position:0%
talked about well we're changing the
 
02:31:25.389 --> 02:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
definitions relative to um when kids are
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
taken well it's not taken the chapter
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
we're impacting is for a parent not
 
02:31:34.030 --> 02:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
choose sorry not charged with abuse or
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
neglect so we might have a divorced
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
couple where a mom or a dad ends up
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
being charged with abuse or neglect and
 
02:31:44.950 --> 02:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
we want to get the child to the other
 
02:31:46.830 --> 02:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
spouse as quick as
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
possible today's Law requires that other
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
spouse to go to the court and to demand
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
that they be seen as innocent no other
 
02:31:57.230 --> 02:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
place in our statutes do we require
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
someone to prove their innocence before
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
they can be a DAT
 
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
again the amendment carefully crafts
 
02:32:06.510 --> 02:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
language to address this it keeps in
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
place necessary things like looking for
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
The Unique needs of the child relative
 
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
to physical mental emotional or medical
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
needs it makes sure that if there is a
 
02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
concern about this not parent not
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
charged that DC CF or another agency can
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
interrupt the process and go to the
 
02:32:26.349 --> 02:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
court and make a complaint this is the
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
way we treat everybody except for this
 
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
narrow F set of set of cases where we
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
have a parent who is absent for some
 
02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
period of time and that could have been
 
02:32:38.870 --> 02:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
for a court order and they are
 
02:32:41.309 --> 02:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
asked the they have to now go demand
 
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
their innocence with the
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
court the bill also adds some additional
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
staff to dcyf we heard test testimony in
 
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
and and this is true of all the
 
02:32:56.110 --> 02:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
Amendments we heard testimony that that
 
02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
quantity of staff may be excessive so
 
02:33:00.190 --> 02:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
that's something that longterm needs to
 
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
be addressed it is my understanding that
 
02:33:04.750 --> 02:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed today with this
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
amendment the likelihood is it's going
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
to a committee of conference to work out
 
02:33:10.750 --> 02:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
details with the Senate with that said I
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
would ask that you would support
 
02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:13.670 align:start position:0%
would ask that you would support
Amendment

02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:33:16.110 --> 02:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
19238 and I ask for a roll call thank
 
02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:20.670 align:start position:0%

representative P has asked for a roll
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
call is that sufficiently seconded it is
 
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
02:33:59.710 --> 02:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is Amendment 1 1923
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
H this is going to be a roll call vote
 
02:34:51.870 --> 02:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative priest
 
02:34:57.830 --> 02:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:00.269 --> 02:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
02:35:03.870 --> 02:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that
 
02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:05.429 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that
Amendment

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
2024 1923 H goes against the primary
 
02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of the current
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
statute 169
 
02:35:20.349 --> 02:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
c-2 the mandatory report rep in of
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
suspected instances of child abuse and
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
neglect this protects children whose
 
02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
lives Health and Welfare are in danger
 
02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
and is contrary to the child's best
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
interest if I know that the amendment
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
changes the standat proof required by
 
02:35:48.429 --> 02:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence used
 
02:35:52.389 --> 02:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the existing RSA
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
169c including what is needed to remove
 
02:36:01.870 --> 02:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
a child from a parent to clear and con
 
02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:02.750 align:start position:0%
a child from a parent to clear and con
and

02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
convincing this comparison to Bell
 
02:36:11.190 --> 02:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
standards is misleading and misplaced as
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
bill is criminal in nature and not
 
02:36:16.110 --> 02:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
addressed in
 
02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:17.910 align:start position:0%

169c a civil procedure meant to protect

children again this would put more
 
02:36:30.030 --> 02:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
children at risk and if I know that this
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
amendment would probably cause potential
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
danger to Children at Risk by changing
 
02:36:40.110 --> 02:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
the definition of unique

to address those needs
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%

02:37:35.269 --> 02:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
that some bills are put together in
 
02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
haste and if I further suspect that this
 
02:37:40.469 --> 02:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
bill impetus was we have to do something

report uh thank you Mr Speaker I I'm
 
02:47:47.870 --> 02:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
rising today to encourage an I vote
 
02:47:49.469 --> 02:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
overturning the committee
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation I um this first came to
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
division 3 and I was uh in favor of it
 
02:47:58.349 --> 02:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
initially because I care deeply about
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
patient care particularly in underserved
 
02:48:03.389 --> 02:48:03.399 align:start position:0%
areas and having worked in health care
 
02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
for over 45 years I really appreciate
 
02:48:09.389 --> 02:48:09.399 align:start position:0%
what the nursing Community does for uh
 
02:48:13.030 --> 02:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
our society uh but this bill did not
 
02:48:16.110 --> 02:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
werewell on me as I started to think
 
02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
about the testimony we heard we heard
 
02:48:21.389 --> 02:48:21.399 align:start position:0%
that we would be spending
 
02:48:26.190 --> 02:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
$300,000 in general funds to help six
 
02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
people do what is called loan
 
02:48:31.790 --> 02:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
forgiveness there is no loan forgiveness
 
02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
there is a transfer of the loan debt
 
02:48:37.550 --> 02:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
voluntarily taken by a person
 
02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
transferred to the general public there
 
02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
is no forgiveness there's just a debt
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
transfer um and so um I would I I
 
02:48:48.349 --> 02:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
confirm the six by the way you're going
 
02:48:50.030 --> 02:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
to hear much bigger numbers you're going
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
to hear as many as 17 or something but I
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
asked very specifically how many people
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be affected and there was no
 
02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in the answer there's six
 
02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:00.950 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in the answer there's six
people

02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
300,000 that's 50,000 each now to go
 
02:49:06.830 --> 02:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
into an underserved area you're probably
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
going into a community where the median
 
02:49:11.950 --> 02:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
income is only $50,000 and here the
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
state is going to grant that much money
 
02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
to a single individual to go provide uh
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
critical and important care but this is
 
02:49:23.870 --> 02:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
the kind of economic micromanagement
 
02:49:26.349 --> 02:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
that really makes very bad policy over
 
02:49:28.910 --> 02:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
the long run so I would uh I would
 
02:49:32.590 --> 02:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support an
 
02:49:35.070 --> 02:49:35.080 align:start position:0%

allowing for members of the General
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:48.750 --> 04:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
institution chair recognized
 
04:31:48.760 --> 04:31:53.550 align:start position:0%
institution chair recognized
representative

04:31:53.550 --> 04:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.109 --> 04:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
speaker I bring this forward because I
 
04:32:02.950 --> 04:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
was denied the ability to inspect and
 
04:32:05.070 --> 04:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
tour the county jail in my county and
 
04:32:07.229 --> 04:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
also the state prison unless I was
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
essentially put on a leash and brought
 
04:32:13.630 --> 04:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
around with the director the head of the
 
04:32:15.389 --> 04:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
director of the Department of
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
Corrections from Jean Graham now the
 
04:32:18.630 --> 04:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
reason I'm bringing this forward I
 
04:32:19.349 --> 04:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
understand this is the end of the
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
session everybody's trying to wrap
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
things up but I was just recently denied
 
04:32:24.670 --> 04:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
from my County the ability to be a
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
religious volunteer as well as somebody
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
that was inside I think it's important
 
04:32:31.070 --> 04:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
to talk to these inmates especially on
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
account of the fact that now we're on
 
04:32:33.550 --> 04:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
the hook
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
for oh okay that were on the hook for
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
$38 million law uh settlement from the
 
04:32:43.229 --> 04:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
YDC cases because quite frankly people
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
in this chamber did not visit these
 
04:32:48.030 --> 04:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
facilities they did not talk to these
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
people and abuses went on for
 
04:32:53.670 --> 04:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
decades the idea that we should trust
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats to watch other bureaucrats
 
04:32:59.429 --> 04:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
is absurd we are the closest to the
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
people not appointed political
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
appointees I think that should be
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
self-evident from this NPR article May
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
15th the judge who oversaw a landmark
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
trial about New Hampshire's Youth
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
Detention Center has refused to discard
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
the $38 million verdict saying the
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
facilities leadership quote either knew
 
04:33:18.910 --> 04:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
and didn't care or didn't care to learn
 
04:33:20.990 --> 04:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
the truth quot end quote about endemic
 
04:33:22.830 --> 04:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
physical and sexual abuse there are more
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
than 1100 lawsuits now
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
pending my concern is that we do not
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in these facilities
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
from the most basic to how inmates spend
 
04:33:36.470 --> 04:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
their days to how the money is being
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
spent or pocketed and other things so I
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
put this bill forward well this
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
suspension of the rules cuz I think this
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
is important and I just received notice
 
04:33:47.230 --> 04:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
from my County the other day otherwise I
 
04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
would have put this in earlier the email
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
from the the state uh director of
 
04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
Corrections was from November of last
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
year but I had assumed that going
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
through the religious aspect would be a
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
way to do it I just think it's important
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
to talk to these people there is no way
 
04:34:04.869 --> 04:34:04.879 align:start position:0%
to really find out what's going inside
 
04:34:06.269 --> 04:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
the facilities and then you could say oh
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
well they can write us yeah okay you
 
04:34:09.789 --> 04:34:09.799 align:start position:0%
make what 10 cents an hour or something
 
04:34:12.670 --> 04:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's and then the other concern is
 
04:34:14.910 --> 04:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
people from the state prison have sent
 
04:34:16.470 --> 04:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
emails to all of us I know at least you
 
04:34:17.470 --> 04:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
received them you might have trashed
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
them but alleging that they were
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
terminated for raising
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
concerns so there is not an open channel
 
04:34:25.080 --> 04:34:26.070 align:start position:0%
concerns so there is not an open channel
of

04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:34:29.310 --> 04:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
communication and with that I would hope
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
that you would support transparency in
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
our institutions because that's our job
 
04:34:35.949 --> 04:34:35.959 align:start position:0%
and bureaucrats can't be trusted to
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
watch other bureaucrats those are the
 
04:34:39.070 --> 04:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
two main talking points and I'm going to
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
gar ask for roll call is that
 
04:34:46.160 --> 04:34:48.990 align:start position:0%
gar ask for roll call is that
sufficiently

04:34:48.990 --> 04:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently second this
 
04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.150 --> 04:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
the motion before it's a suspension of
 
04:36:29.551 --> 04:36:29.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:33.150 --> 04:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
order this is going to be a roll call
 
04:36:35.429 --> 04:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
vote the chair recognized representa
 
04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%

to I can assure you all that if I know
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%

delegation uh had the invitation to tour
 
04:37:00.670 --> 04:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
Our House of Corrections and if I
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
further know that the member involved
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
probably was denied because of his
 
04:37:09.910 --> 04:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
history uh would I now vote no on the
 
04:37:12.670 --> 04:37:12.680 align:start position:0%

amendment it's the bill that we passed a
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
few weeks
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
ago and it still does the same things
 
04:39:43.390 --> 04:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
it's still takes nobody's gun rights
 
04:39:43.400 --> 04:39:50.750 align:start position:0%
it's still takes nobody's gun rights
away

04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:53.230 --> 04:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
nobody it still takes nobody's gun
 
04:39:53.240 --> 04:39:55.150 align:start position:0%
nobody it still takes nobody's gun
rights

04:39:55.150 --> 04:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:39:58.110 --> 04:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
away the person who would be affected by
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
this R this bill already lost their gun
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
rights the moment they were committed
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
involuntarily think about this for a
 
04:40:08.910 --> 04:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
second and and seriously think about
 
04:40:12.390 --> 04:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
this for a second you are brought to
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
court because you are mentally ill to
 
04:40:19.868 --> 04:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
the point where you're dangerous you get
 
04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
examined by your own doctor the court
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
orders you to be examined by another
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
doctor you get a lawyer the lawyer can
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
argue on your behalf and cross-examine
 
04:40:32.110 --> 04:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
Witnesses against you after all that's
 
04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
done a judge not a bureaucrat makes a
 
04:40:38.470 --> 04:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
decision that you need to be committed
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
now not just for the the temporary exam
 
04:40:43.670 --> 04:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
commitment but a full commitment for 30
 
04:40:46.590 --> 04:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
days because the judge finds you to be a
 
04:40:49.788 --> 04:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
danger to yourself or others you get
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
committed you're in there for 30 days
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
receiving mental treatment should you be
 
04:40:56.948 --> 04:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
able to walk out the door across the
 
04:40:59.628 --> 04:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
street and buy a weapon even though just
 
04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
30 days ago you were committed because
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
you heard voices that said you should
 
04:41:02.718 --> 04:41:04.868 align:start position:0%
you heard voices that said you should
kill

04:41:04.868 --> 04:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
kill
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
people that is exactly what happens if
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
you have if you have schizoph renia you
 
04:41:13.868 --> 04:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
hear voices and sometimes they tell you
 
04:41:15.310 --> 04:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
to hurt
 
04:41:17.788 --> 04:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
people all we saying and this this
 
04:41:20.430 --> 04:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything but report that to
 
04:41:22.270 --> 04:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
the federal Nick system now let's talk
 
04:41:24.550 --> 04:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
about the Nick system where'd that come
 
04:41:26.990 --> 04:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
from I'm old enough to remember the
 
04:41:27.000 --> 04:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
from I'm old enough to remember the
Clinton

04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
Clinton
 
04:41:29.708 --> 04:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
Administration in the Clinton
 
04:41:31.230 --> 04:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
Administration there was something
 
04:41:32.830 --> 04:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
called a waiting period a national
 
04:41:35.708 --> 04:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
waiting period we all had to wait you
 
04:41:37.628 --> 04:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
couldn't just go buy a gun you had to
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
wait so the NRA stepped up and said
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
listen that's over we're going to work
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
on legislation so that people can get
 
04:41:47.150 --> 04:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
their firearms rights right away we
 
04:41:48.990 --> 04:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
propose an instant background check
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
system that's where ncks came from it
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
came from the NRA
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
so they said what gets submitted by the
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
states is what gets
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
checked just recently the NRA came out
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
and said the system's only so good as
 
04:42:07.550 --> 04:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
the information that gets put into
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
it what good is it if 99% of the state
 
04:42:13.470 --> 04:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
except for us put that information in
 
04:42:15.868 --> 04:42:15.878 align:start position:0%
there we submit felons we submit
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
restraining orders for some reason
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire decided that people who are
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
dangerously mentally ill we not going to
 
04:42:24.190 --> 04:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
submit it makes absolutely no sense
 
04:42:27.830 --> 04:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
whatsoever at all just recently now I
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
saw an email from some group recently
 
04:42:32.788 --> 04:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
that came out that said that this was
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
about a gun grab or some ridiculous
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
thing of course at the bottom of every
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
one of those emails is please send us
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
money but having said that oh yeah here
 
04:42:45.550 --> 04:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
they are the National associations for
 
04:42:48.190 --> 04:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
gun rights what do they have to say on
 
04:42:49.868 --> 04:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
the subject well I went to their page
 
04:42:51.550 --> 04:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
and said what are what's their position
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
on Mental Health it
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
says it shall be it says there has been
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
a consistent push to Grant agencies and
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
individuals the power to deem Americans
 
04:43:03.510 --> 04:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
mentally defective thereby depriving
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
them of their constitutional rights
 
04:43:07.868 --> 04:43:07.878 align:start position:0%
without due process mental health
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
restrictions on Firearms ownerships
 
04:43:13.430 --> 04:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
which circumvent due due process are
 
04:43:15.310 --> 04:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional what I just described
 
04:43:17.390 --> 04:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
to you is due process you go to judge
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
you go to court you have an attorney you
 
04:43:20.788 --> 04:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
can cross-examine you can present where
 
04:43:24.190 --> 04:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
so their arguments are invalid what does
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
the NRA say the NRA says just recently
 
04:43:29.830 --> 04:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
the systems only so good as what you put
 
04:43:32.430 --> 04:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
into it and they Advocate here's what
 
04:43:32.440 --> 04:43:33.390 align:start position:0%
into it and they Advocate here's what
they

04:43:33.390 --> 04:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
said exactly word for word it's been the
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
NRA's longstanding position that those
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
who have been adjudicated as a danger to
 
04:43:43.350 --> 04:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
themselves or others should not have
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
access to Firearms this wasn't 20 years
 
04:43:47.230 --> 04:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
ago this was
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
2020 so if anyone in here is saying well
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
the gun groups are saying pay attention
 
04:43:53.550 --> 04:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
because the gun groups change depending
 
04:43:56.110 --> 04:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
on who's in charge but Nicks was founded
 
04:43:59.310 --> 04:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
by the NRA and they believe it so as New
 
04:44:01.948 --> 04:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens do we want to be able
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
to face people when someone does
 
04:44:05.788 --> 04:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
something because we decided nope we're
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
just not going to do it even though all
 
04:44:08.910 --> 04:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
the other states are doing it we're not
 
04:44:11.150 --> 04:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to do it it makes no sense oh and
 
04:44:13.270 --> 04:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
did I mention we're leaving hundreds of
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars on the table the
 
04:44:15.840 --> 04:44:17.190 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars on the table the
federal

04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
government has established just recently
 
04:44:23.670 --> 04:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
under a bill called The Fix Nick Bill a
 
04:44:26.550 --> 04:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
fund to help States improve their
 
04:44:28.350 --> 04:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
electronic uh criminal justice
 
04:44:30.590 --> 04:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
Information Systems millions and
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars are dispersed to the
 
04:44:35.550 --> 04:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
states except for New Hampshire because
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
when we don't submit this information
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
we're not eligible so do we walk away
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
from that and the danger to our fellow
 
04:44:45.750 --> 04:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
citizens I don't think so I think that
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
we pass this one more time to send the
 
04:44:49.390 --> 04:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
people across the on the other side of
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
the wall the message that we believe in
 
04:44:55.868 --> 04:44:55.878 align:start position:0%
safety we believe in freedom but we also
 
04:44:57.550 --> 04:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
believe that there are limits and we
 
04:45:03.430 --> 04:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:06.030 --> 04:45:06.040 align:start position:0%

04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
know that this bill and this
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment does not criminalize mental
 
04:46:59.230 --> 04:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
health the people that are involved in
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
it have access to Due Process before any
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
of their rights are taken and
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
furthermore the bill itself doesn't take
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
rights but just reports the event that's
 
04:47:10.270 --> 04:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
already occurred to the federal Micks
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
background check that the NRA
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
established and asked for would I now

04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker I apologize
 
04:47:39.868 --> 04:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
for stepping ahead early if I know that
 
04:47:42.590 --> 04:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill has to do with
 
04:47:45.390 --> 04:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
setting aside money so we can design am
 
04:47:47.350 --> 04:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
Men's prison and that by adding an
 
04:47:49.628 --> 04:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
amendment we put in in Jeopardy the
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill if I know that the
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
language of the amendment says
 
04:47:56.990 --> 04:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other hold on I got
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
to not withstanding any other provision
 
04:48:00.830 --> 04:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the law including a requirement of a
 
04:48:04.510 --> 04:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
closed hearing and a file under RSA 135
 
04:48:06.510 --> 04:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
that's relative to mental health
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
records if I further know further know
 
04:48:12.030 --> 04:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
that these people people potentially
 
04:48:14.110 --> 04:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
might be in danger of suicide but this
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
will cause the unintended consequence of
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
them not seeking the mental health
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
treatment they need and furthermore if I
 
04:48:22.990 --> 04:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
know that every gun group in the state
 
04:48:25.390 --> 04:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
and many national ones stood opposed
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
would I now vote against the adoption of
 
04:48:30.030 --> 04:48:30.040 align:start position:0%

05:13:21.150 --> 05:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker the amendment CH chair recognize

wolf Mr Speaker and members of this
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
house I rise today to oppose Amendment
 
05:13:50.670 --> 05:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
1957 to SB
 
05:13:53.110 --> 05:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
499 Amendment
 
05:13:56.350 --> 05:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
1957 would remove the necessary funding
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
required for New Hampshire's
 
05:14:01.948 --> 05:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
participation in the summer EBT program
 
05:14:05.708 --> 05:14:05.718 align:start position:0%
summer EBT is a federally funded program
 
05:14:08.670 --> 05:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
that would bring in over 4 A5 million
 
05:14:11.350 --> 05:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
Federal doll each year for feeding
 
05:14:13.548 --> 05:14:13.558 align:start position:0%
hungry kids during the
 
05:14:16.190 --> 05:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
summer many children depend on School
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
meals but come summer they don't have
 
05:14:22.948 --> 05:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
access to them summer EBT programs would
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
con connect these children to the
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
nutrition that they need when school is
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
not in session the startup cost for
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
implementing EBT is about a million
 
05:14:37.230 --> 05:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
dollars in the first year however the
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
recurring cost to the state is very
 
05:14:42.990 --> 05:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
small about $ 265,000
 
05:14:43.000 --> 05:14:45.548 align:start position:0%
small about $ 265,000
this

05:14:45.548 --> 05:14:45.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:14:48.750 --> 05:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
$265,000 annual investment would allow
 
05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to unlock $4 and5 million
 
05:14:55.628 --> 05:14:55.638 align:start position:0%
dollar per year to feed over
 
05:14:59.350 --> 05:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
37,000 kids the 4 and A5 million would
 
05:15:01.548 --> 05:15:01.558 align:start position:0%
be directly invested into our economy
 
05:15:04.190 --> 05:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
every year being spent at local grocery
 
05:15:07.548 --> 05:15:07.558 align:start position:0%
stores farmers markets farms and other
 
05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
small business it's a win-win feed
 
05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
hungry children and stimulate our
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
economies and if we don't get the money
 
05:15:19.030 --> 05:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
from the feds we're not obligated to pay
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
it so if we don't invest the money over
 
05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
37,000 kids will go hungry every summer
 
05:15:30.510 --> 05:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
the state will leave 4 and A5 million
 
05:15:33.230 --> 05:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
federal dollars on the table New
 
05:15:36.110 --> 05:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers currently contribute
 
05:15:38.750 --> 05:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more to Washington than we receive
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
back back we should seize any
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity we have to make a smart
 
05:15:47.430 --> 05:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
modest investment to increase the
 
05:15:49.788 --> 05:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
state's federal revenue and invest in
 
05:15:52.590 --> 05:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's future the return on
 
05:15:55.708 --> 05:15:55.718 align:start position:0%
investment has a massive upside and the
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
risk is none it's a smart business for
 
05:16:01.750 --> 05:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I urge you to reject
 
05:16:01.760 --> 05:16:03.190 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I urge you to reject
Amendment

05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
1957 and to support an alternative
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1975
 
05:16:12.830 --> 05:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
1917 excuse me which will include the
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
necessary funding for the state to
 
05:16:17.948 --> 05:16:17.958 align:start position:0%
implement the EBT
 
05:16:23.110 --> 05:16:23.120 align:start position:0%

05:16:23.120 --> 05:16:24.150 align:start position:0%
program 1957 does not please join me in
voting

05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
voting
 
05:16:28.030 --> 05:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
against 1957 so we can consider the new
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment and invest in the granite
 
05:16:33.150 --> 05:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
state Working Families and most of all
 
05:16:36.190 --> 05:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
and hungry kids feeding kids is well
 
05:16:39.070 --> 05:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
worth any investment that we can make
 
05:16:42.190 --> 05:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and I request a division
 
05:16:49.230 --> 05:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:52.230 --> 05:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
torki thank you Mr
 
05:16:55.190 --> 05:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker this amendment does two things
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
one thing is good and the other is
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
nowhere near good enough which is why I
 
05:17:02.948 --> 05:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
oppose it the good part that we agree on
 
05:17:05.070 --> 05:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for seniors and people
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
with disabilities to access the
 
05:17:08.910 --> 05:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutritional nutrition
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
assistance program the part that is
 
05:17:13.948 --> 05:17:13.958 align:start position:0%
deficient is the section which
 
05:17:17.390 --> 05:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
appropriates $50,000 for DHHS to develop
 
05:17:20.548 --> 05:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
a plan to possibly Implement a summer
 
05:17:23.948 --> 05:17:23.958 align:start position:0%
EBT program sometime in the
 
05:17:27.190 --> 05:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
future we know that food insecurity has
 
05:17:29.190 --> 05:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
a negative effect on children's
 
05:17:31.390 --> 05:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
development can prevent children from
 
05:17:34.590 --> 05:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
reaching their full physical cognitive
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
and psychosocial potential and that
 
05:17:38.830 --> 05:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
these lasting effects can follow them
 
05:17:41.948 --> 05:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
well into adulthood in fact poverty and
 
05:17:44.470 --> 05:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
the food insecurity that results from it
 
05:17:47.230 --> 05:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
is one of the leading adverse childhood
 
05:17:49.708 --> 05:17:49.718 align:start position:0%
experiences that leads to Chronic health
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
problems mental illness and substance
 
05:17:56.430 --> 05:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
misuse we also know that summer is the
 
05:17:58.350 --> 05:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
time when children from low-income
 
05:18:00.750 --> 05:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
families are most food insecure because
 
05:18:02.110 --> 05:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
they cannot eat their breakfast and
 
05:18:03.548 --> 05:18:03.558 align:start position:0%
lunch at school through the free and
 
05:18:06.270 --> 05:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
reduced school lunch program if we are
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
able to implement a summer EBT program
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
each qualifying child would receive $40
 
05:18:14.110 --> 05:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
a month on an EBT card for families to
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
buy food helping to bridge the gap in
 
05:18:19.070 --> 05:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
their summertime grocery budgets to be
 
05:18:22.510 --> 05:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
clear the EBT program EBT card is for
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
food not liquor cigarettes or non-f food
 
05:18:29.788 --> 05:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
items we know based on current
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment that
 
05:18:34.590 --> 05:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
37,325 children from low income families
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
would qualify for the program if it was
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
signed into law today
 
05:18:41.868 --> 05:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
the majority Amendment appears to be a
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
step towards implementing the program
 
05:18:46.628 --> 05:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
but I want to be clear if this amendment
 
05:18:49.150 --> 05:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
passes these children will receive no
 
05:18:52.590 --> 05:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
assistance in 2024 and absolutely no
 
05:18:55.628 --> 05:18:55.638 align:start position:0%
guarantee of any assistance in 2025
 
05:18:59.628 --> 05:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
either this is our window to act get the
 
05:19:03.470 --> 05:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
program set up for the Future these kids
 
05:19:05.110 --> 05:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
who qualify come from families with
 
05:19:08.430 --> 05:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
incomes below 185% of the federal
 
05:19:10.830 --> 05:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
poverty y level this means for a single
 
05:19:13.150 --> 05:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
working parent with one child their
 
05:19:15.708 --> 05:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
household makes less than
 
05:19:18.628 --> 05:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
$38,000 for a family of four less than
 
05:19:21.350 --> 05:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
58,000 for families in this lower income
 
05:19:23.310 --> 05:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
bracket the rise in cost of things like
 
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
housing child care and utilities has
 
05:19:27.830 --> 05:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
made it increasingly difficult to meet
 
05:19:30.990 --> 05:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
basic needs like food the sponsor of
 
05:19:33.030 --> 05:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment stated in our executive
 
05:19:34.830 --> 05:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
session that he completely guessed when
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
picking the appropriation there was no
 
05:19:39.430 --> 05:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
input from the Department and the amount
 
05:19:40.708 --> 05:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
is just a fraction of what the
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
department stated is needed to build out
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
a plan for successful
 
05:19:47.070 --> 05:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
implementation by comparison the
 
05:19:48.590 --> 05:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
alternative minority Amendment which
 
05:19:50.390 --> 05:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
will be introduced next contains a
 
05:19:53.470 --> 05:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
detailed and transparent cost breakdown
 
05:19:55.070 --> 05:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
directly from the Department on what is
 
05:19:57.190 --> 05:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
needed to set up the program and start
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
getting resources to those who need it
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
making these initial Investments to get
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
the program going will allow us to
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
leverage at least $4.5 million in
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
federal money which will come back to
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
our state to be spent at our local
 
05:20:13.628 --> 05:20:13.638 align:start position:0%
stores by not participating in this
 
05:20:16.230 --> 05:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
program and leaving this money our money
 
05:20:18.750 --> 05:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
our federal tax dollars on the table it
 
05:20:20.270 --> 05:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
will simply go to children in other
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
states and New Hampshire children will
 
05:20:24.788 --> 05:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
go without please vote no on this
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
amendment so an alternative amendment
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
can be brought forward and we can
 
05:20:30.548 --> 05:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
discuss implementing a program to feed
 
05:20:33.270 --> 05:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
hungry kids now thank you Mr Speaker

05:21:18.590 --> 05:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
would become effective on passage and
 
05:21:20.590 --> 05:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
does two
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
things first it appropriates a onetime
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
setup cost of
 
05:21:31.670 --> 05:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
$37,500 to the Department of Health and
 
05:21:35.150 --> 05:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
Human Services to implement the elderly

the supplemental nutrition assistance
 
05:21:45.470 --> 05:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
program this important and much needed
 
05:21:49.470 --> 05:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
change to law will allow the elderly and
 
05:21:52.350 --> 05:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities to file every
 
05:21:55.948 --> 05:21:55.958 align:start position:0%
three years rather than annually for the
 
05:21:58.110 --> 05:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
food stamp
 
05:21:58.120 --> 05:21:59.628 align:start position:0%

program

05:21:59.628 --> 05:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:22:03.150 --> 05:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
second it allocates
 
05:22:05.628 --> 05:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
$50,000 to the Department of Health and
 
05:22:08.510 --> 05:22:08.520 align:start position:0%

developing and and implementing a plan
 
05:22:21.708 --> 05:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
the key word there is plan and that is
 
05:22:23.910 --> 05:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
the huge difference between this
 
05:22:26.910 --> 05:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and the Alternatives that wish
 
05:22:28.708 --> 05:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
to be brought
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
forward this amendment is
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
realistic and it's Frugal in its
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
approach to a new and very expansive
 
05:22:43.310 --> 05:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
program the alternatives are too fast
 
05:22:43.320 --> 05:22:44.190 align:start position:0%
program the alternatives are too fast
too

05:22:44.190 --> 05:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:22:46.868 --> 05:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
soon the house finance committee is
 
05:22:50.110 --> 05:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
charged with examining and recommending
 
05:22:50.120 --> 05:22:51.150 align:start position:0%

funds the majority agrees that this
 
05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
amendment is a reasonable alternative to
 
05:22:59.830 --> 05:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
the Omnibus Bill sent to us from the

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
05:25:02.788 --> 05:25:02.798 align:start position:0%
majority Amendment addresses only one
 
05:25:05.628 --> 05:25:05.638 align:start position:0%
small part of this important bill to
 
05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
reduce childhood and elderly hunger
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
and if I know that now is the time to
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
move forward and apply for the summer
 
05:25:17.948 --> 05:25:17.958 align:start position:0%
EBT program so that it will be in place
 
05:25:21.470 --> 05:25:21.480 align:start position:0%

Implement both the elderly simplified

application and the summer EBT program
 
05:25:48.830 --> 05:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
for children would I now vote no on this
 
05:25:51.510 --> 05:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
amendment so that a more comprehensive
 
05:25:54.070 --> 05:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
amendment can be brought forward please
 
05:25:56.030 --> 05:25:56.040 align:start position:0%

05:26:04.830 --> 05:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
05:26:07.470 --> 05:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
the bill came over from the Senate with
 
05:26:08.750 --> 05:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
12 million
 
05:26:11.830 --> 05:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
in Appropriations or an estimate but
 
05:26:14.510 --> 05:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
only funded less than $500,000 of that
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
leaving the house to find the difference
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
if I know that the house looked through
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
the various portions of this bill and
 
05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
determined one was worth funding
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
directly and one was worth looking at
 
05:26:26.990 --> 05:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
and investigating and
 
05:26:29.310 --> 05:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
funding if I know that the total cost
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
was $887,000 to do both of those items
 
05:26:34.150 --> 05:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
which would be fit within this year's
 
05:26:36.150 --> 05:26:36.160 align:start position:0%

afternoon once more to my colleagues I
 
05:28:32.590 --> 05:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
Rise now against the committee amendment
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
to Senate bill or the amendment rather
 
05:28:38.750 --> 05:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
to Senate Bill 499 it's numbered 19
 
05:28:43.788 --> 05:28:43.798 align:start position:0%
1917 h on page 74 of your house calendar
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
now this amendment does maintain the
 
05:28:49.948 --> 05:28:49.958 align:start position:0%
much needed one-time setup cost of
 
05:28:53.230 --> 05:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
$37,500 to the Department of Health and
 
05:28:56.430 --> 05:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
Human Services to implement the elderly
 
05:29:00.030 --> 05:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
simplified application project within
 
05:29:03.390 --> 05:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
snap and also that's to help uh the
 
05:29:05.868 --> 05:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
elderly and those with disabilities to
 
05:29:08.948 --> 05:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
file every three years rather than
 
05:29:11.350 --> 05:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
annually for the food stamp program that
 
05:29:13.708 --> 05:29:13.718 align:start position:0%
is very important and I think the whole
 
05:29:15.750 --> 05:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee thought so because it
 
05:29:19.150 --> 05:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
is in both amendments proposed to you
 
05:29:23.310 --> 05:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
today however this amendment number
 
05:29:28.910 --> 05:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
1917 H overall spends too much too soon
 
05:29:31.670 --> 05:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
on a new federal summer Electronics
 
05:29:35.430 --> 05:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
benefit transfer program for children
 
05:29:39.628 --> 05:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
that cannot start this summer
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
now this amendment also puts a temporary
 
05:29:46.110 --> 05:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
program in place initially but then
 
05:29:49.590 --> 05:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
requires additional funds the following
 
05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
year I'm going to break down the
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
expenditures in this
 
05:29:54.638 --> 05:29:57.628 align:start position:0%
expenditures in this
amendment

05:29:57.628 --> 05:29:57.638 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:30:00.910 --> 05:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
$143,000 for personnel costs to the

$55,000 for funding Systems and

Technology in the first
 
05:30:17.910 --> 05:30:17.920 align:start position:0%

the second
 
05:30:29.910 --> 05:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
year the transactional fees for
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
82,500 each summer for the next two
 
05:30:38.270 --> 05:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
years a $10,000 fee for one time time
 
05:30:42.350 --> 05:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
setup costs and then a
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
$25,000 cost for
 
05:30:45.200 --> 05:30:47.390 align:start position:0%
$25,000 cost for
funding

05:30:47.390 --> 05:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
funding
 
05:30:49.788 --> 05:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
Outreach it was mentioned that federal
 
05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
funds are available but the maximum
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
federal funding amount is conditional on
 
05:31:01.390 --> 05:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
all recipients of free and reduced lunch
 
05:31:03.350 --> 05:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
participating the
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
total is too much right now for a new
 
05:31:11.948 --> 05:31:11.958 align:start position:0%
program and the federal funding is too
 
05:31:16.030 --> 05:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
indefinite to rely on the bottom line is
 
05:31:18.708 --> 05:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
this amendment is Not Practical and it
 
05:31:21.990 --> 05:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
is not Frugal in its approach during an
 
05:31:25.830 --> 05:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
off budget year the majority of the
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
house finance committee agrees that a
 
05:31:33.670 --> 05:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
program of this size of this cost cannot
 
05:31:37.948 --> 05:31:37.958 align:start position:0%
be rushed or overspent upon and this
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
this amendment does both please join the
 
05:31:46.548 --> 05:31:46.558 align:start position:0%

Speaker the previous debate outlined
 
05:32:10.470 --> 05:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
many the details so I'll be brief
 
05:32:14.948 --> 05:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1917 h on page 74 of your
 
05:32:17.310 --> 05:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
calendar directs the department to
 
05:32:19.270 --> 05:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
participate in the federal summer EBT
 
05:32:20.788 --> 05:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
program and the elderly simplified
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
application for SNAP I'd like to be
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
clear that the bipartisan bill that came
 
05:32:28.548 --> 05:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
to us with the unanimous vote from the
 
05:32:31.590 --> 05:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
other side was far more expansive than
 
05:32:33.990 --> 05:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
what we have today this amendment
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
removes all sections related to the
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and deals with
 
05:32:44.310 --> 05:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
only two programs under the direction of
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS the majority of the $1.1 million
 
05:32:50.868 --> 05:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
appropriation will be for the one-time
 
05:32:54.548 --> 05:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
startup costs and once summer EBT and
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
the simplified applications are up and
 
05:32:58.110 --> 05:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
running there will be minimal
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
administrative cost to keep the program
 
05:33:03.510 --> 05:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
going yes because the effective date is
 
05:33:06.590 --> 05:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
July 1 a program for summer food
 
05:33:08.788 --> 05:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
assistance can't start and be fully
 
05:33:10.830 --> 05:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
functioning on July
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
2 however the benefits that are
 
05:33:17.628 --> 05:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
designated for 2024 will still come into
 
05:33:20.270 --> 05:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
our state they will just be delayed and
 
05:33:22.110 --> 05:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
arrive in early
 
05:33:25.628 --> 05:33:25.638 align:start position:0%
fall and with the system up and running
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
we will be ready to go as intended for
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
the 2025
 
05:33:33.590 --> 05:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
year we already heard $45 million doll
 
05:33:34.910 --> 05:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
will come into our state with the
 
05:33:36.628 --> 05:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
program and it's estimated to have an
 
05:33:41.510 --> 05:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
economic imp impa equivalent of $6.7 to8
 
05:33:44.190 --> 05:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
million not only is it good for our
 
05:33:47.430 --> 05:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
economy but it's also good for our
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
kids getting assistance to food insecure
 
05:33:52.670 --> 05:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
families in the summer months can be the
 
05:33:54.990 --> 05:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
difference for kids as they grow learn
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
and become positive contributing members
 
05:34:01.230 --> 05:34:01.240 align:start position:0%

05:40:01.510 --> 05:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
same language from hb1

1466 that was passed unanimously out of

05:40:09.070 --> 05:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
Edna and house finance and then
 
05:40:17.070 --> 05:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:20.150 --> 05:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
body uh okay
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
um the language creates a statutory
 
05:40:25.030 --> 05:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle for the state to financially
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
help a municipality right after a
 
05:40:27.600 --> 05:40:29.110 align:start position:0%
help a municipality right after a
natural

05:40:29.110 --> 05:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
natural
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
disaster no such Authority exists now
 
05:40:35.070 --> 05:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
and no appropriation of funds are
 
05:40:38.628 --> 05:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
necessary now I don't know about you but
 
05:40:40.788 --> 05:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
I don't appreciate this important bill
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
being dismissed or ignored by the other
 
05:40:46.510 --> 05:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
body and I was told that our position on
 
05:40:48.750 --> 05:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
assisting municipalities in their time
 
05:40:52.670 --> 05:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
of need didn't matter and that despite
 
05:40:54.910 --> 05:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
not needing any money appropriated at
 
05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
this time and since it's an off-budget
 
05:41:01.830 --> 05:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
year this would have to wait I don't
 
05:41:03.948 --> 05:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
think we should wait when we can do this
 
05:41:06.270 --> 05:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
now and I think we need to send the
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
message to the other body that we are
 
05:41:13.230 --> 05:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
serious about disaster relief and they
 
05:41:14.270 --> 05:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:41:16.990 --> 05:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
too please join me in supporting this
 
05:41:19.270 --> 05:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment and helping out our
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker this amendment does
 
05:47:45.120 --> 05:47:46.110 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker this amendment does
two

05:47:46.110 --> 05:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:47:49.868 --> 05:47:49.878 align:start position:0%
things one it reduces the percentage of
 
05:47:53.948 --> 05:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
the public deposit in investment pool
 
05:47:57.150 --> 05:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
that is subject to the underlying Bill
 
05:48:01.628 --> 05:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
and two it sets a Sunset date for that
 
05:48:06.990 --> 05:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill in in in so doing I believe it a a
 
05:48:09.390 --> 05:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
knowledges that the bill is
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
overreaching and
 
05:48:14.350 --> 05:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but the amendment is better
 
05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
than the underlying bill and I ask you
 
05:48:20.110 --> 05:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
to please support the amendment so we
 
05:48:23.670 --> 05:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
can move on and defeat the amended bill
 
05:48:28.830 --> 05:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.548 --> 05:48:32.558 align:start position:0%

05:49:17.230 --> 05:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr speaker thank you I
 
05:49:21.070 --> 05:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
rise in opposition to this bill as this
 
05:49:23.430 --> 05:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
is not a Republican bill this is not a
 
05:49:27.910 --> 05:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
democratic bill this is a municipal bill
 
05:49:31.990 --> 05:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
which will take money from the
 
05:49:34.430 --> 05:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities now what they're asking
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
you to do is to take a percentage of
 
05:49:42.190 --> 05:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
money and put it into a State Bank
 
05:49:45.670 --> 05:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
Chartered bank or whatever so that it's
 
05:49:49.150 --> 05:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
invested inside the return on this
 
05:49:52.510 --> 05:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
investment which everybody here
 
05:49:54.430 --> 05:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
understands what the return on your
 
05:49:58.350 --> 05:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
personal investment is you rely on that
 
05:50:01.230 --> 05:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
return I can speak for lonia because
 
05:50:04.590 --> 05:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
I've been in good conversations with our
 
05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
finance director and what this does is
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
it lowers the threshold of return on
 
05:50:16.230 --> 05:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
that investment if you looked at your
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
own savings accounts from all the banks
 
05:50:21.230 --> 05:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
that you've got your money tied up in
 
05:50:23.708 --> 05:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
can you honestly answer you're getting
 
05:50:28.430 --> 05:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
the best return for your money I think
 
05:50:32.030 --> 05:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
not but in this case they can invest it
 
05:50:35.190 --> 05:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
in this PP fund and what that enables
 
05:50:38.468 --> 05:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
them to do is get a larger return on
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
their investment now speaking for
 
05:50:46.390 --> 05:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:50.110 --> 05:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
$200,000 now that's not chump change and
 
05:50:53.750 --> 05:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
what happens is that money helps to
 
05:50:57.750 --> 05:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
offset the property tax that is required
 
05:51:01.948 --> 05:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
of the residents to pay for the city
 
05:51:04.830 --> 05:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
budget this also rolls into County
 
05:51:06.750 --> 05:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
budgets where the county budget it's
 
05:51:09.750 --> 05:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to be tied into this same type of
 
05:51:12.510 --> 05:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
format so if they're investing in a p
 
05:51:15.430 --> 05:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
dip then they're going to start to lose
 
05:51:18.750 --> 05:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
some of the money that is involved in
 
05:51:22.830 --> 05:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
this a city and a town no matter which
 
05:51:26.868 --> 05:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
size it is they only have limited
 
05:51:30.310 --> 05:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
resources for
 
05:51:34.708 --> 05:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
revenue and if you take away another way
 
05:51:37.350 --> 05:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
they could take advantage of improving a
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
revenue Source then there's only one way
 
05:51:43.150 --> 05:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
to make up the money it's automatically
 
05:51:45.190 --> 05:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
going to come from the
 
05:51:48.270 --> 05:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer now I don't know that that
 
05:51:53.868 --> 05:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
makes sound business sense to sit and
 
05:51:57.910 --> 05:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
say you can only invest in what we're
 
05:52:00.150 --> 05:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
going to tell you to invest in from a
 
05:52:05.150 --> 05:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
state level and why a local city our
 
05:52:07.628 --> 05:52:07.638 align:start position:0%
town our municipal ality whichever you
 
05:52:10.430 --> 05:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
want to look at it can make that choice
 
05:52:12.270 --> 05:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
on how they want to take their fund
 
05:52:16.350 --> 05:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
balance and invest it for the best of
 
05:52:16.360 --> 05:52:18.110 align:start position:0%
balance and invest it for the best of
their

05:52:18.110 --> 05:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:52:20.230 --> 05:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
constituents and that's what it's all
 
05:52:22.910 --> 05:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
about not the bankers
 
05:52:26.430 --> 05:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
Association this is strictly property
 
05:52:31.070 --> 05:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
tax business so please oppose this bill
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
in every way shape or form the amendment
 
05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
made a bad Bill a little better but the
 
05:52:40.868 --> 05:52:40.878 align:start position:0%

05:54:21.468 --> 05:54:21.478 align:start position:0%
date for the bill and in so doing it
 
05:54:24.350 --> 05:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that the bill is
 
05:54:27.830 --> 05:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
overreaching damaging and
 
05:54:30.190 --> 05:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary all of the
 
05:54:33.390 --> 05:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
uses of the pool that we heard from
 
05:54:36.468 --> 05:54:36.478 align:start position:0%
oppose the law due to the likely
 
05:54:39.190 --> 05:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
deterioration of their investment
 
05:54:42.110 --> 05:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
returns and as we all just heard from
 
05:54:46.230 --> 05:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
the last speaker those returns are used
 
05:54:50.230 --> 05:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
to lower the property tax in our
 
05:54:52.910 --> 05:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and lowering the tax in
 
05:54:52.920 --> 05:54:54.030 align:start position:0%
municipalities and lowering the tax in
our

05:54:54.030 --> 05:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:54:56.830 --> 05:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
counties in
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
2023 the law was amended to remove the
 
05:55:02.628 --> 05:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
trust from the banking commissioner's
 
05:55:06.510 --> 05:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
office and place it under the oversight
 
05:55:09.468 --> 05:55:09.478 align:start position:0%
of our very capable State
 
05:55:13.190 --> 05:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
Treasurer in committee she testified
 
05:55:16.390 --> 05:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
that the trust was not broken and was
 
05:55:18.230 --> 05:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
working well for its
 
05:55:22.030 --> 05:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
uses she also testified that in the few
 
05:55:24.830 --> 05:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
months since she took over and her
 
05:55:26.510 --> 05:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
office have been working with the
 
05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
trust's advisory committees reviewing
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
and developing policies and objectives
 
05:55:34.270 --> 05:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:55:38.310 --> 05:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
pool the legisl should let that process
 
05:55:41.030 --> 05:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
play out without
 
05:55:45.390 --> 05:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
mandating a geographical constraint on
 
05:55:48.910 --> 05:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
that process that limits the pool's
 
05:55:51.788 --> 05:55:51.798 align:start position:0%
returns please support the Judgment of
 
05:55:55.510 --> 05:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
your County city and town
 
05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
treasurers by pressing the red button
 
05:56:02.030 --> 05:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
and defeating this motion so a motion of
 
05:56:06.910 --> 05:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
interim study can be made for this bill
 
05:56:10.230 --> 05:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
as written and it can go to a peaceful
 
05:56:10.240 --> 05:56:13.310 align:start position:0%
as written and it can go to a peaceful
quiet

05:56:13.310 --> 05:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:16.110 --> 05:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
death thank you representative grass's
 
05:56:20.830 --> 05:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:23.830 --> 05:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker I write in
 
05:56:27.070 --> 05:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
in opposition to HB 553 I think that the
 
05:56:28.468 --> 05:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
last two speakers that you've had have
 
05:56:30.350 --> 05:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much laid out most of the facts
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with this the public investment
 
05:56:34.430 --> 05:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
pool has been around for quite a while
 
05:56:37.110 --> 05:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's an option for communities again
 
05:56:39.390 --> 05:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's an option for communities they can
 
05:56:41.110 --> 05:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
invest in their local banks or they can
 
05:56:43.788 --> 05:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
invest in the pool one of the things
 
05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
that that people don't think of is a lot
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the bigger cities you have your own
 
05:56:49.110 --> 05:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
investment advisors we have a finance
 
05:56:50.990 --> 05:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
director in Rochester and we invest most
 
05:56:52.670 --> 05:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
of our money in local
 
05:56:55.150 --> 05:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
banks but smaller communities don't have
 
05:56:55.160 --> 05:56:55.948 align:start position:0%
banks but smaller communities don't have
that

05:56:55.948 --> 05:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:56:57.910 --> 05:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity some of you know me you know
 
05:56:59.150 --> 05:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
that I worked in a number of small
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
communities here in the state of New
 
05:57:01.788 --> 05:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've worked with a number
 
05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
of the administrators public
 
05:57:04.548 --> 05:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
administrators Town administrators
 
05:57:07.430 --> 05:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
County administrators as well
 
05:57:09.868 --> 05:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
their position has been that they have
 
05:57:11.830 --> 05:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
not been involved in this
 
05:57:14.110 --> 05:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
process this bill sort of was fast
 
05:57:15.910 --> 05:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
tracked on the other side of the wall
 
05:57:18.110 --> 05:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
got over here and the administrators in
 
05:57:19.270 --> 05:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
fact I was sitting home on a Sunday
 
05:57:20.590 --> 05:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon and I get a call from a Town
 
05:57:22.670 --> 05:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
Administrator saying are you aware of
 
05:57:24.548 --> 05:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
this bill and I said not
 
05:57:27.310 --> 05:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
really what is this doing and he says
 
05:57:28.590 --> 05:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
05:57:31.628 --> 05:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
sure but it doesn't sound good because
 
05:57:33.910 --> 05:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
right now we are investing in the pool
 
05:57:35.788 --> 05:57:35.798 align:start position:0%
and we are making good money we have
 
05:57:39.430 --> 05:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
never lost a dime never lost a not even
 
05:57:42.150 --> 05:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
a penny never lost a penny in the public
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
investment pool and it currently they're
 
05:57:46.830 --> 05:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
earning a better rate that they can get
 
05:57:48.628 --> 05:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and that's something that
 
05:57:52.510 --> 05:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:55.868 --> 05:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
communities when we take a look at the
 
05:57:57.150 --> 05:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
05:57:59.708 --> 05:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
amended you you may hear and discussion
 
05:58:01.150 --> 05:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
about the original bill was how this was
 
05:58:02.030 --> 05:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
all this money was going to be
 
05:58:03.628 --> 05:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
reinvested back into the state of New
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and be a benefit to the
 
05:58:07.708 --> 05:58:07.718 align:start position:0%
communities and the dollar the way it
 
05:58:09.830 --> 05:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
gets transferred in and out of the state
 
05:58:11.510 --> 05:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
or in within the state it's going to
 
05:58:12.868 --> 05:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
make more revenues for the state well
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
the bill has been amended and it
 
05:58:16.628 --> 05:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
actually does very little because it
 
05:58:18.350 --> 05:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
says we shall
 
05:58:21.548 --> 05:58:21.558 align:start position:0%
aspire to 30% it doesn't say we shall
 
05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
have 30% invested in the state but we
 
05:58:26.070 --> 05:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
shall aspire to
 
05:58:28.468 --> 05:58:28.478 align:start position:0%
30% again as you heard from the previous
 
05:58:30.190 --> 05:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
speaker the banking commissioner said
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
that she has been working with the
 
05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
Advisory board about this bill you
 
05:58:38.708 --> 05:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
about the trust and what they would like
 
05:58:40.590 --> 05:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
to do with this pool is they would like
 
05:58:43.948 --> 05:58:43.958 align:start position:0%
to take more time and work on it and
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
have the and develop the policy and
 
05:58:47.750 --> 05:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
develop the rules for Investments
 
05:58:49.468 --> 05:58:49.478 align:start position:0%
they're working on that right now this
 
05:58:52.468 --> 05:58:52.478 align:start position:0%
bill would throw that all
 
05:58:57.190 --> 05:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
out when I spoke to the treasurer when
 
05:58:59.270 --> 05:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment came up and we were told
 
05:59:02.430 --> 05:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
this is a compromise amendment that we
 
05:59:04.750 --> 05:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
have it was a compromise between the
 
05:59:06.868 --> 05:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
bankers and the treasurer
 
05:59:10.150 --> 05:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
the investors were never involved nobody
 
05:59:13.430 --> 05:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
asked the town administrators the
 
05:59:15.548 --> 05:59:15.558 align:start position:0%
finance directors the trust fund
 
05:59:18.230 --> 05:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
administrators the county administrators
 
05:59:19.628 --> 05:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
those people who are responsible for our
 
05:59:20.910 --> 05:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
local communities and counties were
 
05:59:23.910 --> 05:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
never involved in any negotiations on
 
05:59:27.590 --> 05:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:29.708 --> 05:59:29.718 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm asking you to stand with
 
05:59:32.270 --> 05:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
your local communities right now and
 
05:59:35.230 --> 05:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
vote no on this and allow us to send
 
05:59:37.070 --> 05:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
this to inim St study so that we can
 
05:59:38.830 --> 05:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
take a good look at this bill we can
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
work with the town administrators and
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
Trust advisers and and any everyone else
 
05:59:46.708 --> 05:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
in the state that invest in this pool to
 
05:59:48.788 --> 05:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
do what is best for the taxpayers in our
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
community thank
 
05:59:53.590 --> 05:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
you representative sweene is recognized
 
05:59:58.350 --> 05:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:00.548 --> 06:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
06:00:02.830 --> 06:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker a as everyone else has said
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
already Senate Bill 553 came to us in
 
06:00:07.990 --> 06:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
house Finance radically different than
 
06:00:10.390 --> 06:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
what is presented to us today after we
 
06:00:13.230 --> 06:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
adopted the committee Amendment Senate
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 553 the title there is requiring
 
06:00:18.430 --> 06:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
that funds held by the public investment
 
06:00:20.510 --> 06:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
public deposit investment pool be
 
06:00:22.548 --> 06:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
invested in New Hampshire however the
 
06:00:24.468 --> 06:00:24.478 align:start position:0%
amendment that we adopted uh on a Voice
 
06:00:26.948 --> 06:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
vote just minutes ago really does
 
06:00:28.750 --> 06:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
rewrite the bill to make it a
 
06:00:31.868 --> 06:00:31.878 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that we encourage the
 
06:00:35.670 --> 06:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
investment advisor to invest 30% of the
 
06:00:39.310 --> 06:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
fund Fund in insured or collateralized
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
Investments currently 0 of the public
 
06:00:45.628 --> 06:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool is insured or
 
06:00:47.990 --> 06:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
collateralized zero dollars of the
 
06:00:50.590 --> 06:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
public deposit investment pool of all of
 
06:00:52.390 --> 06:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
our taxpayer dollars in the various
 
06:00:54.270 --> 06:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
communities that are investing in it
 
06:00:56.270 --> 06:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
zero of those dollars are invested in
 
06:00:58.350 --> 06:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire this
 
06:01:00.190 --> 06:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
amendment the the bill that is now been
 
06:01:02.708 --> 06:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
amended provides a vehicle for us to
 
06:01:05.070 --> 06:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
move that direction but the One
 
06:01:07.830 --> 06:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
requirement in the bill still is to
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
achieve the highest attainable stable
 
06:01:13.468 --> 06:01:13.478 align:start position:0%
rating for local taxpayer dollars in
 
06:01:15.510 --> 06:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
that investment pool so while we are
 
06:01:17.788 --> 06:01:17.798 align:start position:0%
encouraging more of the pool to be
 
06:01:20.548 --> 06:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
insured and collateralized to be in the
 
06:01:23.868 --> 06:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we are requiring
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
that highest attainable rating still be
 
06:01:28.708 --> 06:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
pursued as the main priority for the
 
06:01:31.230 --> 06:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
public deposit investment pool otherwise
 
06:01:33.548 --> 06:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
known as Peta obviously there was a lot
 
06:01:35.628 --> 06:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
of work put into this bill uh there was
 
06:01:38.070 --> 06:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
a a lot of in uh Insight from the
 
06:01:40.350 --> 06:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that were involved we tried
 
06:01:42.190 --> 06:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
to make the bill work I believe we
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
achieved that uh and we put into a
 
06:01:47.590 --> 06:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
sunset of 2030 so that a future
 
06:01:50.310 --> 06:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
legislature can see what changes to the
 
06:01:51.990 --> 06:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
public deposit investment pool that
 
06:01:54.270 --> 06:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
mouthful of a term I've now said 20
 
06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
times in one speech we can see what
 
06:01:58.750 --> 06:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
changes are made to that investment pool
 
06:02:01.350 --> 06:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
over the next seven years and make and a
 
06:02:03.150 --> 06:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
future legislature can make further
 
06:02:05.190 --> 06:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
adjustments go back to the way things
 
06:02:06.390 --> 06:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
are today
 
06:02:08.190 --> 06:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
but the biggest takeaway from this bill
 
06:02:10.390 --> 06:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
is if this bill passes and is signed
 
06:02:12.510 --> 06:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
into law by the governor the public
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool is the same as
 
06:02:17.868 --> 06:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
it is today as it will be tomorrow it
 
06:02:20.030 --> 06:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
does not it it creates that legislative
 
06:02:22.430 --> 06:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
intent to encourage more insured or
 
06:02:23.948 --> 06:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
collateralized investments in the state
 
06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh and I would urge you
 
06:02:29.110 --> 06:02:29.120 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
06:04:24.868 --> 06:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
upsets policy that has worked
 
06:04:28.590 --> 06:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
beautifully for over 30 years and
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
invested funds has risen to nearly $700
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
million and if I know that our
 
06:04:39.230 --> 06:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities counties and school
 
06:04:42.350 --> 06:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
districts rely on the interest from the
 
06:04:46.468 --> 06:04:46.478 align:start position:0%
fund to pay their expenses and moderate
 
06:04:46.478 --> 06:04:47.830 align:start position:0%

property
 
06:04:51.990 --> 06:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
taxes if I know that no actual user of
 
06:04:54.830 --> 06:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
this fund wants it to
 
06:04:58.708 --> 06:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
change and finally if I know that 30% of
 
06:05:02.430 --> 06:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
a bad idea is still a bad
 
06:05:06.070 --> 06:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
idea would I now press the red button
 
06:05:08.548 --> 06:05:08.558 align:start position:0%

yeah so there's no yelling I don't like
 
06:09:01.510 --> 06:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
being yelled at if somebody has a
 
06:09:04.310 --> 06:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate point of order which is when
 
06:09:06.830 --> 06:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
we are not following our own rules or
 
06:09:08.990 --> 06:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
procedures then you can come down to the
 
06:09:11.548 --> 06:09:11.558 align:start position:0%

06:09:14.468 --> 06:09:14.478 align:start position:0%

06:09:18.868 --> 06:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
unable to agree with the majority Report
 
06:09:20.270 --> 06:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
with the recommendation that the bill
 
06:09:21.990 --> 06:09:22.000 align:start position:0%

at the Youth Development Center the bill
 
06:14:14.430 --> 06:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
makes numerous changes in claims
 
06:14:16.788 --> 06:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
procedures definitions and scope of

conduct covered under the administrative

legislation the ability of the state
 
06:14:36.150 --> 06:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
treasurer with with the approval of the

additional funds are needed that is
 
06:14:50.190 --> 06:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
adequate assurance that the decision to
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
bond would be well
 
06:14:55.150 --> 06:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
founded the amendment came to the
 
06:14:58.110 --> 06:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
committee at the executive session with
 
06:15:01.190 --> 06:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
no further input and no one had really
 
06:15:04.110 --> 06:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
seen it before it came and there was no
 
06:15:06.548 --> 06:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
consultation with the attorney general
 
06:15:08.868 --> 06:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
about the effect of the deletion of the
 
06:15:12.110 --> 06:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
ability to bond and what uh effect it
 
06:15:13.990 --> 06:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
would have on the settlement fund and
 
06:15:16.750 --> 06:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
the carefully crafted negotiations with
 
06:15:19.708 --> 06:15:19.718 align:start position:0%
the claimant Council we really should
 
06:15:22.190 --> 06:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
not be hampering with the attorney
 
06:15:26.270 --> 06:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
general or the state's ability to do its
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
best in this unbelievably challenging
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
situation this amendment should not be
 
06:15:35.390 --> 06:15:35.400 align:start position:0%

quickly to the governor's desk as it
 
06:15:58.390 --> 06:15:58.400 align:start position:0%

06:15:59.910 --> 06:15:59.920 align:start position:0%

Speaker this is a 20page bill that
 
06:16:13.270 --> 06:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
modifies the YDC settlement Fund in
 
06:16:16.948 --> 06:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
various ways we heard in committee that
 
06:16:19.948 --> 06:16:19.958 align:start position:0%
the total amount of the settlement that
 
06:16:21.788 --> 06:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
the state is going to be obligated to
 
06:16:24.110 --> 06:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
pay is roughly
 
06:16:24.120 --> 06:16:26.628 align:start position:0%
pay is roughly
$750

06:16:26.628 --> 06:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
$750
 
06:16:30.110 --> 06:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
million 500 million of that to victims
 
06:16:33.510 --> 06:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
and 250 million to their
 
06:16:37.110 --> 06:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys the Bill itself has us pay
 
06:16:41.110 --> 06:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
this on the installment plan we will be
 
06:16:46.590 --> 06:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay $75 million per year
 
06:16:49.230 --> 06:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
essentially for the next
 
06:16:52.750 --> 06:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
decade um we have already allocated $100
 
06:16:57.150 --> 06:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
million to the fund um of that 85
 
06:16:59.948 --> 06:16:59.958 align:start position:0%
million have been spent so that leaves
 
06:17:02.868 --> 06:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
15 million for next year this bill
 
06:17:06.350 --> 06:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
allocates another 60 so that's our our
 
06:17:08.788 --> 06:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
75 million to carry us through the end
 
06:17:11.270 --> 06:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
of this bium through next
 
06:17:14.350 --> 06:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
July a year from
 
06:17:17.270 --> 06:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
July the only dispute on this bill
 
06:17:19.948 --> 06:17:19.958 align:start position:0%
between the majority and the minority is
 
06:17:23.070 --> 06:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
over this amendment this amendment
 
06:17:26.868 --> 06:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
removes one paragraph from the
 
06:17:29.548 --> 06:17:29.558 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
06:17:33.708 --> 06:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
paragraph says that we may borrow our
 
06:17:38.750 --> 06:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:41.830 --> 06:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
commitment by paying victims in
 
06:17:45.628 --> 06:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
installments we are already borrowing
 
06:17:49.230 --> 06:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
the bulk of this money and paying the
 
06:17:54.468 --> 06:17:54.478 align:start position:0%
victims 5% interest while we pay them
 
06:17:59.390 --> 06:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
off to borrow further our annual
 
06:18:02.230 --> 06:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
installment is not the kind of uh
 
06:18:02.240 --> 06:18:03.350 align:start position:0%
installment is not the kind of uh
Financial

06:18:03.350 --> 06:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
06:18:06.548 --> 06:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
shenanigans that should take place in
 
06:18:09.390 --> 06:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
conquered that's something more suitable
 
06:18:13.868 --> 06:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:18.910 --> 06:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
DC debt is great for capital projects
 
06:18:23.750 --> 06:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
but it is not good for annual
 
06:18:26.310 --> 06:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
expenses such as this
 
06:18:29.590 --> 06:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
one and specifically to the point of
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
discussing this change with the attorney
 
06:18:35.750 --> 06:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
general I did following our hearing
 
06:18:39.190 --> 06:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
speak to the attorney Assistant Attorney
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
General um who who oversees the
 
06:18:45.350 --> 06:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
settlement Fund in this particular
 
06:18:49.750 --> 06:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
case and this will not upset the
 
06:18:52.350 --> 06:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
agreements that they have had with the
 
06:18:56.310 --> 06:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
other side the main purpose of this bill
 
06:19:00.868 --> 06:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
is to encourage the claimants to use the
 
06:19:04.510 --> 06:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
settlement process get us out of court
 
06:19:07.788 --> 06:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
as as much as possible and pay them off
 
06:19:10.948 --> 06:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
on a schedule that the state can
 
06:19:12.830 --> 06:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
afford but
 
06:19:17.390 --> 06:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
to but to pile debt on top of debt is
 
06:19:21.990 --> 06:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
simply wrong let's pay our way as we go
 
06:19:25.110 --> 06:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
and remove further borrowing from this
 
06:19:27.390 --> 06:19:27.400 align:start position:0%

suggestions that we just heard but this
 
06:20:52.548 --> 06:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
bill came to us from the Senate after
 
06:20:56.030 --> 06:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
careful consideration and consultation
 
06:20:57.868 --> 06:20:57.878 align:start position:0%

zero and this last minute Amendment did
 
06:21:17.430 --> 06:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:17.440 --> 06:21:20.190 align:start position:0%
 
the

06:21:20.190 --> 06:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:24.430 --> 06:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
approach be ready to tell me what got
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
violated Mr Speaker I don't think you
 
06:21:28.830 --> 06:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
violated anything is this supposed to be
 
06:21:31.350 --> 06:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
a pi it is supposed to be a pi I didn't
 
06:21:33.830 --> 06:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
hear if I know I didn't hear anything
 
06:21:35.070 --> 06:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
like that
 
06:21:36.750 --> 06:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure representative lean will be
 
06:21:39.390 --> 06:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
more diligent to that as he goes forward
 
06:21:42.110 --> 06:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr
 
06:21:46.390 --> 06:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker and finally Mr Speaker again if
 
06:21:49.350 --> 06:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
I know that this last minute Amendment
 
06:21:51.510 --> 06:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
did not come to division one of the full
 
06:21:53.750 --> 06:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee for a review and
 
06:21:56.350 --> 06:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
consultation with the attorney general
 
06:22:00.230 --> 06:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I vote no Mr Speaker so this
 
06:22:02.070 --> 06:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill could come back without this
 
06:22:06.868 --> 06:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:09.468 --> 06:22:09.478 align:start position:0%
another point of order I violate the
 
06:22:11.910 --> 06:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
rules every time there's a pi by not
 
06:22:14.468 --> 06:22:14.478 align:start position:0%
answering their
 
06:22:16.468 --> 06:22:16.478 align:start position:0%
questions representative wer is
 
06:22:19.070 --> 06:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
recognized for parliamentary inquiry by
 
06:22:20.750 --> 06:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
the way well done representative gadner
 
06:22:22.110 --> 06:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
that was a proper point of order
 
06:22:26.190 --> 06:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:29.910 --> 06:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
class thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
06:22:31.670 --> 06:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
that Appropriations bills are sent to
 
06:22:33.750 --> 06:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
the finance committee because of our
 
06:22:36.030 --> 06:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
devotion to balancing the budget and
 
06:22:39.230 --> 06:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
fitting the demands to the supply then
 
06:22:40.868 --> 06:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
would I now support the amendment

position on this bill and this amendment
 
06:25:55.310 --> 06:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
um it does not create a new program but
 
06:25:58.270 --> 06:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
instead expands an existing initiative
 
06:26:01.070 --> 06:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
in the child care scholarship program to
 
06:26:03.868 --> 06:26:03.878 align:start position:0%
address the growing Gap in access to
 
06:26:06.030 --> 06:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
child care that children with
 
06:26:09.030 --> 06:26:09.040 align:start position:0%

Health and Human Services already has
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
rules govering this program making the
 
06:26:19.628 --> 06:26:19.638 align:start position:0%
need for a study committee
 
06:26:21.670 --> 06:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary the committee heard
 
06:26:24.030 --> 06:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that this program is
 
06:26:27.310 --> 06:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
underutilized because formal diagnosis
 
06:26:30.910 --> 06:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
in very young children is difficult and
 
06:26:33.708 --> 06:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
lengthy the minority recognizes the
 
06:26:36.468 --> 06:26:36.478 align:start position:0%
immediate need to ensure young children
 
06:26:39.628 --> 06:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
with disabilities have the same access
 
06:26:42.708 --> 06:26:42.718 align:start position:0%

peers Senate Bill
 
06:26:47.708 --> 06:26:47.718 align:start position:0%
596 will allow for the use of
 
06:26:49.510 --> 06:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
Developmental screening tools to
 
06:26:52.150 --> 06:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
identify to identify the special needs
 
06:26:55.190 --> 06:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
of young children in child care these
 
06:26:58.430 --> 06:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
screening tools will provide valuable
 
06:27:01.150 --> 06:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
information and resources to the child

06:27:17.510 --> 06:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
the children will develop the rules
 
06:27:20.628 --> 06:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
around the expansion of the program a
 
06:27:24.270 --> 06:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
study committee is not needed to do this
 
06:27:26.948 --> 06:27:26.958 align:start position:0%
work there are existing federal funds
 
06:27:29.190 --> 06:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
available to support the expansion
 
06:27:32.150 --> 06:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
initiative and please vote no on the
 
06:27:35.030 --> 06:27:35.040 align:start position:0%

06:27:56.510 --> 06:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:59.708 --> 06:27:59.718 align:start position:0%
amendment uh thank you Mr Speaker um I
 
06:28:03.468 --> 06:28:03.478 align:start position:0%
Rise to uh advocate for the study Comm
 
06:28:07.670 --> 06:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee the amendment being um 2024
 
06:28:12.150 --> 06:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
1933 H the study committee uh is is
 
06:28:14.868 --> 06:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate because uh the majority
 
06:28:16.910 --> 06:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
believes that the expansion of this
 
06:28:20.948 --> 06:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
program is being rushed it was initially
 
06:28:24.788 --> 06:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
a late bill from the Senate it it it got
 
06:28:28.070 --> 06:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
filed after normal hours then it went to
 
06:28:30.030 --> 06:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
our education committee out a committee
 
06:28:32.510 --> 06:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
that was an 11 to n vote so it wasn't an
 
06:28:35.190 --> 06:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelming vote there and when it got
 
06:28:38.990 --> 06:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
to uh division three uh we we took
 
06:28:42.270 --> 06:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and what we found out is that
 
06:28:45.310 --> 06:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
the reality of what this bill would do
 
06:28:48.270 --> 06:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
is different from what The Advocates say
 
06:28:52.390 --> 06:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
it would do The Advocates are very uh
 
06:28:54.830 --> 06:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
much interested in getting the extra
 
06:28:58.430 --> 06:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
$100 a month per student or not per
 
06:29:01.628 --> 06:29:01.638 align:start position:0%
student per kid into the child care
 
06:29:04.150 --> 06:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
setting um and that's and that's B
 
06:29:06.628 --> 06:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
basically the purpose of this bill is to
 
06:29:10.788 --> 06:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
get the extra $100 a month per kid into
 
06:29:13.390 --> 06:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
the child care setting now how do they
 
06:29:15.468 --> 06:29:15.478 align:start position:0%
do that well they
 
06:29:17.990 --> 06:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
untether um the state from the current
 
06:29:20.548 --> 06:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
definitions of who's eligible and
 
06:29:24.548 --> 06:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
instead kick it over to say kids who um
 
06:29:27.628 --> 06:29:27.638 align:start position:0%
uh are showing signs that in the future
 
06:29:30.230 --> 06:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
they make maybe uh developmentally
 
06:29:32.110 --> 06:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
disabled would now
 
06:29:34.468 --> 06:29:34.478 align:start position:0%
qualify uh in order to make that
 
06:29:36.830 --> 06:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
determination rather than relying on a
 
06:29:40.110 --> 06:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
definition they're relying on a an
 
06:29:42.590 --> 06:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
assessment test that has not been
 
06:29:45.310 --> 06:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
selected there are numerous assessment
 
06:29:47.628 --> 06:29:47.638 align:start position:0%
tests that could be selected but there's
 
06:29:49.510 --> 06:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in the criteria to say which
 
06:29:52.590 --> 06:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
assessment tool would be used there's
 
06:29:56.548 --> 06:29:56.558 align:start position:0%
nothing in the legislation that says who
 
06:30:01.310 --> 06:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
ought to be um qualified to conduct the
 
06:30:03.628 --> 06:30:03.638 align:start position:0%
assessment right now it's left very
 
06:30:06.830 --> 06:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
gener generically to say or any other
 
06:30:09.628 --> 06:30:09.638 align:start position:0%
licensed professional that opens the
 
06:30:13.310 --> 06:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
door to a problem the problem is that um
 
06:30:15.868 --> 06:30:15.878 align:start position:0%
in a in a child care setting you can
 
06:30:19.110 --> 06:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
have licensed individuals who are giving
 
06:30:22.030 --> 06:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
the assessment test with the idea that
 
06:30:24.590 --> 06:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
if the assessment test says one thing
 
06:30:29.628 --> 06:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
they'll get an extra $100 a month um and
 
06:30:31.510 --> 06:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the corporate world we have this
 
06:30:34.590 --> 06:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
thing called segregation of duties where
 
06:30:36.430 --> 06:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
the people who are making the decisions
 
06:30:38.310 --> 06:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
about finances aren't the ones who are
 
06:30:41.388 --> 06:30:41.398 align:start position:0%
going to benefit from it these kind of
 
06:30:44.670 --> 06:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
assessment tools should be independent
 
06:30:47.430 --> 06:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
of the beneficiary or the recipient of
 
06:30:51.670 --> 06:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
the $100 that's just common sense also
 
06:30:54.708 --> 06:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
more common sense an assessment tool
 
06:30:57.388 --> 06:30:57.398 align:start position:0%
like this ought to be conducted by a
 
06:31:00.030 --> 06:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
master's qualified individual I don't
 
06:31:01.708 --> 06:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
know that the education committee
 
06:31:04.388 --> 06:31:04.398 align:start position:0%
considered that point but it is
 
06:31:06.750 --> 06:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
important that an assessment like this
 
06:31:09.670 --> 06:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
be done properly by a professionally
 
06:31:12.708 --> 06:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
trained uh and and qualified person at a
 
06:31:14.310 --> 06:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
at a master's
 
06:31:18.948 --> 06:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
level once the uh assessment is done
 
06:31:21.868 --> 06:31:21.878 align:start position:0%
properly then that $100 will flow to the
 
06:31:25.430 --> 06:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
child care setting for additional uh
 
06:31:28.788 --> 06:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
fees and there's nothing in the bill to
 
06:31:31.350 --> 06:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
say what we'll get for that
 
06:31:34.670 --> 06:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
$100 the proponents of the Bill say oh
 
06:31:36.388 --> 06:31:36.398 align:start position:0%
all this great stuff will happen we're
 
06:31:38.310 --> 06:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
going to hire more people we're going to
 
06:31:40.190 --> 06:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
provide more training but there's
 
06:31:42.868 --> 06:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing in the uh bill that
 
06:31:45.590 --> 06:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
requires that so we would be going on
 
06:31:48.788 --> 06:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
the on trust and um it it's it's
 
06:31:50.310 --> 06:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
probably something that we ought to be
 
06:31:51.990 --> 06:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
more careful about because there's no
 
06:31:54.990 --> 06:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
way to measure the success of this
 
06:31:58.110 --> 06:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
program other than did we spend more
 
06:32:00.670 --> 06:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
money because there are no performance
 
06:32:04.110 --> 06:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
metrics set up in it so so for the these
 
06:32:06.190 --> 06:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
reasons this should go to a study
 
06:32:08.948 --> 06:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
committee so that we can do it right for
 
06:32:10.590 --> 06:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
those of you who are worried about the
 
06:32:12.430 --> 06:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
timing of the money that would flow the
 
06:32:15.510 --> 06:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
extra $100 a month this would basically
 
06:32:18.510 --> 06:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
represent a six-month delay in the the
 
06:32:21.510 --> 06:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
funding starting but if we if we take
 
06:32:25.230 --> 06:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
the time and that we do it right um the
 
06:32:28.030 --> 06:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
the money will go take care of the kids
 
06:32:30.230 --> 06:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
and also do it in a way in which the
 
06:32:32.868 --> 06:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
legislature can be assured that the
 
06:32:35.190 --> 06:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
extra money that's going going in is
 
06:32:37.310 --> 06:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
going to actually come back with some
 
06:32:40.628 --> 06:32:40.638 align:start position:0%
kind of achievable measurable output the
 
06:32:42.548 --> 06:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
achievable measurable output is
 
06:32:44.868 --> 06:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
completely missing from this bill and
 
06:32:48.310 --> 06:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
therefore I recommend uh you press green
 
06:32:50.230 --> 06:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
and um and send this to a study
 
06:32:52.310 --> 06:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
06:32:54.590 --> 06:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
you the questions on the adoption of
 
06:32:57.910 --> 06:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
amendment 1933 H are you ready for the
 
06:33:00.270 --> 06:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
questionis a division's been requested
 
06:33:02.750 --> 06:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
members take your
 
06:33:02.760 --> 06:33:32.708 align:start position:0%
members take your
seats

06:33:32.708 --> 06:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:14.990 --> 06:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:16.270 --> 06:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
the questions on the adoption of
 
06:34:19.230 --> 06:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
amendment 1933
 
06:34:21.948 --> 06:34:21.958 align:start position:0%
H representative Stringham is recognized
 
06:34:26.910 --> 06:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:29.350 --> 06:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
seats thank you Mr
 
06:34:32.350 --> 06:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that children with
 
06:34:35.948 --> 06:34:35.958 align:start position:0%
disabilities face complex care needs for
 
06:34:39.430 --> 06:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
the and the need is growing for the
 
06:34:43.510 --> 06:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
disabled uh to locate child care
 
06:34:45.990 --> 06:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
services and if I know a study committee
 
06:34:49.468 --> 06:34:49.478 align:start position:0%
is not necessary as the program already
 
06:34:52.670 --> 06:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
exists and this change is supported and
 
06:34:55.230 --> 06:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
vetted and a reasonable differential
 
06:34:57.548 --> 06:34:57.558 align:start position:0%
payment for these special needs is
 
06:35:00.190 --> 06:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
specified and items like which
 
06:35:03.990 --> 06:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
assessment int instrument to use is not
 
06:35:07.868 --> 06:35:07.878 align:start position:0%
a critical issue if I know expanding
 
06:35:10.830 --> 06:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
access to child care for those with
 
06:35:13.670 --> 06:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
special needs has a palpable Financial
 
06:35:15.910 --> 06:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
benefit to the
 
06:35:18.548 --> 06:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
state because of our critical need for a
 
06:35:21.270 --> 06:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
broader Workforce and those that canine
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
Child Care are more likely to work if I
 
06:35:26.670 --> 06:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
know without this
 
06:35:29.910 --> 06:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill workers who happen to be a parent
 
06:35:33.230 --> 06:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
to a disabled child will be much more
 
06:35:34.910 --> 06:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
likely to stay
 
06:35:38.150 --> 06:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
home so would I vote no on the committee
 
06:35:40.830 --> 06:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to form a study committee
 
06:35:42.750 --> 06:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
which would delay arrival of federal
 
06:35:46.430 --> 06:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
money and delay delay access for this
 
06:35:48.708 --> 06:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
group of needy individuals so that
 
06:35:52.110 --> 06:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
another OTP motion can be made thank you
 
06:35:54.510 --> 06:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
for considering it representative
 
06:35:55.788 --> 06:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
Edwards is recognized for a
 
06:35:55.798 --> 06:35:58.270 align:start position:0%
Edwards is recognized for a
parliamentary

06:35:58.270 --> 06:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
06:36:01.628 --> 06:36:01.638 align:start position:0%
inquiry uh thank you Mr Speaker if if I
 
06:36:04.590 --> 06:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
know that segregation of d duties is the
 
06:36:07.548 --> 06:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
standard normal way in which uh wise
 
06:36:10.788 --> 06:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
businesses avoid fraud waste and abuse
 
06:36:13.070 --> 06:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
potential and that the way this bill is
 
06:36:17.190 --> 06:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
set up that uh possibility exists
 
06:36:18.830 --> 06:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
because the people that could do the
 
06:36:20.270 --> 06:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
assessment or the people that would
 
06:36:22.670 --> 06:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
receive money from the assessment and
 
06:36:24.628 --> 06:36:24.638 align:start position:0%
that if I knew that there were no
 
06:36:27.750 --> 06:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
performance metrics to say what is going
 
06:36:30.670 --> 06:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
to be happening for the kid in exchange
 
06:36:32.590 --> 06:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
for the additional money all we know
 
06:36:34.430 --> 06:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
that additional money will go into the
 
06:36:37.590 --> 06:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
child care system we if we know that
 
06:36:39.510 --> 06:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there to assure
 
06:36:42.510 --> 06:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
performance or measurables then would I
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
go ahead and send this to a subcommittee
 
06:36:47.110 --> 06:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
or a study committee so that we can
 
06:36:49.430 --> 06:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
resolve these things and that we can
 
06:36:53.070 --> 06:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
confidently spend money in a wise way in
 
06:36:55.310 --> 06:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
a way that's most likely to actually
 
06:37:01.270 --> 06:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:11.190 --> 06:37:11.200 align:start position:0%

you will all support with
 
06:52:02.548 --> 06:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
me again we've passed this bill that
 
06:52:04.430 --> 06:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
that the amendment covers two times
 
06:52:06.788 --> 06:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
through this body and put to the other
 
06:52:08.548 --> 06:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
side of the
 
06:52:10.868 --> 06:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
body the last time it went to the other
 
06:52:13.868 --> 06:52:13.878 align:start position:0%
side of the body we made changes here
 
06:52:15.510 --> 06:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
that they said were critical to them to
 
06:52:17.628 --> 06:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
pass it over there we made sure that
 
06:52:19.750 --> 06:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
this would not apply to anyone under
 
06:52:22.190 --> 06:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
18 and we passed it with more support
 
06:52:22.200 --> 06:52:23.868 align:start position:0%
18 and we passed it with more support
than

06:52:23.868 --> 06:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
than
 
06:52:27.190 --> 06:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
previously we removed brass knuckles
 
06:52:28.990 --> 06:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
blackjacks and slungshot from
 
06:52:31.590 --> 06:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
criminalized weapons for a small portion
 
06:52:33.910 --> 06:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the state when we we know that
 
06:52:35.430 --> 06:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
they're legal for anybody with a hunting
 
06:52:37.310 --> 06:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
and fishing license or who works in law
 
06:52:39.430 --> 06:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement or is an emergency EMS
 
06:52:41.708 --> 06:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
driver and several other classifications
 
06:52:43.868 --> 06:52:43.878 align:start position:0%
where it's okay for you to carry them
 
06:52:46.510 --> 06:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
but it's not okay for everyone else we
 
06:52:48.150 --> 06:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
leveled the playing field for anyone
 
06:52:49.830 --> 06:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
that was over
 
06:52:52.590 --> 06:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
18 but even though we made the changes
 
06:52:53.948 --> 06:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
that they
 
06:52:55.948 --> 06:52:55.958 align:start position:0%
requested they still said they were
 
06:52:58.948 --> 06:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
going to ENT and study it and they said
 
06:53:01.628 --> 06:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
no so again I'm telling you that this
 
06:53:03.150 --> 06:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is more than a single bill
 
06:53:08.070 --> 06:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:11.468 --> 06:53:11.478 align:start position:0%
body again I'm going to
 
06:53:14.948 --> 06:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
request that we do what we've done two
 
06:53:17.230 --> 06:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
times before and send this amendment
 
06:53:19.548 --> 06:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
back over for reconsideration on the
 
06:53:22.628 --> 06:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
other side because it makes sense it
 
06:53:24.708 --> 06:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
follows our Second
 
06:53:30.270 --> 06:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment it allows for people to carry
 
06:53:34.070 --> 06:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
self-defense objects that I mean are are
 
06:53:35.430 --> 06:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
no different than what we've already
 
06:53:39.150 --> 06:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
Declassified in fact less harmful than
 
06:53:43.190 --> 06:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh Firearms knives of any length
 
06:53:46.350 --> 06:53:46.360 align:start position:0%
swords tasers pepper spray all that's
 
06:53:48.110 --> 06:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
legal for anyone over 18 but we're going
 
06:53:49.388 --> 06:53:49.398 align:start position:0%
to sell them that they can't carry
 
06:53:51.948 --> 06:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
something like this so we've made the
 
06:53:53.750 --> 06:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
changes they requested we're limiting it
 
06:53:56.990 --> 06:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
to only those that are over 18 and I'm
 
06:53:58.750 --> 06:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to please help me
 
06:54:00.910 --> 06:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
support this amendment and send it back
 
06:54:03.468 --> 06:54:03.478 align:start position:0%

Muse thank you Mr
 
06:54:18.830 --> 06:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker currently carrying or possessing
 
06:54:20.350 --> 06:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
these weapons with the intent to sell
 
06:54:22.430 --> 06:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
them is a misdemeanor in New Hampshire
 
06:54:25.030 --> 06:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
and with very good reason these are
 
06:54:28.030 --> 06:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
weapons used by aggressors to intimidate
 
06:54:30.910 --> 06:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
terrorize and to brutally attack their
 
06:54:33.468 --> 06:54:33.478 align:start position:0%
victims the injur Ines caused by these
 
06:54:36.110 --> 06:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
weapons can be devastating in addition
 
06:54:38.030 --> 06:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
to inflicting concussions and potential
 
06:54:40.468 --> 06:54:40.478 align:start position:0%
brain damage these weapons can fracture
 
06:54:43.910 --> 06:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
skulls break bones destroy teeth and
 
06:54:46.110 --> 06:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
cause wounds that require dozens of
 
06:54:49.548 --> 06:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
stitches and plastic surgery to fix if a
 
06:54:52.590 --> 06:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
doctor in fact can fix them at all the
 
06:54:54.190 --> 06:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
bottom line is that if we remove the
 
06:54:56.868 --> 06:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
current prohibition we might be making a
 
06:54:58.868 --> 06:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
few more of these weapons available to
 
06:55:01.708 --> 06:55:01.718 align:start position:0%
so-called average citizens but we'd also
 
06:55:03.150 --> 06:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
be making the these weapons more
 
06:55:05.830 --> 06:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
attractive and more available to Street
 
06:55:08.990 --> 06:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
criminals and Thugs who can and will use
 
06:55:12.230 --> 06:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
them to intimidate coerce and to assault
 
06:55:14.548 --> 06:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
their victims as well as to injure
 
06:55:16.548 --> 06:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
police officers in the performance of
 
06:55:16.558 --> 06:55:17.548 align:start position:0%
police officers in the performance of
their

06:55:17.548 --> 06:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:55:19.910 --> 06:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
duties at a time when many of us claim
 
06:55:21.868 --> 06:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
to be working hard to come up with ways
 
06:55:24.788 --> 06:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
to enhance the safety of our communities
 
06:55:27.788 --> 06:55:27.798 align:start position:0%
the one thing we should not do is pass a
 
06:55:30.070 --> 06:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
needless Amendment opposed by the New
 
06:55:32.590 --> 06:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs of Police Association
 
06:55:34.350 --> 06:55:34.360 align:start position:0%
that would instantly make our

communities our schools our bars and our
 
06:55:40.430 --> 06:55:40.440 align:start position:0%

06:55:43.510 --> 06:55:43.520 align:start position:0%

07:06:45.708 --> 07:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:51.628 --> 07:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:55.190 --> 07:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr Speaker there were
 
07:06:57.030 --> 07:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
several very important bills that this
 
07:06:59.070 --> 07:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
body passed um they were around
 
07:07:01.990 --> 07:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping in child care centers and
 
07:07:04.030 --> 07:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations um when we considered this
 
07:07:06.150 --> 07:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
in our body we looked at all the data
 
07:07:08.388 --> 07:07:08.398 align:start position:0%
all the information and we looked into
 
07:07:10.430 --> 07:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
the validity of the statements made in
 
07:07:12.868 --> 07:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
committee unfortunately the other body
 
07:07:14.670 --> 07:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
heard from some people who had a
 
07:07:16.948 --> 07:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
particular interest and decided that the
 
07:07:19.190 --> 07:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
bill should not move forward therefore
 
07:07:22.070 --> 07:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
we have added House Bill 1231 in this
 
07:07:23.948 --> 07:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
amendment in order to send it back so
 
07:07:25.230 --> 07:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
that we can reduce the burden on our
 
07:07:28.468 --> 07:07:28.478 align:start position:0%
child care centers this amendment also
 
07:07:31.628 --> 07:07:31.638 align:start position:0%
takes um House Bill 1194 which is
 
07:07:33.190 --> 07:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of Comm
 
07:07:35.590 --> 07:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
non-communicable disease as we are
 
07:07:37.190 --> 07:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
looking at these vaccinations and
 
07:07:39.868 --> 07:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
looking at more of this process we need
 
07:07:42.030 --> 07:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
to talk about whether or not vaccines
 
07:07:44.510 --> 07:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
for for anything that is not actually
 
07:07:47.030 --> 07:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
communicable person to person should be
 
07:07:48.708 --> 07:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
within the definition when you're
 
07:07:49.948 --> 07:07:49.958 align:start position:0%
talking about something that doesn't
 
07:07:51.670 --> 07:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
spread person to person there is no
 
07:07:53.910 --> 07:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
public health benefit this body already
 
07:07:56.868 --> 07:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
stated it that way however when there
 
07:07:58.868 --> 07:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
was a discussion in the other body there
 
07:08:01.990 --> 07:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
was conflicting information presented um
 
07:08:04.468 --> 07:08:04.478 align:start position:0%
there had been some testimony um on one
 
07:08:07.548 --> 07:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
of these bills where a a where somebody
 
07:08:09.110 --> 07:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
from the government made one statement
 
07:08:10.868 --> 07:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
and then they provided data that was
 
07:08:12.830 --> 07:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
different in committee um this needs
 
07:08:14.830 --> 07:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
further attention so it's very important
 
07:08:17.468 --> 07:08:17.478 align:start position:0%
that we attach this and F and I ask for
 
07:08:18.910 --> 07:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
your support there are three important
 
07:08:20.868 --> 07:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
bills I think it's worthwhile and it
 
07:08:22.388 --> 07:08:22.398 align:start position:0%
should resolve any objections to the
 
07:08:24.230 --> 07:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
underlying bill should we pass this
 
07:08:26.190 --> 07:08:26.200 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment so I ask that you vote
 
07:08:28.788 --> 07:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
in favor of this amendment thank you
 
07:08:34.990 --> 07:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:39.548 --> 07:08:39.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker up until
 
07:08:41.670 --> 07:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
the last few bills we were doing a
 
07:08:46.150 --> 07:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:49.750 --> 07:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
attaching different bills to the
 
07:08:52.430 --> 07:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
important policies that are under
 
07:08:56.230 --> 07:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
discussion and if you believe as I
 
07:09:00.230 --> 07:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
do that having a clean vote on a clean
 
07:09:03.830 --> 07:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill is is a much better way to pass
 
07:09:05.750 --> 07:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
laws than
 
07:09:10.070 --> 07:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
playing the same games that the other
 
07:09:12.750 --> 07:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
place is likely to
 
07:09:19.468 --> 07:09:19.478 align:start position:0%
play um I hope you will reconsider these
 
07:09:22.510 --> 07:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
bills in addition these are not like
 
07:09:24.150 --> 07:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
some of the bills that we've adopted
 
07:09:27.270 --> 07:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
where everybody was in agreement uh
 
07:09:31.788 --> 07:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
there's considerable reason not to adopt
 
07:09:34.350 --> 07:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
first the change in definition of a
 
07:09:37.310 --> 07:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
non-communicable disease because it
 
07:09:40.590 --> 07:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
removes infectious diseases other than
 
07:09:42.830 --> 07:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
tetanus if they're not transmitted
 
07:09:46.388 --> 07:09:46.398 align:start position:0%
personto person and we all know that
 
07:09:48.590 --> 07:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
there are infectious diseases in
 
07:09:51.030 --> 07:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
addition to tetanus which can be
 
07:09:53.548 --> 07:09:53.558 align:start position:0%
transmitted person to not personto
 
07:09:57.670 --> 07:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
person but through a vector like a tick
 
07:10:00.830 --> 07:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
or a vector like a mosquito and that
 
07:10:04.070 --> 07:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
those diseases are moving closer to us
 
07:10:08.150 --> 07:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
all the time so this is not an advisable
 
07:10:12.468 --> 07:10:12.478 align:start position:0%
step to take the second one removes the
 
07:10:14.628 --> 07:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
requirement of immunization records at
 
07:10:17.708 --> 07:10:17.718 align:start position:0%
child care agencies which means that
 
07:10:20.708 --> 07:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
parents will be unable to get the
 
07:10:20.718 --> 07:10:22.190 align:start position:0%
parents will be unable to get the
aggregated

07:10:22.190 --> 07:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
aggregated
 
07:10:27.310 --> 07:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
data that enable each parent to choose
 
07:10:30.590 --> 07:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
What Child Care Agency they want their
 
07:10:34.310 --> 07:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
kid to be that in accordance with their
 
07:10:38.230 --> 07:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
preferences for their family so it
 
07:10:40.510 --> 07:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
removes parental
 
07:10:45.830 --> 07:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
choice and the final issue is the data
 
07:10:48.510 --> 07:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
sharing provision which
 
07:10:48.520 --> 07:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
sharing provision which
again

07:10:51.590 --> 07:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:54.468 --> 07:10:54.478 align:start position:0%
uh is another bill that
 
07:10:57.350 --> 07:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
expands expends
 
07:11:01.670 --> 07:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
$107,000 for personnel and $80,000
 
07:11:04.388 --> 07:11:04.398 align:start position:0%
for system upgrades that we could be
 
07:11:08.070 --> 07:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
using for other things so with all of
 
07:11:13.548 --> 07:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
that I hope you will let us pass a clean
 
07:11:17.270 --> 07:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill with the amendment that we adopted
 
07:11:20.270 --> 07:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
that makes the bill much better and go
 
07:11:24.110 --> 07:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
on to hear about that Amendment because
 
07:11:27.350 --> 07:11:27.360 align:start position:0%

07:11:27.360 --> 07:11:28.430 align:start position:0%

small
 
07:11:31.788 --> 07:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
children is really important and the
 
07:11:33.750 --> 07:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just passed narrowed
 
07:11:36.910 --> 07:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
the bill down to just that so kindly
 
07:11:39.468 --> 07:11:39.478 align:start position:0%
vote against the amendment by pressing
 
07:11:42.150 --> 07:11:42.160 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
07:13:17.590 --> 07:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
that this floor Amendment would add
 
07:13:19.590 --> 07:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1213 relative to the

redistricting data sharing through the

state immunization registry to a bill
 
07:13:36.230 --> 07:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
that simply allows a little bit more
 
07:13:38.510 --> 07:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility in which vaccines
 
07:13:40.990 --> 07:13:41.000 align:start position:0%

believe if you believe as I do that we
 
07:14:10.350 --> 07:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
should be letting the policy in this
 
07:14:13.990 --> 07:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill stand by itself because we know
 
07:14:16.788 --> 07:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
that the other considerations have all
 
07:14:20.788 --> 07:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
been rejected by the other body would I
 
07:14:24.788 --> 07:14:24.798 align:start position:0%

07:16:46.990 --> 07:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
treatment the disease was studied by
 
07:16:50.150 --> 07:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
many doctors but the report was written
 
07:16:53.468 --> 07:16:53.478 align:start position:0%
by only two these two stated that two
 
07:16:55.548 --> 07:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
weeks of antibiotics was all that was
 
07:16:59.350 --> 07:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
needed and lime was cured in spite of
 
07:17:01.310 --> 07:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
the objections of the other doct s on
 
07:17:04.030 --> 07:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
the committee who said this didn't take
 
07:17:06.510 --> 07:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
into consideration the people with
 
07:17:06.520 --> 07:17:08.190 align:start position:0%
into consideration the people with
chronic

07:17:08.190 --> 07:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
chronic
 
07:17:11.030 --> 07:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
lime the report was released the
 
07:17:14.150 --> 07:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation was made and doctors who
 
07:17:16.310 --> 07:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
treated lime patients for more than two
 
07:17:19.430 --> 07:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
weeks with antibiotics lost their
 
07:17:23.590 --> 07:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
licenses for not following CDC
 
07:17:26.388 --> 07:17:26.398 align:start position:0%
recommendations doctors were afraid many
 
07:17:28.788 --> 07:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
stopped treating lime patients others
 
07:17:32.190 --> 07:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:34.670 --> 07:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
I had been treated with antibiotics for
 
07:17:38.468 --> 07:17:38.478 align:start position:0%
two weeks many times didn't cure my
 
07:17:41.030 --> 07:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
lime it made me feel a little better for
 
07:17:42.750 --> 07:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
a little while but I slowly got worse
 
07:17:45.510 --> 07:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
and worse and I finally found a natural
 
07:17:47.468 --> 07:17:47.478 align:start position:0%
path who wasn't under the thumb of the
 
07:17:50.468 --> 07:17:50.478 align:start position:0%
CDC and wasn't worried about losing her
 
07:17:53.750 --> 07:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
license it took three years of
 
07:17:56.430 --> 07:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
antibiotic and herbal cocktails but I
 
07:17:59.910 --> 07:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
was finally cured of lime 3 years is
 
07:18:02.310 --> 07:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
considerably long longer than the CDC
 
07:18:06.070 --> 07:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation of two
 
07:18:09.990 --> 07:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
weeks the CDC has shown that they are
 
07:18:10.000 --> 07:18:11.788 align:start position:0%
weeks the CDC has shown that they are
not

07:18:11.788 --> 07:18:11.798 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:18:14.670 --> 07:18:14.680 align:start position:0%

07:18:24.310 --> 07:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
treatment why would you pass this bill
 
07:18:27.910 --> 07:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
to further trust the
 
07:18:30.868 --> 07:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
CDC we shouldn't be trusting them to do
 
07:18:35.270 --> 07:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
our job there are 424 of us between us
 
07:18:37.788 --> 07:18:37.798 align:start position:0%

whom we can call upon for advice do not

discount our ability to make the proper
 
07:18:54.948 --> 07:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
decision when it comes to vaccines
 
07:18:57.788 --> 07:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
please vote itl on this dangerous
 
07:19:00.910 --> 07:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you chair recognize

07:19:10.468 --> 07:19:10.478 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you Mr speaker thank you I
 
07:19:14.910 --> 07:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
was a nurse for 42 years I gave lots of
 
07:19:18.030 --> 07:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
injections hundreds of injections I
 
07:19:21.468 --> 07:19:21.478 align:start position:0%
worked intensive care but I learned from
 
07:19:24.868 --> 07:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
day one if you gave an intramuscular
 
07:19:28.310 --> 07:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
injection you gave it a certain way for
 
07:19:32.830 --> 07:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
a very specific reason reason I rise in
 
07:19:36.628 --> 07:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
opposition to 402 there is a battle for
 
07:19:41.310 --> 07:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
our hearts and the CDC is winning it but
 
07:19:45.150 --> 07:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't search the internet for the
 
07:19:51.310 --> 07:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
CDC pink book it is on the CDC website
 
07:19:54.150 --> 07:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
it is their official recommendations
 
07:19:56.190 --> 07:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
regarding all
 
07:19:58.190 --> 07:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for
 
07:20:01.350 --> 07:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
decades intramuscular injection were
 
07:20:04.590 --> 07:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
done with an aspiration and slowly to
 
07:20:07.708 --> 07:20:07.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that inflammation is contained
 
07:20:10.350 --> 07:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
in the tissue and does not go into the
 
07:20:13.230 --> 07:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
bloodstream and Into the Heart in other
 
07:20:15.708 --> 07:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
words you put the needle back you pulled
 
07:20:17.230 --> 07:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
back a little to make sure that you
 
07:20:20.750 --> 07:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
weren't in a blood vessel and if you
 
07:20:23.830 --> 07:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
were not then you injected it so that
 
07:20:27.750 --> 07:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
that Med or That vaccine did not go
 
07:20:27.760 --> 07:20:29.628 align:start position:0%
that Med or That vaccine did not go
directly

07:20:29.628 --> 07:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
directly
 
07:20:34.628 --> 07:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
into into your blood and to your
 
07:20:41.070 --> 07:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
heart in or around 2021 the CDC reversed
 
07:20:46.750 --> 07:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
180° chapter 6 now says inject vaccines
 
07:20:49.230 --> 07:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
rapidly without
 
07:20:52.670 --> 07:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
aspiration CDC openly states that they
 
07:20:56.190 --> 07:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
base that on a single study and only
 
07:20:59.190 --> 07:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
checked for immediate events so
 
07:21:02.510 --> 07:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
therefore we can put this needle in and
 
07:21:04.830 --> 07:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
it can go right into your
 
07:21:08.910 --> 07:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
bloodstream no long-term control no
 
07:21:11.270 --> 07:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
07:21:14.350 --> 07:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
myocarditis no concerns about all kids
 
07:21:17.030 --> 07:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
and young P kids that are suddenly
 
07:21:17.040 --> 07:21:19.430 align:start position:0%
and young P kids that are suddenly
getting

07:21:19.430 --> 07:21:19.440 align:start position:0%

myocarditis and blood related
 
07:21:26.548 --> 07:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
diseases zero concerns for died
 
07:21:29.270 --> 07:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
suddenly we should not release the
 
07:21:31.190 --> 07:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
general Court's Authority
 
07:21:35.350 --> 07:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
to irresponsible agencies like the CDC
 
07:21:39.708 --> 07:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
and the FDA if anything we should double
 
07:21:42.548 --> 07:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
check everything they recommend please
 
07:21:45.030 --> 07:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
vote against this
 
07:21:54.468 --> 07:21:54.478 align:start position:0%

amended that removes the barriers to
 
07:22:09.388 --> 07:22:09.398 align:start position:0%
Patient Choice reduces healthc care cost
 
07:22:11.190 --> 07:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
while increasing increasing patient
 
07:22:12.388 --> 07:22:12.398 align:start position:0%
access to
 
07:22:14.670 --> 07:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines pharmacists have extensive
 
07:22:16.468 --> 07:22:16.478 align:start position:0%
training experience making them well
 
07:22:18.750 --> 07:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
qualified and equipped to handle
 
07:22:21.388 --> 07:22:21.398 align:start position:0%
vaccinations provide patient education

misinformation pharmacists have safely
 
07:22:29.868 --> 07:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
repeat safely provided thousands of
 
07:22:31.990 --> 07:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines patients over many
 
07:22:34.030 --> 07:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
years pharmacist are available in

community settings as Community
 
07:22:37.948 --> 07:22:37.958 align:start position:0%
pharmacies which have longer hours and
 
07:22:39.628 --> 07:22:39.638 align:start position:0%
are more accessible than traditional

underserved areas where Access to Health
 
07:22:50.868 --> 07:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
Care Providers may be limited offering
 
07:22:53.070 --> 07:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines and pharmacies reduces
 
07:22:56.150 --> 07:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
logistical and financial barriers for
 
07:22:58.190 --> 07:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
patients such as the need to make an
 
07:23:00.948 --> 07:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
employment or take time off from work
 
07:23:02.708 --> 07:23:02.718 align:start position:0%
pharmacists can quickly integrate
 
07:23:05.430 --> 07:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination Services into routine care
 
07:23:07.468 --> 07:23:07.478 align:start position:0%
during a medication
 
07:23:09.628 --> 07:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
pickup by allowing pharmacists to have
 
07:23:13.030 --> 07:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
greater access providing vaccines that
 
07:23:14.750 --> 07:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
other Healthcare Providers other
 
07:23:16.270 --> 07:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers can
 
07:23:18.708 --> 07:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
do it allows them to focus their
 
07:23:22.150 --> 07:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
attention on more complex medical care
 
07:23:25.150 --> 07:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I ask that you support
 
07:23:27.830 --> 07:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
the committee Amendment 1810 along with
 
07:23:30.150 --> 07:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
the recommendation by the committee a
 
07:23:33.788 --> 07:23:33.798 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan vote 14-6 of ought to
 
07:23:36.110 --> 07:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
pass as amended thank
 
07:23:38.708 --> 07:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
you and division has been requested
 
07:23:59.350 --> 07:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:41.350 --> 07:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:43.190 --> 07:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass as
 
07:24:46.868 --> 07:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill on Senate Bill 402
 
07:24:49.830 --> 07:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
this a division vote chair recognized

07:24:56.190 --> 07:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:58.708 --> 07:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
07:25:01.430 --> 07:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know pharmacists
 
07:25:03.670 --> 07:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
graduate today with a doctorates and if
 
07:25:04.830 --> 07:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
I know pharmacists have safely
 
07:25:06.430 --> 07:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
administered thousands of vaccines over
 
07:25:10.030 --> 07:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
many years and if I know SB 402 allows
 
07:25:12.110 --> 07:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
patients greater access in choice of
 
07:25:14.468 --> 07:25:14.478 align:start position:0%
providers who may provide a vaccine
 
07:25:16.350 --> 07:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
licensed by the FDA and recommended by
 
07:25:20.708 --> 07:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
the CDC and if I know that SB 402 saves
 
07:25:23.670 --> 07:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
patients time and money since pharmacist
 
07:25:25.590 --> 07:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
administrative vaccines are typically
 
07:25:27.788 --> 07:25:27.798 align:start position:0%
less expensive and often more convenient
 
07:25:30.670 --> 07:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
than a trip to a doctor and if I know s
 
07:25:33.830 --> 07:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
SP 402 removes barriers for pharmacists
 
07:25:35.430 --> 07:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
to provide vaccines allowed to be
 
07:25:37.110 --> 07:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
administered by other healthc care
 
07:25:39.868 --> 07:25:39.878 align:start position:0%
providers creating more competition and
 
07:25:42.230 --> 07:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
patient choice in the market but I now
 
07:25:44.430 --> 07:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
push the green button to pass the
 
07:25:47.030 --> 07:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment as recommendation to ought to
 
07:25:48.990 --> 07:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
pass as amended and I ask for division

to the Department of Health and Human
 
07:33:55.110 --> 07:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
Services for statistical purposes I'm
 
07:33:56.788 --> 07:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
here to oppose the committee
 
07:33:58.788 --> 07:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation of itl and speak on
 
07:34:00.990 --> 07:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
behalf of the minority
 
07:34:05.030 --> 07:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment while the issue of abortion is
 
07:34:07.670 --> 07:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly a divisive one one thing
 
07:34:09.350 --> 07:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
that all sides on the issue agree on is
 
07:34:11.750 --> 07:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a great benefit in
 
07:34:13.030 --> 07:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
understanding the drivers towards
 
07:34:15.388 --> 07:34:15.398 align:start position:0%
unwanted pregnancy and assessing Trends
 
07:34:19.070 --> 07:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
in clinical practice and that's why 47
 
07:34:22.150 --> 07:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
of 50 States including pro-choice States
 
07:34:24.510 --> 07:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
like New York and California provide
 
07:34:27.948 --> 07:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
data to the CDC data which is
 
07:34:30.350 --> 07:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
aggressively analyzed by an entities
 
07:34:32.910 --> 07:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
such as the Pew Research Center and the
 
07:34:35.230 --> 07:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
pro-choice good marcker Institute to
 
07:34:38.788 --> 07:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
better understand the abortion framework
 
07:34:41.230 --> 07:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of only three
 
07:34:43.388 --> 07:34:43.398 align:start position:0%
states that does not provide information
 
07:34:46.030 --> 07:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
and as a result we know very little
 
07:34:48.190 --> 07:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
about abortion practice here in this
 
07:34:51.628 --> 07:34:51.638 align:start position:0%
state and the concern why that is is
 
07:34:53.510 --> 07:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has always been uh
 
07:34:55.628 --> 07:34:55.638 align:start position:0%
there's always been a concern that
 
07:34:58.190 --> 07:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
abortion data might be traced back to a
 
07:35:00.230 --> 07:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
patient or provider and used as a weapon
 
07:35:02.350 --> 07:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
against them and nobody in this chamber
 
07:35:05.510 --> 07:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
wants that and it's for that reason that
 
07:35:09.030 --> 07:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
when SB 461 first came over from the
 
07:35:11.110 --> 07:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
body across the wall it was basically
 
07:35:13.868 --> 07:35:13.878 align:start position:0%
Dead on Arrival both the clinics and
 
07:35:15.510 --> 07:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
privacy Advocates alikes were all
 
07:35:17.750 --> 07:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about the consequences of the
 
07:35:20.468 --> 07:35:20.478 align:start position:0%
data potentially being deaggregated to
 
07:35:22.388 --> 07:35:22.398 align:start position:0%
address those concerns though the
 
07:35:25.708 --> 07:35:25.718 align:start position:0%
minority Amendment explicitly prohibits
 
07:35:27.868 --> 07:35:27.878 align:start position:0%
the facility performing the abortion
 
07:35:29.948 --> 07:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
representative the minority Amendment
 
07:35:33.150 --> 07:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
isn't before us so okay contain yourself
 
07:35:35.190 --> 07:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
07:35:35.200 --> 07:35:37.830 align:start position:0%
to the bill
itself

07:35:37.830 --> 07:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
itself
 
07:35:41.510 --> 07:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the the bill itself um there were
 
07:35:45.270 --> 07:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns with the bill but uh if
 
07:35:48.350 --> 07:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
we um were
 
07:35:51.030 --> 07:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
to how can I say this
 
07:35:55.270 --> 07:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
um if we pass on the ought to pass there
 
07:35:57.670 --> 07:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
is a minority amendment that would
 
07:36:00.948 --> 07:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
address the um
 
07:36:05.990 --> 07:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
the privacy concerns and um give some
 
07:36:08.670 --> 07:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
explicit rights to basically op out and
 
07:36:10.030 --> 07:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
I do think that we should have an
 
07:36:12.948 --> 07:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear what is being
 
07:36:15.670 --> 07:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
expressed in that Minority position and
 
07:36:20.388 --> 07:36:20.398 align:start position:0%
so um I hope that you will uh push the
 
07:36:23.788 --> 07:36:23.798 align:start position:0%
uh red button and uh oppose the itl
 
07:36:25.708 --> 07:36:25.718 align:start position:0%
motion to give me an opportunity to
 
07:36:27.270 --> 07:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
speak to that Minority Amendment thank
 
07:36:32.948 --> 07:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:36.350 --> 07:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I
 
07:36:41.030 --> 07:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
Rise to defend the 13-7 vote in
 
07:36:43.430 --> 07:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee for inexpedient to legislate
 
07:36:47.468 --> 07:36:47.478 align:start position:0%
for this bill so why am I standing here
 
07:36:51.990 --> 07:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
opposing a bill of which I was a
 
07:36:55.510 --> 07:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor well strange things happen in
 
07:36:58.628 --> 07:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
the place that we may not mention and
 
07:37:00.750 --> 07:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
this bill which was a very different
 
07:37:04.150 --> 07:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
bill at Birth is now
 
07:37:08.190 --> 07:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
completely opposite to its original
 
07:37:10.788 --> 07:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
intention the bills that came to us from
 
07:37:13.670 --> 07:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate has significant issues with
 
07:37:16.830 --> 07:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
privacy in contravention of our
 
07:37:19.150 --> 07:37:19.160 align:start position:0%

07:37:27.548 --> 07:37:27.558 align:start position:0%
it our committee was visited by The
 
07:37:30.430 --> 07:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
Honorable former member from way
 
07:37:34.190 --> 07:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
who expressed his deepest
 
07:37:38.670 --> 07:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
concerns as came to us it says
 
07:37:40.910 --> 07:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
specifically that there is no
 
07:37:44.468 --> 07:37:44.478 align:start position:0%
requirement of disclosing personal
 
07:37:46.468 --> 07:37:46.478 align:start position:0%
identification to the Department of
 
07:37:48.190 --> 07:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
Health and Human
 
07:37:51.350 --> 07:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
Services but there was no prohibition at
 
07:37:53.230 --> 07:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
all about
 
07:37:55.708 --> 07:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
disclosing personally identifiable
 
07:37:59.150 --> 07:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
information so it could happen and as we
 
07:38:02.388 --> 07:38:02.398 align:start position:0%
all know even in the aggregate data can
 
07:38:05.510 --> 07:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
be deidentified especially when we're
 
07:38:07.830 --> 07:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
looking at a state that has very small
 
07:38:10.750 --> 07:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:13.750 --> 07:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
Centers disclosing a state of residence
 
07:38:17.230 --> 07:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
which is required in the Bill of a
 
07:38:19.628 --> 07:38:19.638 align:start position:0%
pregnant person puts that patient of
 
07:38:22.468 --> 07:38:22.478 align:start position:0%
risk if it's an outof State patient of
 
07:38:25.030 --> 07:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
prosecution under other states laws in
 
07:38:26.430 --> 07:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
their home
 
07:38:29.868 --> 07:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
States requiring as the bill does an
 
07:38:32.510 --> 07:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
exact gestational age is
 
07:38:34.468 --> 07:38:34.478 align:start position:0%
problematical as that's usually
 
07:38:36.110 --> 07:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
determined by an
 
07:38:39.590 --> 07:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
ultrasound which is not a necessary
 
07:38:41.670 --> 07:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
procedure and which is an invasive
 
07:38:44.670 --> 07:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
procedure and yet another impingement on
 
07:38:47.150 --> 07:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the
 
07:38:51.030 --> 07:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
individual broad discretion is given to
 
07:38:51.040 --> 07:38:51.868 align:start position:0%
individual broad discretion is given to
the

07:38:51.868 --> 07:38:51.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:38:54.990 --> 07:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner as to what data is
 
07:38:57.070 --> 07:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
aggregated and released and how it's
 
07:38:59.788 --> 07:38:59.798 align:start position:0%
aggregated and released
 
07:39:03.110 --> 07:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that the bill has
 
07:39:05.430 --> 07:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
great risks to
 
07:39:12.350 --> 07:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
privacy and as we fix the privacy
 
07:39:15.910 --> 07:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
concerns increasingly the data that is
 
07:39:20.350 --> 07:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
collected is of no use whatsoever for
 
07:39:20.360 --> 07:39:21.510 align:start position:0%

Public

07:39:21.510 --> 07:39:21.520 align:start position:0%

Policy
 
07:39:28.308 --> 07:39:28.318 align:start position:0%
creation because it's simply too
 
07:39:31.468 --> 07:39:31.478 align:start position:0%
randomized bhhs estimated that it would
 
07:39:34.388 --> 07:39:34.398 align:start position:0%
cost about a million dollar to enact and
 
07:39:34.398 --> 07:39:35.350 align:start position:0%
cost about a million dollar to enact and
and

07:39:35.350 --> 07:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:39:38.990 --> 07:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
effect um uh an effective data
 
07:39:41.150 --> 07:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
collection system which is supposed to
 
07:39:42.750 --> 07:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
be done
 
07:39:42.760 --> 07:39:45.230 align:start position:0%
be done
immediately

07:39:45.230 --> 07:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
07:39:48.468 --> 07:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
finally I note that in our
 
07:39:51.910 --> 07:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee only one person testified in
 
07:39:53.548 --> 07:39:53.558 align:start position:0%
favor of this
 
07:39:57.990 --> 07:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill and to bring us full circle none of
 
07:40:00.190 --> 07:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
the persons on the the other side of the
 
07:40:04.030 --> 07:40:04.040 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know that if we defeat
 
07:42:52.350 --> 07:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
this motion I worked with that former
 
07:42:56.230 --> 07:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative from we on a uh Amendment
 
07:42:58.388 --> 07:42:58.398 align:start position:0%
which addresses all of these privacy
 
07:42:59.708 --> 07:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
concerns including cluding having a

adopt out of having the statistics
 
07:43:06.270 --> 07:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
gathered would I then press the red
 
07:43:09.548 --> 07:43:09.558 align:start position:0%
button to defeat the itl motion so that
 
07:43:10.830 --> 07:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
um the amendment might be brought
 
07:43:12.308 --> 07:43:12.318 align:start position:0%

for a par inquiry thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:43:21.270 --> 07:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
07:43:25.708 --> 07:43:25.718 align:start position:0%
contains many privacy concerns if I know
 
07:43:29.110 --> 07:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
that as you fix privacy concerns the
 
07:43:31.590 --> 07:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
value of the data that you collect
 
07:43:34.308 --> 07:43:34.318 align:start position:0%
becomes less and less useful for public
 
07:43:35.788 --> 07:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
health policy
 
07:43:39.510 --> 07:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
purposes and finally if I want to
 
07:43:41.910 --> 07:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
discourage the practice which this house
 
07:43:45.070 --> 07:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
has thankfully departed from in recent
 
07:43:49.590 --> 07:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
years but that another place may have
 
07:43:53.590 --> 07:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
used which takes a bill turns it 18 180
 
07:43:55.990 --> 07:43:56.000 align:start position:0%

leaving the names of all the sponsors on
 
07:44:01.948 --> 07:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
it and encourage them to Simply file the
 
07:44:04.070 --> 07:44:04.080 align:start position:0%

07:46:31.708 --> 07:46:31.718 align:start position:0%
floor amendment to 20 78h to S
 
07:46:35.788 --> 07:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
sp505 um the farm bill of 2018
 
07:46:38.150 --> 07:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
unintentionally created a loophole that
 
07:46:40.788 --> 07:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
legalized the sale of the psychoactive
 
07:46:44.388 --> 07:46:44.398 align:start position:0%
THC isomer products like uh Delta 8 and
 
07:46:47.910 --> 07:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 THC and there isn't much of a
 
07:46:49.628 --> 07:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
market for these products in states
 
07:46:51.990 --> 07:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
where marijuana has been legalized but
 
07:46:54.990 --> 07:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
in States like New Hampshire they found
 
07:46:57.708 --> 07:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
a booming market and the problem is that
 
07:47:00.110 --> 07:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
these products are completely
 
07:47:02.230 --> 07:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
unregulated acidic residue from the
 
07:47:04.430 --> 07:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
solve and extraction process often
 
07:47:06.510 --> 07:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
remains behind for consumption and there
 
07:47:09.548 --> 07:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
are few if any toxicology reports that
 
07:47:12.308 --> 07:47:12.318 align:start position:0%
have been done with any scientific rigor
 
07:47:15.388 --> 07:47:15.398 align:start position:0%
so in 2021 to 2022 there are over 2,000
 
07:47:17.548 --> 07:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
reports to poison control related to
 
07:47:20.030 --> 07:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
these products and are often marketed to
 
07:47:23.388 --> 07:47:23.398 align:start position:0%
children as candy bottom line this is
 
07:47:26.468 --> 07:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
bad stuff this is not the Homegrown or
 
07:47:28.468 --> 07:47:28.478 align:start position:0%
regulated cannabis that we've been
 
07:47:30.990 --> 07:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
talking talking about in our discussions
 
07:47:35.030 --> 07:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
about cannabis legislation Matt Simon of
 
07:47:37.270 --> 07:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
Granite State cannabis who is we know
 
07:47:39.788 --> 07:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
has been a longtime advocate for
 
07:47:42.750 --> 07:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization he testified as to
 
07:47:45.830 --> 07:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
the dangers of these products so last
 
07:47:48.230 --> 07:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
October a ban on these products went
 
07:47:50.788 --> 07:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
into effect which is going to expire
 
07:47:54.628 --> 07:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
this coming October now the unamended uh
 
07:47:56.590 --> 07:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh bill is going to make that ban
 
07:47:58.910 --> 07:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
permanent and while most of the folks on
 
07:48:01.270 --> 07:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
the HHS committee agreed that we don't
 
07:48:02.868 --> 07:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
want to see these products being
 
07:48:05.788 --> 07:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
marketed to kids a significant portion
 
07:48:07.628 --> 07:48:07.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee also you know looking
 
07:48:10.308 --> 07:48:10.318 align:start position:0%
at the history of of how permanent
 
07:48:12.628 --> 07:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
prohibitions work you know they felt
 
07:48:15.270 --> 07:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
that that might be a bit problematic so
 
07:48:17.388 --> 07:48:17.398 align:start position:0%
what this floor Amendment does this
 
07:48:19.430 --> 07:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment takes a Middle Road and
 
07:48:22.910 --> 07:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
extends the prohibition by three years
 
07:48:26.628 --> 07:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
until October of 2027 so what can we do
 
07:48:28.948 --> 07:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
with that three years with the
 
07:48:30.910 --> 07:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
discussions about the Cannabis legis
 
07:48:33.030 --> 07:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
legalization still in flux that
 
07:48:35.270 --> 07:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
additional three years might see the
 
07:48:37.030 --> 07:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis and the
 
07:48:38.830 --> 07:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent drying up of the isomer
 
07:48:41.270 --> 07:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
market in lie of that it might also see
 
07:48:43.070 --> 07:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
the development of a regulatory
 
07:48:45.708 --> 07:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
framework that could lead to uh a safer
 
07:48:49.190 --> 07:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
product for adult use so I think that
 
07:48:51.830 --> 07:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
the floor Amendment strikes a good
 
07:48:54.190 --> 07:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
balance a solid compromise that most
 
07:48:56.388 --> 07:48:56.398 align:start position:0%
people can get behind it's not a
 
07:48:58.308 --> 07:48:58.318 align:start position:0%
permanent prohibition but it gives us
 
07:49:00.150 --> 07:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
some room to breathe and I hope you'll
 
07:49:03.308 --> 07:49:03.318 align:start position:0%
support it thank you Mr Speaker Cher and
 
07:49:06.868 --> 07:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:10.110 --> 07:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr Speaker and Mr
 
07:49:12.510 --> 07:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker I agree with absolutely
 
07:49:14.868 --> 07:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
everything my colleague just said he
 
07:49:17.388 --> 07:49:17.398 align:start position:0%
gave you a very very careful and
 
07:49:20.830 --> 07:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
thorough discussion of the
 
07:49:22.948 --> 07:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
problem here's the
 
07:49:29.388 --> 07:49:29.398 align:start position:0%
thing a year ago we passed a bill
 
07:49:31.910 --> 07:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
that prohibited the sale of these
 
07:49:34.708 --> 07:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
products and as you've heard that will
 
07:49:37.230 --> 07:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
sunset in
 
07:49:39.510 --> 07:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
October we don't know what's going to
 
07:49:42.030 --> 07:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
happen with all the other bills I
 
07:49:44.150 --> 07:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with my colleagues that
 
07:49:46.670 --> 07:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
what we ought to do
 
07:49:50.430 --> 07:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
is when one of the other policies that
 
07:49:52.990 --> 07:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
we have passed in this body passes it
 
07:49:56.150 --> 07:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
will take care of the whole problem but
 
07:49:59.468 --> 07:49:59.478 align:start position:0%
in the meantime it seems
 
07:50:01.990 --> 07:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
something of a waste of our time and
 
07:50:05.230 --> 07:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
energy knowing that these products and
 
07:50:08.030 --> 07:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
agreeing that these products are
 
07:50:12.430 --> 07:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
problematical for us to continue to put
 
07:50:15.868 --> 07:50:15.878 align:start position:0%
sunsets that may or may not have to be
 
07:50:15.878 --> 07:50:17.070 align:start position:0%
sunsets that may or may not have to be
um

07:50:17.070 --> 07:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:50:21.190 --> 07:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
Extended let's not vote for this
 
07:50:24.910 --> 07:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
amendment so that the ban can be
 
07:50:27.308 --> 07:50:27.318 align:start position:0%
permanent until whatever future
 
07:50:27.318 --> 07:50:28.830 align:start position:0%
permanent until whatever future
legislature

07:50:28.830 --> 07:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
07:50:31.628 --> 07:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
decides to take whatever action they
 
07:50:34.030 --> 07:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
want to take based on current
 
07:50:37.230 --> 07:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances at that time so I ask you
 
07:50:39.708 --> 07:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
to press the red button to defeat the
 
07:50:43.030 --> 07:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment so that we can go on to
 
07:50:46.190 --> 07:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
a motion of V to pass thank
 
07:50:48.708 --> 07:50:48.718 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
07:52:35.788 --> 07:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
current ban on THC iser products will
 
07:52:38.350 --> 07:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
expire in October of this year unless it
 
07:52:41.270 --> 07:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
is extended but if I know that permanent
 
07:52:43.308 --> 07:52:43.318 align:start position:0%
prohibitions have often been shown to
 
07:52:45.510 --> 07:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
problematic we problematic and that the
 
07:52:47.150 --> 07:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
wider discussion about cannabis
 
07:52:49.708 --> 07:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
legalization is still ongoing but I now
 
07:52:52.030 --> 07:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
support floor amendment
 
07:52:54.510 --> 07:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
20788 to extend the prohibition on these
 
07:52:56.670 --> 07:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
products for three years until a final
 
07:52:58.548 --> 07:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
Direction becomes clearer thank you Mr

the problem we're just a little off on
 
07:53:13.030 --> 07:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
the solution would
 
07:53:17.830 --> 07:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
I vote would um would I

if I know that we agree on the solution
 
07:53:36.190 --> 07:53:36.200 align:start position:0%

last for and if I'm in favor of

further Amendment representative proud
 
07:55:01.868 --> 07:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
offers for Amendment
 
07:55:06.070 --> 07:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:08.350 --> 07:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you Mr
 
07:55:10.548 --> 07:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
Speaker this floor amend would add the
 
07:55:16.110 --> 07:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
house version of HB 1633 to Senate Bill
 
07:55:19.708 --> 07:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
505 House Bill 1633 is the bill to
 
07:55:21.430 --> 07:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
legalize recreational sales of cannabis
 
07:55:23.628 --> 07:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
that passed this body last
 
07:55:25.750 --> 07:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
month when you hear talk about cannabis
 
07:55:26.868 --> 07:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
is usually referring to products with
 
07:55:29.190 --> 07:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
enough Delta 9 THC to be intoxicating
 
07:55:31.468 --> 07:55:31.478 align:start position:0%
however there's other variants of TC
 
07:55:33.070 --> 07:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
that also have an intoxicating effect
 
07:55:34.990 --> 07:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
such as Delta a TC which is the subject
 
07:55:37.788 --> 07:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
of the underlying bill as both this
 
07:55:39.230 --> 07:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
amendment and the underlying Bill are
 
07:55:41.430 --> 07:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
about the legal status of cannabis it
 
07:55:42.788 --> 07:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
makes sense to combine them for a
 
07:55:44.350 --> 07:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
holistic discussion on the availability
 
07:55:46.150 --> 07:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
of legal cannabis in New
 
07:55:48.670 --> 07:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Delta hthc is interesting
 
07:55:50.468 --> 07:55:50.478 align:start position:0%
another way is federally legal as the
 
07:55:53.070 --> 07:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
previous speaker mentioned and uh was
 
07:55:54.670 --> 07:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
being sold in New Hampshire until House
 
07:55:56.990 --> 07:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 611 was enacted last
 
07:55:59.510 --> 07:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
year it was Federal legalized as part of
 
07:56:02.468 --> 07:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
the bill that permitted Industrial Hemp
 
07:56:04.030 --> 07:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
my wife recently went to JazzFest in New
 
07:56:07.190 --> 07:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
Orleans without me and she tells me that
 
07:56:10.590 --> 07:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
it was commercially for sale
 
07:56:13.070 --> 07:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere this is despite Louisiana not
 
07:56:16.388 --> 07:56:16.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:18.190 --> 07:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
Cannabis however this floor Amendment
 
07:56:19.708 --> 07:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
and the L Bill are more related than
 
07:56:19.718 --> 07:56:20.590 align:start position:0%
and the L Bill are more related than
just

07:56:20.590 --> 07:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:56:23.670 --> 07:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
that sp505 repeals the one-year Sunset
 
07:56:26.830 --> 07:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
clause on the New Hampshire Delta 8 THC
 
07:56:28.590 --> 07:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
prohibition this clause lause was
 
07:56:32.350 --> 07:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
included in House Bill 611 last year uh
 
07:56:33.830 --> 07:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
because of House Bill 611 last year was
 
07:56:34.868 --> 07:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
the commission to figure out how to
 
07:56:37.030 --> 07:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis and it was expected
 
07:56:38.750 --> 07:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
that the final legalization strategy
 
07:56:41.788 --> 07:56:41.798 align:start position:0%
would cover both variants of THC myself
 
07:56:43.230 --> 07:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
and others did not speak out against
 
07:56:45.190 --> 07:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 611 last year because this
 
07:56:47.388 --> 07:56:47.398 align:start position:0%
was reasonable take a one-year pause
 
07:56:49.070 --> 07:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
while we make a holistic plan that
 
07:56:51.868 --> 07:56:51.878 align:start position:0%
addresses the legal sale of both
 
07:56:54.070 --> 07:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
variants this floor Amendment gets us
 
07:56:55.708 --> 07:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
back to that plan to address address
 
07:56:58.468 --> 07:56:58.478 align:start position:0%
both variants together as we all know
 
07:57:00.110 --> 07:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
the commission failed to produce a plan
 
07:57:01.830 --> 07:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
and the fate of the actual house bill
 
07:57:03.708 --> 07:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
1633 which is in the hands of the body
 
07:57:06.230 --> 07:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the wall is
 
07:57:08.388 --> 07:57:08.398 align:start position:0%
uncertain but by passing this floor
 
07:57:10.070 --> 07:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment this body can stand firm on
 
07:57:11.590 --> 07:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
its position from a year ago that we
 
07:57:13.350 --> 07:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
need a comprehensive plan to address the
 
07:57:15.628 --> 07:57:15.638 align:start position:0%
legalization campus and reject the
 
07:57:17.350 --> 07:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill's notion of dealing with
 
07:57:21.308 --> 07:57:21.318 align:start position:0%
these variants of THC peace meal I Ur

and forth with the other body which has
 
07:58:02.430 --> 07:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately taken a stance which is in

08:05:10.948 --> 08:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
people still believe in
 
08:05:13.670 --> 08:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
science this amendment enables public
 
08:05:15.110 --> 08:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
reassurance through
 
08:05:18.590 --> 08:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
transparency simply put um prior to any
 
08:05:21.350 --> 08:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
authorization of a vaccine by the
 
08:05:24.628 --> 08:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh this amendment will ask
 
08:05:26.270 --> 08:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
that they verify the available
 
08:05:29.190 --> 08:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
scientific data supports vaccines claims
 
08:05:31.910 --> 08:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
for safety and efficacy and post a
 
08:05:33.868 --> 08:05:33.878 align:start position:0%
publicly available report on the
 
08:05:36.388 --> 08:05:36.398 align:start position:0%
findings of their review prior to the
 
08:05:36.398 --> 08:05:37.548 align:start position:0%
findings of their review prior to the
commissioner's

08:05:37.548 --> 08:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner's
 
08:05:40.430 --> 08:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
authorization and lastly it requires
 
08:05:42.190 --> 08:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
that the vaccine
 
08:05:44.788 --> 08:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
Association uh video record all their
 
08:05:47.270 --> 08:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
meetings in their entirety and make
 
08:05:49.230 --> 08:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
those recordings available to the public
 
08:05:51.948 --> 08:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
that is not being done right now and I
 
08:05:54.150 --> 08:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
ask for a roll call thank
 
08:06:00.590 --> 08:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:01.990 --> 08:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
08:06:05.990 --> 08:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:10.670 --> 08:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
have let me back up uh the problems with
 
08:06:14.190 --> 08:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment is written is that prior
 
08:06:17.590 --> 08:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
to authorization the DHHS has to review
 
08:06:20.788 --> 08:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
all available summaries verify all
 
08:06:23.388 --> 08:06:23.398 align:start position:0%
available scientific data for safety and
 
08:06:26.910 --> 08:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency post a report the vaccine
 
08:06:26.920 --> 08:06:28.308 align:start position:0%
efficiency post a report the vaccine
Association

08:06:28.308 --> 08:06:28.318 align:start position:0%
Association
 
08:06:31.110 --> 08:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
must uh record all their meetings and
 
08:06:33.468 --> 08:06:33.478 align:start position:0%
make them available to the public
 
08:06:35.910 --> 08:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
there's no provision for extra work for
 
08:06:41.590 --> 08:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
the DHHS staff and there's ample time
 
08:06:44.388 --> 08:06:44.398 align:start position:0%
and reason because the language of the
 
08:06:47.910 --> 08:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill is so unclear for people to
 
08:06:50.190 --> 08:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
challenge whether the department has
 
08:06:53.590 --> 08:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
done enough or have they reviewed
 
08:06:56.190 --> 08:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
everything and they must review other
 
08:07:00.350 --> 08:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
things the bill is very simple and it it
 
08:07:05.150 --> 08:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
now applies to only one vaccine the RSV
 
08:07:05.160 --> 08:07:07.230 align:start position:0%
now applies to only one vaccine the RSV
vaccine

08:07:07.230 --> 08:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
08:07:10.230 --> 08:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
children mostly older children and
 
08:07:13.868 --> 08:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
adults it's just a cold but for infants
 
08:07:16.868 --> 08:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
RSV results in
 
08:07:16.878 --> 08:07:18.868 align:start position:0%
RSV results in
hospitalization

08:07:18.868 --> 08:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
hospitalization
 
08:07:23.868 --> 08:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
and it um can be really terrifying for
 
08:07:26.910 --> 08:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
both the parents and the child the bill
 
08:07:30.830 --> 08:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
only authorizes that one
 
08:07:33.750 --> 08:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine and we've heard that That
 
08:07:37.070 --> 08:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine has been tested as being highly
 
08:07:37.080 --> 08:07:38.308 align:start position:0%
vaccine has been tested as being highly
effective

08:07:38.308 --> 08:07:38.318 align:start position:0%
effective
 
08:07:41.388 --> 08:07:41.398 align:start position:0%
90% against RSV Associated
 
08:07:43.510 --> 08:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalization in infants entering
 
08:07:46.750 --> 08:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
their first RSV season is it perfect it
 
08:07:50.110 --> 08:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
is not do you have to give it to your
 
08:07:55.510 --> 08:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
child you do not but because we are only
 
08:07:58.628 --> 08:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
talking about one
 
08:08:02.430 --> 08:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
specific type of
 
08:08:05.510 --> 08:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
inoculation there is no need for all of
 
08:08:07.708 --> 08:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
these reviews and studies and other
 
08:08:10.388 --> 08:08:10.398 align:start position:0%
things I hope you will vote this
 
08:08:13.510 --> 08:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
amendment down so we can proceed to the

08:10:02.230 --> 08:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
order thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
08:10:03.948 --> 08:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire vaccine
 
08:10:07.308 --> 08:10:07.318 align:start position:0%
Association is already able to pay for
 
08:10:09.830 --> 08:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines and if I know that the RSV
 
08:10:12.628 --> 08:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine is not actually a vaccine which
 
08:10:15.230 --> 08:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
is why this bill is needed and if I
 
08:10:18.150 --> 08:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
further know that because of the lack of
 
08:10:19.868 --> 08:10:19.878 align:start position:0%
information around this this floor
 
08:10:22.910 --> 08:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment provides necessary Clarity so
 
08:10:24.868 --> 08:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
that people can begin to have greater
 
08:10:27.830 --> 08:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
trust in the system what I then support
 
08:10:30.430 --> 08:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
this floor Amendment so we can better
 
08:10:32.350 --> 08:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
understand what we are putting into our
 
08:10:34.868 --> 08:10:34.878 align:start position:0%

08:10:50.708 --> 08:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
is requested here has already been done
 
08:10:53.308 --> 08:10:53.318 align:start position:0%
and we know that this vaccine is
 
08:10:56.230 --> 08:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
effective in many many many cases and I
 
08:11:00.190 --> 08:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
know that is still matter of choice but
 
08:11:02.670 --> 08:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
I know that we simply need to progress
 
08:11:05.830 --> 08:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
to the underlying bill to make a vaccine
 
08:11:10.548 --> 08:11:10.558 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker honorable
 
08:13:04.628 --> 08:13:04.638 align:start position:0%
colleagues respiratory sensal virus or
 
08:13:07.430 --> 08:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
RSV is a leading cause of severe lower
 
08:13:09.030 --> 08:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
respiratory tract disease in young
 
08:13:12.150 --> 08:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
children with approximately 1% to 3% of
 
08:13:14.468 --> 08:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
the children under 12 months of age in
 
08:13:16.230 --> 08:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
the United States being hospitalized
 
08:13:19.270 --> 08:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
each year due to RSV the bill before us
 
08:13:22.430 --> 08:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
under Roman numeral 9A ask us to make
 
08:13:24.830 --> 08:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
accessible a brand new RSV biological
 
08:13:27.150 --> 08:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
product that is approved by the FDA and
 
08:13:29.788 --> 08:13:29.798 align:start position:0%
recommended by the advisory committee on
 
08:13:32.590 --> 08:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
immunization practices from the CDC the
 
08:13:34.510 --> 08:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
bill asked for the administration of the
 
08:13:37.230 --> 08:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
RSV biological product to Children of
 
08:13:38.788 --> 08:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire under the age
 
08:13:41.308 --> 08:13:41.318 align:start position:0%
of 19 years for the purposes of
 
08:13:44.110 --> 08:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
protecting against RSV so I have a
 
08:13:45.830 --> 08:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
little objection to that this bill does
 
08:13:48.628 --> 08:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
not align with the approval of the FDA
 
08:13:50.350 --> 08:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
or the recommendation of the cdc's
 
08:13:52.750 --> 08:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
advisory committee what did the FDA
 
08:13:55.150 --> 08:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
approve and what did the CDC recommend
 
08:13:57.670 --> 08:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
so the CDC publishes a report report if
 
08:14:02.230 --> 08:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
I can get there um uh on a weekly basis
 
08:14:05.110 --> 08:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
and the report from August 25th 2023
 
08:14:08.190 --> 08:14:08.200 align:start position:0%
States in July 2023 the FDA approved
 
08:14:11.468 --> 08:14:11.478 align:start position:0%
nurse camab a long acting monoclonal an
 
08:14:13.468 --> 08:14:13.478 align:start position:0%
antibody for the prevention of RSV
 
08:14:15.590 --> 08:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
Associated lower respiratory tract
 
08:14:17.548 --> 08:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
infection among infants and children
 
08:14:19.868 --> 08:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
aged less than 24 months this was
 
08:14:22.948 --> 08:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
approved under the fda's FastTrack
 
08:14:25.350 --> 08:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
program which means there is much more
 
08:14:28.510 --> 08:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
limited data on this than normal
 
08:14:32.590 --> 08:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
approvals on August 3rd the CDC Advisory
 
08:14:34.788 --> 08:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
committee recommended Nur caab for
 
08:14:37.030 --> 08:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
infants aged less than eight months who
 
08:14:38.788 --> 08:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
are born during or entering their first
 
08:14:41.750 --> 08:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
RSV season and for infants and children
 
08:14:44.590 --> 08:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
aged 8 to 19 months who are at increased
 
08:14:48.110 --> 08:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
risk for severe RSV de disease and are
 
08:14:51.308 --> 08:14:51.318 align:start position:0%
entering their second RSV season so what
 
08:14:53.070 --> 08:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
are my issues with this bill one the
 
08:14:55.228 --> 08:14:55.238 align:start position:0%
bill is adding legislation where there
 
08:14:57.708 --> 08:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
is already sufficient access and two the
 
08:14:59.590 --> 08:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill is expanding access where it isn't
 
08:15:02.190 --> 08:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
needed first all infants already have
 
08:15:04.110 --> 08:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
access to an RSV immunization or
 
08:15:06.110 --> 08:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
treatment properly treatment since it's
 
08:15:08.228 --> 08:15:08.238 align:start position:0%
not a vaccine through Medicaid insurance
 
08:15:09.948 --> 08:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
and the federal vaccines for children
 
08:15:12.030 --> 08:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
program which is referenced in the
 
08:15:15.070 --> 08:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
existing legislation nurva maab was
 
08:15:18.308 --> 08:15:18.318 align:start position:0%
already on New Hampshire's DHHS Health
 
08:15:21.510 --> 08:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
alert back in August 2023 for infants up
 
08:15:24.750 --> 08:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
to 19 months second the product is not
 
08:15:27.510 --> 08:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
on the cdc's child and adolescent
 
08:15:30.308 --> 08:15:30.318 align:start position:0%
immunization schedule after 19 months
 
08:15:33.350 --> 08:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
the risk of RSV is for children under 24
 
08:15:35.548 --> 08:15:35.558 align:start position:0%
months not children and Adolescence up
 
08:15:37.708 --> 08:15:37.718 align:start position:0%
to 19 years of age so there are no
 
08:15:39.270 --> 08:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
clinical studies that would support
 
08:15:41.228 --> 08:15:41.238 align:start position:0%
safety and efficacy in the Adolescent
 
08:15:44.868 --> 08:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
population between ages two and 19 years
 
08:15:46.468 --> 08:15:46.478 align:start position:0%
now there's one more concern this
 
08:15:48.350 --> 08:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
product was F FASTT tracked through the
 
08:15:52.070 --> 08:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
FDA process and it lacks uh the full
 
08:15:54.070 --> 08:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
efficacy data we might see from normal
 
08:15:57.150 --> 08:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
clinical studies so why is this
 
08:15:59.030 --> 08:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
nonvaccine product now being
 
08:16:01.670 --> 08:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
fast-tracked through legislation with
 
08:16:04.708 --> 08:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
overly broad language I am concerned
 
08:16:06.270 --> 08:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
that the language in the bill before
 
08:16:09.430 --> 08:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
specifically 9A implies an immunization
 
08:16:12.708 --> 08:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
schedule beyond the federal CDC schedule
 
08:16:15.190 --> 08:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
of up to 19 months and it expands the
 
08:16:16.868 --> 08:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
common understanding of vaccine
 
08:16:19.590 --> 08:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
immunization to other types of
 
08:16:22.430 --> 08:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
treatments with nonvaccine products do
 
08:16:24.708 --> 08:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
that do not have the full safety and
 
08:16:27.110 --> 08:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
efficacy studies that other drug
 
08:16:30.388 --> 08:16:30.398 align:start position:0%
products and biologic products have so I
 
08:16:33.590 --> 08:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
would vote no on sp599 let the doctors
 
08:16:35.788 --> 08:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
administer the biological product to the
 
08:16:37.948 --> 08:16:37.958 align:start position:0%
demographics which with the product is
 
08:16:39.910 --> 08:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
already approved and let's not add
 
08:16:42.910 --> 08:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
language to the RSA that isn't necessary
 
08:16:46.270 --> 08:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
or supported by sufficient efficacy data
 
08:16:48.350 --> 08:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker chair recognize
 
08:16:48.360 --> 08:16:55.030 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker chair recognize
representor

08:16:55.030 --> 08:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:57.628 --> 08:16:57.638 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr Speaker so the
 
08:16:59.388 --> 08:16:59.398 align:start position:0%
previous speaker stole a lot of my
 
08:17:00.868 --> 08:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
thunder so I'm going to basically kind
 
08:17:03.350 --> 08:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
of try to pair it down a bit basically s
 
08:17:06.228 --> 08:17:06.238 align:start position:0%
SP 559 defines biological products for
 
08:17:08.350 --> 08:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
the purpose of assessment determination
 
08:17:10.388 --> 08:17:10.398 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
08:17:12.388 --> 08:17:12.398 align:start position:0%
so essentially it's allowing the
 
08:17:15.270 --> 08:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
association to procure and distribute an
 
08:17:18.070 --> 08:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
entirely new class of immun including as
 
08:17:20.110 --> 08:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
you heard the monoclonal antibody
 
08:17:22.628 --> 08:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
products such as the RSD
 
08:17:24.468 --> 08:17:24.478 align:start position:0%
vaccine one of the things we talked
 
08:17:25.670 --> 08:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
about and the majority of the community
 
08:17:27.228 --> 08:17:27.238 align:start position:0%
recognized is that there is
 
08:17:29.590 --> 08:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a widespread mistrust of
 
08:17:32.070 --> 08:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
vines that has grown up you know that
 
08:17:34.030 --> 08:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
came out of the covid crisis and they
 
08:17:35.910 --> 08:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
therefore felt that this time that the
 
08:17:37.628 --> 08:17:37.638 align:start position:0%
scope of the bill as originally written
 
08:17:39.788 --> 08:17:39.798 align:start position:0%
was far too broad and went further than
 
08:17:41.270 --> 08:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
many folks in New Hampshire would be
 
08:17:45.070 --> 08:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
ready to accept and so with that in mind
 
08:17:47.228 --> 08:17:47.238 align:start position:0%
the the amendment that we just passed
 
08:17:48.868 --> 08:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment is a huge
 
08:17:50.910 --> 08:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement because it really larrow
 
08:17:52.990 --> 08:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
that narrows that scope down to just
 
08:17:55.670 --> 08:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
look at the very very promising RSV
 
08:17:58.510 --> 08:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine um however the minority of the
 
08:18:00.228 --> 08:18:00.238 align:start position:0%
committee also felt that it would be
 
08:18:02.350 --> 08:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
prudent to take a pause before we go
 
08:18:04.590 --> 08:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
forward and the reason for that and was
 
08:18:06.228 --> 08:18:06.238 align:start position:0%
touched on a little bit is that the
 
08:18:07.948 --> 08:18:07.958 align:start position:0%
committee heard testimony that the
 
08:18:10.708 --> 08:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
efficacy data is still rather limited
 
08:18:12.510 --> 08:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
and is still being gathered but they
 
08:18:14.628 --> 08:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
also heard that the federal immunity
 
08:18:17.030 --> 08:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
language around immunizations has not
 
08:18:19.670 --> 08:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
yet been expanded to include these new
 
08:18:22.788 --> 08:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
biological immunization projects so we
 
08:18:24.750 --> 08:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
did the good news is we heard some
 
08:18:26.788 --> 08:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony that said the
 
08:18:28.868 --> 08:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
federal government is in the process of
 
08:18:31.388 --> 08:18:31.398 align:start position:0%
updating that language to include these
 
08:18:34.228 --> 08:18:34.238 align:start position:0%
products but that work is not yet
 
08:18:37.468 --> 08:18:37.478 align:start position:0%
complete it's still in the process so in
 
08:18:40.388 --> 08:18:40.398 align:start position:0%
spite of that given the potential for
 
08:18:42.350 --> 08:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
the RSV vaccine to present
 
08:18:44.150 --> 08:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
hospitalization in infants which we
 
08:18:46.990 --> 08:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
heard about a quick risk benefit
 
08:18:49.468 --> 08:18:49.478 align:start position:0%
analysis might lead a reasonable person
 
08:18:52.110 --> 08:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
maybe to put these concerns aside in
 
08:18:54.150 --> 08:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
favor of some of the promise that the
 
08:18:58.070 --> 08:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine offers however the fact is as
 
08:19:01.868 --> 08:19:01.878 align:start position:0%
was mentioned the RSV vaccine is already
 
08:19:05.030 --> 08:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
ready available to anybody who wants it
 
08:19:08.030 --> 08:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
with or without this bill if you go home
 
08:19:10.228 --> 08:19:10.238 align:start position:0%
tonight and you turn on your television
 
08:19:12.150 --> 08:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
set you're probably going to see a
 
08:19:15.270 --> 08:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
commercial for the RSV vaccine right
 
08:19:17.510 --> 08:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
next to a commercial for the shingles
 
08:19:20.350 --> 08:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine in fact if you want to immunize
 
08:19:22.590 --> 08:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
your infant it's already covered by
 
08:19:24.830 --> 08:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
private insurance and if your family
 
08:19:27.270 --> 08:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
limited means it's covered by Medical or
 
08:19:31.030 --> 08:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
as mentioned the federal vfc funding so
 
08:19:33.110 --> 08:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
given the ready availability of the RSB
 
08:19:35.430 --> 08:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine to any who want it the minority
 
08:19:37.228 --> 08:19:37.238 align:start position:0%
of the committee felt that it would be
 
08:19:39.868 --> 08:19:39.878 align:start position:0%
prudent to wait for the efficacy data
 
08:19:42.308 --> 08:19:42.318 align:start position:0%
and the updated Federal language before
 
08:19:44.548 --> 08:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
opening up the door to procurement to
 
08:19:46.708 --> 08:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
the vaccine Association so I hope that
 
08:19:47.868 --> 08:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
you'll support the minority of the
 
08:19:50.308 --> 08:19:50.318 align:start position:0%
committee in defeating the otpa motion
 
08:19:52.750 --> 08:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can go forward with an itl
 
08:19:55.070 --> 08:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
bottom line is we've got the time to do
 
08:19:57.350 --> 08:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
this right it's already available
 
08:20:00.270 --> 08:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
product already it's important that we
 
08:20:02.430 --> 08:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
begin the process of rebuilding public
 
08:20:05.070 --> 08:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
trust in this very important public
 
08:20:07.990 --> 08:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
health tool thank you Mr Speaker chair
 
08:20:15.830 --> 08:20:15.840 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker and fellow colleagues
 
08:20:22.350 --> 08:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
I come before you to ask for your
 
08:20:26.590 --> 08:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
support of SB 559 a simple bill as aend
 
08:20:30.110 --> 08:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
ended it adds one repeat one vaccine to
 
08:20:33.150 --> 08:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
the state Universal vaccine program the
 
08:20:34.910 --> 08:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
original Bill started out with a class
 
08:20:37.350 --> 08:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
of drugs called biologics the amendment
 
08:20:39.548 --> 08:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
reduced to one vaccine which was
 
08:20:41.708 --> 08:20:41.718 align:start position:0%
supported by the
 
08:20:45.110 --> 08:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee house Senate Bill 559 provides
 
08:20:49.190 --> 08:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
a simple technical fix to RSA
 
08:20:52.868 --> 08:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
126 q that will enable the New Hampshire
 
08:20:55.788 --> 08:20:55.798 align:start position:0%

payers
 
08:21:00.548 --> 08:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
for an already approved FDA
 
08:21:02.868 --> 08:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine that will prevent undue
 
08:21:05.708 --> 08:21:05.718 align:start position:0%
suffering to infants young children and
 
08:21:05.718 --> 08:21:07.510 align:start position:0%

in children under the age of
 
08:21:21.468 --> 08:21:21.478 align:start position:0%
five it's a lot of
 
08:21:23.948 --> 08:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
children approximately 75% of the
 
08:21:26.228 --> 08:21:26.238 align:start position:0%
infants who are hospitalized with RSV
 
08:21:29.350 --> 08:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
were born healthy and at term with no

of their child affects their mental
 
08:21:42.708 --> 08:21:42.718 align:start position:0%

providers and insurance carriers passing
 
08:21:59.030 --> 08:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
s sp5 59 will allow providers to offer

the same immunizations to all parents
 
08:22:05.628 --> 08:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
regardless of their insurance or lack of
 
08:22:07.868 --> 08:22:07.878 align:start position:0%
insurance provides
 
08:22:10.548 --> 08:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
equality as a government entity the
 
08:22:13.388 --> 08:22:13.398 align:start position:0%
state may utilize Federal contracts that
 
08:22:15.548 --> 08:22:15.558 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the cost of the
 
08:22:19.708 --> 08:22:19.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine from $500 to $400 a significant
 
08:22:22.510 --> 08:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
savings that can be helped to reduce
 
08:22:25.468 --> 08:22:25.478 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums at no cost to the
 
08:22:29.750 --> 08:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
state at no cost to the state for these
 
08:22:31.788 --> 08:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
reasons I ask that you support the
 
08:22:33.388 --> 08:22:33.398 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation that simply
 
08:22:35.150 --> 08:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
adds one
 
08:22:35.160 --> 08:22:37.070 align:start position:0%
adds one
vaccine

08:22:37.070 --> 08:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
08:22:39.628 --> 08:22:39.638 align:start position:0%
and support it by pushing the green
 
08:22:41.948 --> 08:22:41.958 align:start position:0%
button at the same time I'd ask for a
 
08:22:41.958 --> 08:22:48.628 align:start position:0%
button at the same time I'd ask for a
division

08:22:48.628 --> 08:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:51.110 --> 08:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
vote a division has been requested
 
08:22:55.430 --> 08:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:44.750 --> 08:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:46.990 --> 08:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is a to pass as
 
08:23:49.830 --> 08:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
amended on Senate Bill 559 they say
 
08:23:52.548 --> 08:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
division vote chair recognize represent
 
08:23:57.430 --> 08:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:59.990 --> 08:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
08:24:01.308 --> 08:24:01.318 align:start position:0%
know that the committee amendment makes
 
08:24:03.030 --> 08:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill much better by
 
08:24:04.788 --> 08:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
narrowing the scope of the original bill
 
08:24:08.628 --> 08:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
down to Jesse RSV vaccine but if I know
 
08:24:10.830 --> 08:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
also that the efficacy data and the
 
08:24:12.990 --> 08:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
updated Federal immunity language are
 
08:24:15.708 --> 08:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
still pending and if I know that even
 
08:24:18.308 --> 08:24:18.318 align:start position:0%
without this bill access to the RSV
 
08:24:21.110 --> 08:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine is widespread covered by private
 
08:24:23.388 --> 08:24:23.398 align:start position:0%
insurance Medicaid and the federal
 
08:24:25.670 --> 08:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine for children program would I now
 
08:24:28.150 --> 08:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
press the red button so that we can take
 
08:24:30.430 --> 08:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
a brief pause and introduce this very
 
08:24:32.750 --> 08:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
important immunization in a way that
 
08:24:34.948 --> 08:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
rebuilds essential trust with the people
 
08:24:37.468 --> 08:24:37.478 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire thank you Mr Speaker

I know that hospitalization of infants

financial burdens to many families now

committee Amendment for at least five
 
08:29:31.910 --> 08:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
reasons first the committee Amendment
 
08:29:35.990 --> 08:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
proposes the same setback that was
 
08:29:39.388 --> 08:29:39.398 align:start position:0%
previously in this house that was tabled
 
08:29:42.350 --> 08:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
second the proposed setback restriction
 
08:29:46.228 --> 08:29:46.238 align:start position:0%
is unsafe for boers it pushes these
 
08:29:49.228 --> 08:29:49.238 align:start position:0%
water sports into more congested areas
 
08:29:51.388 --> 08:29:51.398 align:start position:0%
for recreation that will create
 
08:29:53.228 --> 08:29:53.238 align:start position:0%
dangerous and
 
08:29:56.548 --> 08:29:56.558 align:start position:0%
unsafe conditions number three
 
08:29:59.150 --> 08:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
three the amendment further limits
 
08:30:02.150 --> 08:30:02.160 align:start position:0%

four this bill as amended will not
 
08:30:09.628 --> 08:30:09.638 align:start position:0%
likely pass the other
 
08:30:12.670 --> 08:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
body number five this bill offers less
 
08:30:15.070 --> 08:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
education than the prime
 
08:30:18.670 --> 08:30:18.680 align:start position:0%

08:30:20.948 --> 08:30:20.958 align:start position:0%

ourselves and future Generations we
 
08:31:09.548 --> 08:31:09.558 align:start position:0%

the distance from Shore that wake

only a 50 feet more than exists
 
08:31:45.750 --> 08:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
today this amendment that you're going
 
08:31:48.830 --> 08:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
to vote on will increase the setback to
 
08:31:52.270 --> 08:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
300 feet and ensure that there is
 
08:31:55.030 --> 08:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
adequate depth and deep water to prevent
 
08:31:58.070 --> 08:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
deterioration of the lake we must
 
08:32:00.750 --> 08:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
prevent the churning of the bottom that
 
08:32:03.628 --> 08:32:03.638 align:start position:0%
the powerful downdraft thrust of a

08:32:08.990 --> 08:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
disturbing the lake Bottom has been
 
08:32:11.708 --> 08:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
shown to contribute to cob bacteria

69 warnings of cob bacteria last year
 
08:32:43.830 --> 08:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
alone and in the first three months of
 
08:32:46.110 --> 08:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
this year since the ice went out there
 
08:32:48.868 --> 08:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
have been four already churning up the
 
08:32:51.670 --> 08:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
bottom also disturbs fish
 
08:32:54.990 --> 08:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
beds having a distance for surfing set
 
08:32:59.190 --> 08:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
at 300 fet will allow the powerful waves
 
08:33:03.070 --> 08:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
created by by wake boats to dissipate
 
08:33:05.590 --> 08:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
before they Rec a dock it will lessen
 
08:33:08.190 --> 08:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
the erosion that is created by the waves
 
08:33:10.708 --> 08:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
that these boats generate and these
 
08:33:13.308 --> 08:33:13.318 align:start position:0%
dissipated waves are less likely to
 
08:33:16.070 --> 08:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
overturn a paddle booat or a kayak
 
08:33:18.750 --> 08:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be less impact on Lon nests and
 
08:33:20.510 --> 08:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
other protected
 
08:33:24.388 --> 08:33:24.398 align:start position:0%
species we can cannot do anything about
 
08:33:28.350 --> 08:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
wind or natural storms but we can listen
 
08:33:31.070 --> 08:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
the impact of these waves without
 
08:33:34.150 --> 08:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
hindering the enjoyment of the sport we
 
08:33:38.590 --> 08:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
can be proactive without Banning an
 
08:33:42.468 --> 08:33:42.478 align:start position:0%
enjoyment a 300 set foot setback will
 
08:33:45.350 --> 08:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
support a variety of water activities
 
08:33:48.350 --> 08:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
without the fear of large waves
 
08:33:51.628 --> 08:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
non-motorized users of our Lakes will
 
08:33:54.510 --> 08:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
also find the enlarged area less
 
08:33:54.520 --> 08:33:57.150 align:start position:0%
also find the enlarged area less
intimidating

08:33:57.150 --> 08:33:57.160 align:start position:0%

08:34:03.830 --> 08:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
surfing and swimming are just some of
 
08:34:06.228 --> 08:34:06.238 align:start position:0%
the recreational opportunities that will

be enhanced with a 300 foot
 
08:34:12.468 --> 08:34:12.478 align:start position:0%
setback this setback already exists for
 
08:34:17.510 --> 08:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
p passenger jet skis at 300 ft and would
 
08:34:20.948 --> 08:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
be consistent for Marine Patrol to
 
08:34:23.990 --> 08:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
enforce I want our Lakes to be as clear
 
08:34:26.228 --> 08:34:26.238 align:start position:0%
and pure as they are today
 
08:34:29.590 --> 08:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
for my children and grandchildren and
 
08:34:33.670 --> 08:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
yours if we do nothing time will spoil
 
08:34:36.430 --> 08:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
what we so love the water will not be
 
08:34:39.708 --> 08:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
ruined today or tomorrow but each day
 
08:34:41.910 --> 08:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
that goes by without intervention and
 
08:34:44.590 --> 08:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
protection will hasten the deaths of our
 
08:34:47.910 --> 08:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
lakes and many of you do not know this
 
08:34:50.228 --> 08:34:50.238 align:start position:0%
but I'm a manager of a
 
08:34:53.948 --> 08:34:53.958 align:start position:0%
5065 excuse me slip Marina that sells
 
08:34:57.548 --> 08:34:57.558 align:start position:0%
over 20,000 gallons of gas a year I do
 
08:35:01.030 --> 08:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
not want to ban any type of boating I
 
08:35:03.228 --> 08:35:03.238 align:start position:0%
love it when one of those jet skis comes
 
08:35:07.868 --> 08:35:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:11.468 --> 08:35:11.478 align:start position:0%
boat I make a living from the lake and
 
08:35:13.788 --> 08:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
just like the Marine trades we want it
 
08:35:13.798 --> 08:35:14.670 align:start position:0%
just like the Marine trades we want it
to

08:35:14.670 --> 08:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:35:18.708 --> 08:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
exist having a 300 foot setback does not
 
08:35:22.708 --> 08:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
ban wake surfing or prevent anybody from
 
08:35:25.708 --> 08:35:25.718 align:start position:0%
using or selling a weight board but but
 
08:35:28.510 --> 08:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's a reasonable compromise that will
 
08:35:30.830 --> 08:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
help ensure the future health of our
 
08:35:33.830 --> 08:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
lakes that provide me and many others
 
08:35:34.788 --> 08:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
with a
 
08:35:37.788 --> 08:35:37.798 align:start position:0%
living it's time to look forward to
 
08:35:40.670 --> 08:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
support to protect and enhance our
 
08:35:44.590 --> 08:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
greatest natural asset our Lakes we can
 
08:35:47.868 --> 08:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
make a difference and we must do it now
 
08:35:51.030 --> 08:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker I request a division
 
08:35:55.788 --> 08:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:57.948 --> 08:35:57.958 align:start position:0%

08:38:02.510 --> 08:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:05.750 --> 08:38:05.760 align:start position:0%

08:38:17.070 --> 08:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
08:38:20.868 --> 08:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that a 300 foot
 
08:38:23.910 --> 08:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
setback in the committee amendment was
 
08:38:27.548 --> 08:38:27.558 align:start position:0%
already tabled already tabled in this
 
08:38:30.030 --> 08:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
house and is of concern to the Boating
 
08:38:34.190 --> 08:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
and in and tourism industry and if I
 
08:38:36.190 --> 08:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
know that voting down the committee
 
08:38:38.670 --> 08:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment will bring us back to the
 
08:38:41.910 --> 08:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill that actually has a
 
08:38:45.030 --> 08:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
chance of passing and doing some good
 
08:38:48.228 --> 08:38:48.238 align:start position:0%
for our waterways waterways then would I
 
08:38:51.788 --> 08:38:51.798 align:start position:0%
now push the red button and vote against
 
08:38:54.430 --> 08:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
the poison pill committee amendments so
 
08:38:58.510 --> 08:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
we can find a winwin on this issue it is
 
08:39:04.388 --> 08:39:04.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:39:07.030 --> 08:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
red chair recognizes representative L
 
08:39:11.750 --> 08:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:39:17.468 --> 08:39:17.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:39:20.228 --> 08:39:20.238 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this amendment is
 
08:39:22.910 --> 08:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
not a ban but creates a reasonable
 
08:39:22.920 --> 08:39:23.990 align:start position:0%
not a ban but creates a reasonable
buffer

08:39:23.990 --> 08:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
buffer
 
08:39:27.948 --> 08:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
zone and that huge areas of nearly every
 
08:39:29.830 --> 08:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lake would still be open
 
08:39:32.750 --> 08:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
to wake surfing and certainly not
 
08:39:35.430 --> 08:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
overcrowded and if I knew that the 300
 
08:39:38.830 --> 08:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
foot setback represents a meaningful
 
08:39:41.910 --> 08:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan compromise between wake
 
08:39:45.308 --> 08:39:45.318 align:start position:0%
surfing other forms of recreation and
 
08:39:46.750 --> 08:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
the health of the
 
08:39:48.868 --> 08:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
lake and that
 
08:39:52.830 --> 08:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
unamended this bill shows no compromise
 
08:39:55.948 --> 08:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
at all among all these interests
 
08:39:58.990 --> 08:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
and if I knew that if we do nothing to
 
08:40:02.070 --> 08:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
mitigate the damage of wake surfing we
 
08:40:04.868 --> 08:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
will end up destroying our beautiful
 
08:40:04.878 --> 08:40:06.990 align:start position:0%
will end up destroying our beautiful
natural

08:40:06.990 --> 08:40:07.000 align:start position:0%

08:40:09.708 --> 08:40:09.718 align:start position:0%

08:40:14.030 --> 08:40:14.040 align:start position:0%

08:40:17.718 --> 08:40:19.228 align:start position:0%

loons
 
08:40:22.868 --> 08:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
and if I knew we received overwhelming
 
08:40:25.388 --> 08:40:25.398 align:start position:0%
emails from New Hampshire residents
 
08:40:29.150 --> 08:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
imploring us to amend this bill to 300
 
08:40:33.350 --> 08:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
ft and if I knew that creating ocean
 
08:40:36.830 --> 08:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
waves in small New Hampshire Lakes is
 
08:40:39.868 --> 08:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
very damaging to their ecosystems and we
 
08:40:43.548 --> 08:40:43.558 align:start position:0%
must do something to protect them would
 
08:40:46.708 --> 08:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
I now press the green button to pass
 
08:40:52.308 --> 08:40:52.318 align:start position:0%

another 500 ft from the original bill

testimony in our hearings that it it
 
08:43:25.270 --> 08:43:25.280 align:start position:0%

intentions of the house special

08:50:48.350 --> 08:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
to respectfully object to the committee
 
08:50:50.868 --> 08:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
amendment to SB
 
08:50:52.910 --> 08:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
527 Amendment
 
08:50:56.430 --> 08:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
1752 attaches similar language to that
 
08:50:58.070 --> 08:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
of hb1
 
08:51:00.510 --> 08:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
1281 which was tabled by the house in
 
08:51:02.910 --> 08:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
March and essentially prohibits the
 
08:51:05.590 --> 08:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
adoption or enforcement of any code
 
08:51:08.270 --> 08:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance or regulation related to the
 
08:51:11.590 --> 08:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
occupancy of residential rental property
 
08:51:13.270 --> 08:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
that restricts the number of occupants
 
08:51:15.990 --> 08:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
to less than two people per bedroom upon
 
08:51:18.628 --> 08:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend for a minute
 
08:51:21.868 --> 08:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
let's hear her the end is in sight the
 
08:51:24.030 --> 08:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
fewer interruptions we have the quicker
 
08:51:28.670 --> 08:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:30.990 --> 08:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
continue which restricts the number of
 
08:51:32.788 --> 08:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
occupants to less than two people per
 
08:51:35.070 --> 08:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
bedroom based upon the existence of
 
08:51:38.270 --> 08:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
unrelated or nonfamilial relationships
 
08:51:39.548 --> 08:51:39.558 align:start position:0%
between those
 
08:51:42.388 --> 08:51:42.398 align:start position:0%
occupants as a real estate attorney it
 
08:51:44.350 --> 08:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the beneficiaries of
 
08:51:47.030 --> 08:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment will be landlords
 
08:51:48.990 --> 08:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
landlords who own residential rental
 
08:51:51.548 --> 08:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
properties in college towns that want to
 
08:51:54.228 --> 08:51:54.238 align:start position:0%
raise profits by packing students into a
 
08:51:56.548 --> 08:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
room rental agreement without concern
 
08:51:59.948 --> 08:51:59.958 align:start position:0%
for buding Neighbors Town culture or
 
08:52:03.030 --> 08:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
health and safety notice who does not
 
08:52:06.150 --> 08:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
benefit from this amendment students
 
08:52:08.190 --> 08:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
won't benefit when they're packed like
 
08:52:11.308 --> 08:52:11.318 align:start position:0%
sardines into room rentals where there's
 
08:52:13.350 --> 08:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
an increasing number of housemates and a
 
08:52:15.270 --> 08:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
decreasing amount of
 
08:52:18.110 --> 08:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
privacy college towns won't benefit by
 
08:52:19.750 --> 08:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
this change when they lose their local
 
08:52:24.070 --> 08:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
control and sadly Working Families won't
 
08:52:26.070 --> 08:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
benefit as they struggle to find
 
08:52:28.468 --> 08:52:28.478 align:start position:0%
affordable homes in the same college
 
08:52:30.948 --> 08:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
towns when more homes are removed from
 
08:52:32.788 --> 08:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
the market and converted into student
 
08:52:35.190 --> 08:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
housing which exacerbates the exact
 
08:52:37.910 --> 08:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
housing crisis we're worried about now
 
08:52:39.990 --> 08:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to represent Hanover and I
 
08:52:42.350 --> 08:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear that Hanover's
 
08:52:44.788 --> 08:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
objection to this amendment is not a
 
08:52:47.750 --> 08:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
case of nimbyism or discrimination
 
08:52:50.910 --> 08:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
against college students in fact Hanover
 
08:52:54.070 --> 08:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
provides an excellent example of how a
 
08:52:57.030 --> 08:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
college town can take a leadership role
 
08:52:59.070 --> 08:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
towards creating more student housing
 
08:53:01.030 --> 08:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
stock and protecting college students in
 
08:53:03.708 --> 08:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
the rental market so over the last two
 
08:53:06.070 --> 08:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
years Hanover has addressed concerns
 
08:53:08.270 --> 08:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
over safety and housing code enforcement
 
08:53:11.670 --> 08:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
of private off-campus student housing
 
08:53:14.388 --> 08:53:14.398 align:start position:0%
Handover worked closely with the college
 
08:53:17.110 --> 08:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
the private sector students and
 
08:53:18.948 --> 08:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhoods to safely
 
08:53:20.788 --> 08:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
increase student housing while
 
08:53:22.910 --> 08:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
preserving landlord Investments and the
 
08:53:24.590 --> 08:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
nature of the surrounding neighborhood
 
08:53:28.510 --> 08:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
oods after extensive and expensive legal
 
08:53:30.830 --> 08:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
review the select board balanced
 
08:53:32.628 --> 08:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
competing interests before approving a
 
08:53:35.628 --> 08:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
compromised ballot proposal last year at
 
08:53:37.510 --> 08:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
town meeting the voters agreed to
 
08:53:39.750 --> 08:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
changes to our local ordinances that
 
08:53:42.910 --> 08:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
Define family to include a more Modern
 
08:53:45.270 --> 08:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
Family structure and off-campus student
 
08:53:47.670 --> 08:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
living arrangements the voters also
 
08:53:50.150 --> 08:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
approved a new residential housing high
 
08:53:53.228 --> 08:53:53.238 align:start position:0%
density Zone to increase privately owned
 
08:53:57.228 --> 08:53:57.238 align:start position:0%
student housing unit near campus but
 
08:53:59.788 --> 08:53:59.798 align:start position:0%
Hanover's proactive housing ordinance
 
08:54:02.070 --> 08:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
and Zoning changes will completely
 
08:54:03.990 --> 08:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
disappear if this amendment passes into
 
08:54:06.270 --> 08:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
law and Handover will be forced to
 
08:54:09.070 --> 08:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
undertake the process for a second time
 
08:54:11.708 --> 08:54:11.718 align:start position:0%
in as many years to resolve this crisis
 
08:54:14.110 --> 08:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker there are three glaring
 
08:54:17.110 --> 08:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
problems with this amendment first the
 
08:54:19.670 --> 08:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
amendment has significant drafting
 
08:54:22.990 --> 08:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
errors its language is vague and only
 
08:54:25.990 --> 08:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
States what is prohibited rather than
 
08:54:28.468 --> 08:54:28.478 align:start position:0%
what is affirmatively permitted this
 
08:54:30.868 --> 08:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
leads to differing interpretations and
 
08:54:33.030 --> 08:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
increases the risk of legal
 
08:54:35.548 --> 08:54:35.558 align:start position:0%
liability ultimately local taxpayers
 
08:54:38.350 --> 08:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
will bear the burden of increased costs
 
08:54:40.510 --> 08:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
when college towns are forced to use and
 
08:54:42.868 --> 08:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
then defend a poorly drafted law that
 
08:54:45.350 --> 08:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
was never fly um fully
 
08:54:48.350 --> 08:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
vetted second the amendment creates
 
08:54:51.388 --> 08:54:51.398 align:start position:0%
unnecessary zoning chaos the amendment
 
08:54:54.350 --> 08:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
invalidates Hanover's recently adopted
 
08:54:56.350 --> 08:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
and prior zoning ordinances without
 
08:54:58.670 --> 08:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
offering any solutions for replacement
 
08:55:00.868 --> 08:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
or how to move forward the bill is
 
08:55:03.308 --> 08:55:03.318 align:start position:0%
amended will take effect 60 days after
 
08:55:05.670 --> 08:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
passage which is not enough time to
 
08:55:08.388 --> 08:55:08.398 align:start position:0%
properly notice and redo our
 
08:55:11.308 --> 08:55:11.318 align:start position:0%
ordinances third this amendment will
 
08:55:14.910 --> 08:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
suppress interest among regular citizens
 
08:55:17.830 --> 08:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
to participate in local government if
 
08:55:19.350 --> 08:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
all the work that people put into
 
08:55:21.830 --> 08:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
changing ordinances and Zoning to combat
 
08:55:24.308 --> 08:55:24.318 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis can be easily
 
08:55:26.350 --> 08:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
overridden by a state law that did not
 
08:55:28.830 --> 08:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
involve the same level of collaboration
 
08:55:31.510 --> 08:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
than the average citizen May grow
 
08:55:34.990 --> 08:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
apathetic to the municipal engagement
 
08:55:36.628 --> 08:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
after all what's the point of spending
 
08:55:39.308 --> 08:55:39.318 align:start position:0%
two years volunteering your time on a
 
08:55:41.430 --> 08:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
weekly master plan committee if it can
 
08:55:44.070 --> 08:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
all be undone by the state legislature
 
08:55:46.708 --> 08:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this amendment will punish
 
08:55:49.430 --> 08:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
the very communities dedicated to
 
08:55:51.590 --> 08:55:51.600 align:start position:0%

08:56:15.270 --> 08:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
New London and kby Sawyer may not work
 
08:56:18.670 --> 08:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
for Durham and UNH this is not a one
 
08:56:21.788 --> 08:56:21.798 align:start position:0%
siiz all loow hanging fruit problem and
 
08:56:25.670 --> 08:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
there is no one siiz all solution
 
08:56:27.350 --> 08:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
to imagine that this amendment will cure
 
08:56:29.030 --> 08:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of its college town
 
08:56:31.468 --> 08:56:31.478 align:start position:0%
housing crisis is an
 
08:56:34.468 --> 08:56:34.478 align:start position:0%
oversimplification of a complex problem
 
08:56:36.948 --> 08:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
without any tangible evidence that this
 
08:56:39.590 --> 08:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
language is the appropriate solution
 
08:56:41.590 --> 08:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
therefore Mr Speaker I urge you to vote
 
08:56:44.030 --> 08:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
no on the amendment so that another more
 
08:56:46.350 --> 08:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
prudent motion may be made thank you Mr
 
08:56:49.788 --> 08:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
Speaker and I request a division
 
08:56:52.548 --> 08:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
vote representative Len turat recognize
 
08:57:01.628 --> 08:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:57:04.788 --> 08:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I also rise in
 
08:57:07.548 --> 08:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
opposition to Amendment
 
08:57:11.270 --> 08:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
1752 hb281 was originally heard in the
 
08:57:12.788 --> 08:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
municipal and County government
 
08:57:16.110 --> 08:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
committee which recommended itl by a
 
08:57:17.190 --> 08:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
vote of
 
08:57:21.228 --> 08:57:21.238 align:start position:0%
12-6 bipartisan vote in March this body
 
08:57:26.270 --> 08:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
here voted 307 to 7 1 to table this this
 
08:57:28.628 --> 08:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
bill or version of the amendment that's
 
08:57:28.638 --> 08:57:30.150 align:start position:0%
bill or version of the amendment that's
before

08:57:30.150 --> 08:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
before
 
08:57:33.548 --> 08:57:33.558 align:start position:0%
you this bill and the amendment was bad
 
08:57:35.030 --> 08:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
then and it's bad
 
08:57:37.510 --> 08:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
now the original bill was brought
 
08:57:40.468 --> 08:57:40.478 align:start position:0%
forward on behalf of two and I say again
 
08:57:40.478 --> 08:57:41.708 align:start position:0%
forward on behalf of two and I say again
two

08:57:41.708 --> 08:57:41.718 align:start position:0%
two
 
08:57:43.910 --> 08:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
landlords who have several rental
 
08:57:46.430 --> 08:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
properties in durm New Hampshire the
 
08:57:49.350 --> 08:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
Town Administrator of dur Todd selig who
 
08:57:51.510 --> 08:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
happens to have been in that p position
 
08:57:54.788 --> 08:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
for a couple decades now presented both
 
08:57:57.510 --> 08:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
a historical and detailed review of this
 
08:57:59.868 --> 08:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
issue along with the reasons why this is
 
08:58:01.228 --> 08:58:01.238 align:start position:0%
a horrible
 
08:58:04.070 --> 08:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
idea as much as I would love to read the
 
08:58:06.830 --> 08:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
entire five pages he wrote I'm going to
 
08:58:09.750 --> 08:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
just pick a few statements let's start
 
08:58:12.030 --> 08:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
with my favorite sentence from his
 
08:58:14.830 --> 08:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
testimony the suggested Amendment quote
 
08:58:18.070 --> 08:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
the suggested amendment to SP 527 and
 
08:58:22.030 --> 08:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
hb281 is poorly conceived is intended to
 
08:58:25.948 --> 08:58:25.958 align:start position:0%
support two aggrieved ger landlords and
 
08:58:28.750 --> 08:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
tries to address a problem that does not
 
08:58:31.548 --> 08:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
exist I want you to focus on that term
 
08:58:34.030 --> 08:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
two agreed landlords out of the hundreds
 
08:58:36.750 --> 08:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
of landlords that are in
 
08:58:39.468 --> 08:58:39.478 align:start position:0%
durm what about the other thousands of
 
08:58:42.388 --> 08:58:42.398 align:start position:0%
landlords and Municipal municipalities
 
08:58:45.350 --> 08:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
that this bill or Amendment will affect
 
08:58:48.308 --> 08:58:48.318 align:start position:0%
they testified in favor of this right no
 
08:58:51.270 --> 08:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
in Municipal and County government durm
 
08:58:54.868 --> 08:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
two AG reeved landlords they testify
 
08:58:57.350 --> 08:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
the two who just can't play by the rules
 
08:58:59.030 --> 08:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
like every other Durham
 
08:59:01.590 --> 08:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
landlord and they want you to override
 
08:59:03.948 --> 08:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
decades old
 
08:59:06.110 --> 08:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
ordinances throughout this extended
 
08:59:08.070 --> 08:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
process we received in Municipal and
 
08:59:10.628 --> 08:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
County government testimony from many
 
08:59:12.308 --> 08:59:12.318 align:start position:0%
municipalities and you'll note the
 
08:59:15.548 --> 08:59:15.558 align:start position:0%
common thread the durm toown planner Mr
 
08:59:17.750 --> 08:59:17.760 align:start position:0%

your entire life as I have that's almost
 
08:59:44.430 --> 08:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
63 years you will recall hearing about
 
08:59:46.548 --> 08:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
the many problems that existed in
 
08:59:49.468 --> 08:59:49.478 align:start position:0%
college towns particularly durm and
 
08:59:51.150 --> 08:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
these problems resulted in the
 
08:59:52.910 --> 08:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances that have now worked
 
08:59:55.150 --> 08:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly since since the mid
 
08:59:57.468 --> 08:59:57.478 align:start position:0%
80s well unless you're one of the two
 
08:59:59.548 --> 08:59:59.558 align:start position:0%
agreed Durham
 
09:00:01.510 --> 09:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
landlords there are a couple faulty
 
09:00:03.228 --> 09:00:03.238 align:start position:0%
claims I'd like to talk about very
 
09:00:05.628 --> 09:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
quickly here by those who are pushing
 
09:00:08.110 --> 09:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
this extremely bad Bill one is that
 
09:00:10.670 --> 09:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
college housing is in short supply
 
09:00:13.948 --> 09:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
that's wrong enrollment at UNH is down
 
09:00:17.110 --> 09:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
133% in just the last few years and
 
09:00:19.308 --> 09:00:19.318 align:start position:0%
further decline is forecast to continue
 
09:00:21.190 --> 09:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
at most brick and mortar
 
09:00:23.350 --> 09:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
universities during that time in the
 
09:00:27.070 --> 09:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
last uh few years durm has added 2400
 
09:00:30.228 --> 09:00:30.238 align:start position:0%
commercial housing units Apartments off
 
09:00:33.468 --> 09:00:33.478 align:start position:0%
C off campus but within
 
09:00:37.510 --> 09:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
durm 2400 so many units have been added
 
09:00:40.670 --> 09:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
into durm that a bus rout to New Market
 
09:00:42.590 --> 09:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
a town that previously accommodated
 
09:00:45.788 --> 09:00:45.798 align:start position:0%
large numbers of unh students ceased
 
09:00:49.110 --> 09:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
operation as there there was too few
 
09:00:51.708 --> 09:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
students um to use the bus routes
 
09:00:53.228 --> 09:00:53.238 align:start position:0%
because they had been accommodated into
 
09:00:53.238 --> 09:00:55.070 align:start position:0%
because they had been accommodated into
durm

09:00:55.070 --> 09:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
durm
 
09:00:56.750 --> 09:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing you'll you'll hear or
 
09:00:59.150 --> 09:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
have heard is that derms ordinances
 
09:01:02.190 --> 09:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
violate the Fair Housing Act again
 
09:01:05.110 --> 09:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
wrong quote from Mr selig's letter again
 
09:01:07.510 --> 09:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
durs three unrelated zoning provision is
 
09:01:09.910 --> 09:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
UN is constitutional is consistent with
 
09:01:13.388 --> 09:01:13.398 align:start position:0%
the fair federal fair housing a act and
 
09:01:17.548 --> 09:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
does not discriminate against students
 
09:01:20.030 --> 09:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
in fact durm was successful against a
 
09:01:22.308 --> 09:01:22.318 align:start position:0%
petitioner Who challenged exactly this
 
09:01:25.548 --> 09:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
point in 2010 in that case the presiding
 
09:01:27.228 --> 09:01:27.238 align:start position:0%
judge referred to a previous New
 
09:01:30.308 --> 09:01:30.318 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court saying as
 
09:01:33.628 --> 09:01:33.638 align:start position:0%
follows the petitioner claims that three
 
09:01:36.110 --> 09:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
unrelated rule is unconstitutional on
 
09:01:39.708 --> 09:01:39.718 align:start position:0%
its face and as applied which pres
 
09:01:42.628 --> 09:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
prohibits housing discrimination in New
 
09:01:44.830 --> 09:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the New Hampshire Supreme
 
09:01:47.030 --> 09:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
Court has addressed the is issue of
 
09:01:49.628 --> 09:01:49.638 align:start position:0%
whether 3 un related rule was
 
09:01:52.430 --> 09:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in durm versus white
 
09:01:54.350 --> 09:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
and the court noted that while state has
 
09:01:57.070 --> 09:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
an interest in keeping families together
 
09:02:00.228 --> 09:02:00.238 align:start position:0%
the same policy concerns do not apply
 
09:02:03.430 --> 09:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
when unrelated to uh when unrelated
 
09:02:06.070 --> 09:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
people wish to cohabitate the state has
 
09:02:07.990 --> 09:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
no particular interest in keeping
 
09:02:10.350 --> 09:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
together a certain group of unrelated
 
09:02:13.270 --> 09:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
persons hence this classification is not
 
09:02:18.948 --> 09:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
09:02:21.830 --> 09:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional one more quote from Mr
 
09:02:24.388 --> 09:02:24.398 align:start position:0%
selig the suggested Amendment
 
09:02:28.430 --> 09:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
s SP 527 and hb281 is poorly conceived
 
09:02:30.910 --> 09:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
is intended to support the two grieved
 
09:02:33.628 --> 09:02:33.638 align:start position:0%
landlords and tries to address a problem
 
09:02:34.868 --> 09:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
that does not
 
09:02:37.350 --> 09:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
exist it would transition current
 
09:02:40.070 --> 09:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and family residences
 
09:02:42.830 --> 09:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
in our community and potentially and
 
09:02:46.228 --> 09:02:46.238 align:start position:0%
others to 10,000 pered student housing
 
09:02:48.388 --> 09:02:48.398 align:start position:0%
and would do tremendous harm to the
 
09:02:50.590 --> 09:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
fabric of our traditional neighborhoods
 
09:02:52.350 --> 09:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
and the town as a
 
09:02:54.548 --> 09:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
whole I think we should actually change
 
09:02:56.150 --> 09:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
the name of this amendment and call it
 
09:02:58.548 --> 09:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
the quote let's fix a non-existent
 
09:03:00.830 --> 09:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
problem so two landlords can pack double
 
09:03:02.150 --> 09:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
the amount of students into their
 
09:03:03.830 --> 09:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
properties for double the
 
09:03:06.670 --> 09:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
income with the large potential density
 
09:03:08.708 --> 09:03:08.718 align:start position:0%

how to manage zoning uses for optimal
 
09:03:53.270 --> 09:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
results for all stakeholders shouldn't
 
09:03:55.228 --> 09:03:55.238 align:start position:0%
we refer to their knowledge and
 
09:03:57.150 --> 09:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
experience two words that you've heard
 
09:04:00.830 --> 09:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
out of my mouth many many times local
 
09:04:05.030 --> 09:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
control if it isn't broke don't fix it
 
09:04:08.468 --> 09:04:08.478 align:start position:0%
or in this case don't mess it up this is
 
09:04:11.430 --> 09:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
nothing but another state impose Central
 
09:04:14.308 --> 09:04:14.318 align:start position:0%
planning mandate we do not write bills
 
09:04:17.150 --> 09:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
for the financial benefit benefit of two
 
09:04:19.228 --> 09:04:19.238 align:start position:0%
individuals who can't get along with
 
09:04:21.628 --> 09:04:21.638 align:start position:0%
their host Community bills that will
 
09:04:23.990 --> 09:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
have huge negative impacts on thousand
 
09:04:25.670 --> 09:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the Town residents throughout the
 
09:04:28.510 --> 09:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
state I'd ask that you join in voting
 
09:04:32.350 --> 09:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
red against this amendment thank you Mr
 
09:04:34.750 --> 09:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative Powers recognized
 
09:04:45.948 --> 09:04:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
09:04:49.270 --> 09:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
09:04:52.910 --> 09:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
support of amendment 1752 H to Senate
 
09:04:56.948 --> 09:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
Bell 52 27 Mr Speaker this amendment is
 
09:04:59.990 --> 09:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
an important bipartisan measure based on
 
09:05:03.590 --> 09:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1281 which was strategically
 
09:05:06.190 --> 09:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
tabled to allow this improved
 
09:05:08.388 --> 09:05:08.398 align:start position:0%
legislation to be brought
 
09:05:11.228 --> 09:05:11.238 align:start position:0%
forward this amendment puts in place
 
09:05:14.150 --> 09:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
clear guard rails needed to protect
 
09:05:17.788 --> 09:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters from overreaching local
 
09:05:17.798 --> 09:05:18.868 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters from overreaching local
zoning

09:05:18.868 --> 09:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
09:05:21.628 --> 09:05:21.638 align:start position:0%
ordinances specifically it prohibits
 
09:05:24.150 --> 09:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
outof control municipalities
 
09:05:26.830 --> 09:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
from enacting zoning ordinances that are
 
09:05:29.228 --> 09:05:29.238 align:start position:0%
based on familial relationships or
 
09:05:32.270 --> 09:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
marital status this amendment also
 
09:05:34.910 --> 09:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
prohibits ordinances that restrict the
 
09:05:38.830 --> 09:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
number of occupants to less than two per
 
09:05:41.670 --> 09:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
bedroom unfortunately this legislation
 
09:05:43.628 --> 09:05:43.638 align:start position:0%
is needed because a number of
 
09:05:46.510 --> 09:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities across our state have
 
09:05:49.868 --> 09:05:49.878 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances that unnecessarily
 
09:05:53.110 --> 09:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
limit the number of unrelated people
 
09:05:56.990 --> 09:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to live together in fact some
 
09:05:59.990 --> 09:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities in particular those home
 
09:06:02.990 --> 09:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
to our colleges and universities have
 
09:06:05.190 --> 09:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
what is referred to as the three
 
09:06:09.068 --> 09:06:09.078 align:start position:0%
unrelated rule this particular local
 
09:06:12.670 --> 09:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
ordinance makes it illegal for more than
 
09:06:15.790 --> 09:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
three unrelated people to live together
 
09:06:18.830 --> 09:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of the size and number of
 
09:06:22.548 --> 09:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
bedrooms in the housing unit for example
 
09:06:24.708 --> 09:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
in some places in New Hampshire it is
 
09:06:27.868 --> 09:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
illegal for four unrelated people to
 
09:06:31.030 --> 09:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
live together in a four or even a five
 
09:06:34.350 --> 09:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
bedroom housing unit while a family of
 
09:06:37.790 --> 09:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
eight or more can legally live in the
 
09:06:41.470 --> 09:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
same unit make no mistake the three
 
09:06:45.548 --> 09:06:45.558 align:start position:0%
unrelated rule unjustly targets students
 
09:06:49.150 --> 09:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
essentially denying them Equal Housing
 
09:06:52.990 --> 09:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
considerations creating a scar scarcity
 
09:06:56.228 --> 09:06:56.238 align:start position:0%
of a available student housing Mr
 
09:06:58.630 --> 09:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
Speaker this is problematic for a number
 
09:07:02.228 --> 09:07:02.238 align:start position:0%
of reasons First Property Owners have a
 
09:07:04.748 --> 09:07:04.758 align:start position:0%
legal right to freely utilize their
 
09:07:07.748 --> 09:07:07.758 align:start position:0%
private property in a reasonable and
 
09:07:11.030 --> 09:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
responsible manner that does not pose
 
09:07:15.112 --> 09:07:15.122 align:start position:0%
any Genuine Health or safety concerns
 
09:07:17.908 --> 09:07:17.918 align:start position:0%
the three unrelated rule clearly
 
09:07:20.388 --> 09:07:20.398 align:start position:0%
infringes upon individuals property
 
09:07:24.068 --> 09:07:24.078 align:start position:0%
rights second to be clear if the basis
 
09:07:26.630 --> 09:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
for the three unrelated rule is about
 
09:07:29.588 --> 09:07:29.598 align:start position:0%
health and safety issues then towns like
 
09:07:32.790 --> 09:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
Durham should not grandfather some
 
09:07:35.068 --> 09:07:35.078 align:start position:0%
Residential Properties in certain
 
09:07:37.588 --> 09:07:37.598 align:start position:0%
neighbor neighborhoods from their three
 
09:07:40.350 --> 09:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
unrelated rule instead their three
 
09:07:42.950 --> 09:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
unrelated rule should apply equally to
 
09:07:45.990 --> 09:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
all Residential Properties within the
 
09:07:49.428 --> 09:07:49.438 align:start position:0%
town such zoning ordinances are unfair
 
09:07:52.030 --> 09:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
to both property owners and people
 
09:07:53.950 --> 09:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
seeking housing
 
09:07:57.630 --> 09:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
and finally unrel related individuals
 
09:08:01.150 --> 09:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
share housing for a variety of reasons
 
09:08:03.268 --> 09:08:03.278 align:start position:0%
students might share housing in order to
 
09:08:06.268 --> 09:08:06.278 align:start position:0%
be able to afford the cost of room and
 
09:08:09.950 --> 09:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
board and tuition working people might
 
09:08:12.428 --> 09:08:12.438 align:start position:0%
share housing to reduce expenses so they
 
09:08:15.428 --> 09:08:15.438 align:start position:0%
can pay off student and personal debts
 
09:08:17.950 --> 09:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
still others might find themselves in
 
09:08:20.310 --> 09:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
difficult circumstances such as
 
09:08:23.748 --> 09:08:23.758 align:start position:0%
individuals widowed divorced or retired
 
09:08:26.950 --> 09:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
people living on fixed or low incomes or
 
09:08:29.990 --> 09:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
even those experiencing the loss of
 
09:08:32.670 --> 09:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
employment as well as the as well as
 
09:08:36.510 --> 09:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
elderly and disabled persons also
 
09:08:39.228 --> 09:08:39.238 align:start position:0%
realize that some unrelated people may
 
09:08:42.908 --> 09:08:42.918 align:start position:0%
even need to share housing in order to
 
09:08:42.918 --> 09:08:44.150 align:start position:0%
even need to share housing in order to
avoid

09:08:44.150 --> 09:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
09:08:46.790 --> 09:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness zoning ordinances like the
 
09:08:50.428 --> 09:08:50.438 align:start position:0%
three unrelated rule artificially limit
 
09:08:53.748 --> 09:08:53.758 align:start position:0%
the housing Supply and drive up cost for
 
09:08:57.350 --> 09:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
people seeking housing to conclude this
 
09:08:59.830 --> 09:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
amendment not only complement Senate
 
09:09:03.708 --> 09:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
Bill 527 study committee for potential
 
09:09:06.868 --> 09:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
solutions to Affordable student housing
 
09:09:10.510 --> 09:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
but importantly it provides a sure and
 
09:09:13.790 --> 09:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
immediate measure towards alleviating
 
09:09:16.388 --> 09:09:16.398 align:start position:0%
what is a serious issue for students and
 
09:09:19.388 --> 09:09:19.398 align:start position:0%
others seeking housing in our state and
 
09:09:22.830 --> 09:09:22.840 align:start position:0%

09:09:27.112 --> 09:09:27.122 align:start position:0%
this amendment and they did so via a
 
09:09:29.908 --> 09:09:29.918 align:start position:0%
resolution for these reasons I urge my
 
09:09:32.228 --> 09:09:32.238 align:start position:0%

09:09:34.830 --> 09:09:34.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
09:12:03.510 --> 09:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment provides a powerful
 
09:12:05.868 --> 09:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
incentive for investors to buy single
 
09:12:07.990 --> 09:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
family homes and college communities
 
09:12:09.748 --> 09:12:09.758 align:start position:0%
driving up prices and making it a
 
09:12:11.350 --> 09:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
challenge for families to buy those
 
09:12:13.830 --> 09:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
units and if I know this bill does
 
09:12:15.708 --> 09:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
nothing to help build one and two
 
09:12:18.150 --> 09:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
bedroom units at below Market rental
 
09:12:21.068 --> 09:12:21.078 align:start position:0%
rates that graduate students desperately
 
09:12:24.470 --> 09:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
need and if I know that d it bonuses
 
09:12:26.748 --> 09:12:26.758 align:start position:0%
that help developers build those units
 
09:12:29.990 --> 09:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
are far more effective than occupancy
 
09:12:32.470 --> 09:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
minimum limits then would I press the
 
09:12:35.950 --> 09:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
red button to defeat this harmful
 
09:12:37.790 --> 09:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Damons
 
09:12:43.588 --> 09:12:43.598 align:start position:0%
 
09:12:45.748 --> 09:12:45.758 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker good
 
09:12:47.950 --> 09:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
evening colleagues I think it's
 
09:12:52.190 --> 09:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
evening if I know Amendment 1752 does
 
09:12:55.708 --> 09:12:55.718 align:start position:0%
just two reasonable things it prohibits
 
09:12:57.510 --> 09:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities from restricting
 
09:13:01.068 --> 09:13:01.078 align:start position:0%
occupancy of new single family duplex or
 
09:13:03.190 --> 09:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
multif family dwelling units based on
 
09:13:06.990 --> 09:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
familial relationships or marital status
 
09:13:09.588 --> 09:13:09.598 align:start position:0%
and it prohibits respecting the
 
09:13:12.350 --> 09:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
occupants of a single bedroom to only
 
09:13:12.360 --> 09:13:13.268 align:start position:0%
occupants of a single bedroom to only
one

09:13:13.268 --> 09:13:13.278 align:start position:0%
one
 
09:13:15.630 --> 09:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
person if I also know that
 
09:13:18.112 --> 09:13:18.122 align:start position:0%
municipalities would still be fully able
 
09:13:20.630 --> 09:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
to enforce State Building and fire codes
 
09:13:23.588 --> 09:13:23.598 align:start position:0%
and respect public health and safety
 
09:13:25.588 --> 09:13:25.598 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button to
 
09:13:27.588 --> 09:13:27.598 align:start position:0%
support this pragmatic effort to
 
09:13:29.470 --> 09:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
increase housing that is desperately
 
09:13:33.112 --> 09:13:33.122 align:start position:0%
 
09:13:36.112 --> 09:13:36.122 align:start position:0%
you before we call that members are
 
09:13:38.068 --> 09:13:38.078 align:start position:0%
reminded that when someone is speaking
 
09:13:42.588 --> 09:13:42.598 align:start position:0%
at the well do not walk in front of them
 
09:13:44.790 --> 09:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
really the question is on the adoption

immigrants having considered the same
 
09:17:35.068 --> 09:17:35.078 align:start position:0%
report the same with the following
 
09:17:37.310 --> 09:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
resolution resolved that is inexpedient
 
09:17:42.350 --> 09:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
09:17:44.588 --> 09:17:44.598 align:start position:0%
committee minority of the committee
 
09:17:46.150 --> 09:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
having considered the same being unable
 
09:17:47.748 --> 09:17:47.758 align:start position:0%
to agree with the majority report the
 
09:17:49.190 --> 09:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
09:17:51.428 --> 09:17:51.438 align:start position:0%
pass sen Matthew Coker for the minority
 
09:17:55.830 --> 09:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
09:18:07.790 --> 09:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
09:18:11.950 --> 09:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
Koker thank you Mr Speaker so I Rise uh
 
09:18:14.708 --> 09:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
to uh oppose the itl motion on Senate
 
09:18:14.718 --> 09:18:16.112 align:start position:0%
to uh oppose the itl motion on Senate
Bill

09:18:16.112 --> 09:18:16.122 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
09:18:20.388 --> 09:18:20.398 align:start position:0%
358 um the main reason for this is our
 
09:18:22.908 --> 09:18:22.918 align:start position:0%
country is built on the fundamental
 
09:18:26.790 --> 09:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
principle of the ru of law no individual
 
09:18:30.790 --> 09:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
stands above it this principle should be
 
09:18:32.708 --> 09:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
at the foundation of the debate about
 
09:18:35.112 --> 09:18:35.122 align:start position:0%
this bill so basically what this bill
 
09:18:37.950 --> 09:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
does is it invalidates driver's licenses
 
09:18:41.310 --> 09:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
issued to undocumented immigrants by
 
09:18:43.548 --> 09:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
other states
 
09:18:46.228 --> 09:18:46.238 align:start position:0%
um so basically if they cannot prove
 
09:18:48.630 --> 09:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
their lawful presence that's what it
 
09:18:51.548 --> 09:18:51.558 align:start position:0%
does and a few a few States actually
 
09:18:52.868 --> 09:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
Market on the driver's license since
 
09:18:54.350 --> 09:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
that makes it a little bit easier to see
 
09:18:59.670 --> 09:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
09:19:03.388 --> 09:19:03.398 align:start position:0%
so sorry I lost my place here all right
 
09:19:06.588 --> 09:19:06.598 align:start position:0%
so if you cannot prove your lawful
 
09:19:09.268 --> 09:19:09.278 align:start position:0%
presence within our country the question
 
09:19:14.550 --> 09:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
has to be asked will you is it right for
 
09:19:18.230 --> 09:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
us to extend a government privilege to a
 
09:19:21.190 --> 09:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
person who decides that they do not want
 
09:19:23.230 --> 09:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
to follow the proper immigration
 
09:19:25.950 --> 09:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
process is that the right thing to do
 
09:19:27.630 --> 09:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
it's a tough subject and there's passion
 
09:19:30.110 --> 09:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
on both sides and I think that's why we
 
09:19:32.830 --> 09:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
really need to take a look at this from
 
09:19:35.670 --> 09:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
a rational uh perspective I value
 
09:19:37.266 --> 09:19:37.276 align:start position:0%
immigration and it's one of the reasons
 
09:19:39.310 --> 09:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
why our country prospers however there's
 
09:19:41.830 --> 09:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
no doubt that our current state of
 
09:19:45.030 --> 09:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
immigration is in chaos if you go 70
 
09:19:47.586 --> 09:19:47.596 align:start position:0%
miles south of here and go to Boston
 
09:19:51.070 --> 09:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
Logan Airport you have legal immigrants
 
09:19:53.150 --> 09:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
and I mean legal immigrants
 
09:19:57.266 --> 09:19:57.276 align:start position:0%
in the terminal in Boston Logan so what
 
09:19:58.870 --> 09:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
does this have to do with invalidating
 
09:20:00.990 --> 09:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license it has everything to do
 
09:20:04.350 --> 09:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
with it because having illegal
 
09:20:06.746 --> 09:20:06.756 align:start position:0%
immigration kind of encouraged by giving
 
09:20:09.390 --> 09:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
people government IDs throws fuel onto
 
09:20:12.790 --> 09:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
this fire it causes more problems and if
 
09:20:17.190 --> 09:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
we value our legal immigration system
 
09:20:18.510 --> 09:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
and we
 
09:20:21.746 --> 09:20:21.756 align:start position:0%
value people following the law we
 
09:20:24.746 --> 09:20:24.756 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be encouraging ille illegal
 
09:20:27.550 --> 09:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
immigration in any
 
09:20:30.030 --> 09:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
way so there's a couple misconceptions
 
09:20:31.950 --> 09:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
about this bill first is is that there's
 
09:20:33.906 --> 09:20:33.916 align:start position:0%
going to be profiling there's no way to
 
09:20:35.906 --> 09:20:35.916 align:start position:0%
profile this bill has nothing to do with
 
09:20:37.906 --> 09:20:37.916 align:start position:0%
profiling basically if the license has
 
09:20:40.426 --> 09:20:40.436 align:start position:0%
that Mark on it then that's how a police
 
09:20:43.150 --> 09:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
officer would know and basically they
 
09:20:44.426 --> 09:20:44.436 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to drive in the
 
09:20:49.830 --> 09:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
state um as far as uh the reciprocity
 
09:20:54.070 --> 09:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
with other states so if you're issued a
 
09:20:55.990 --> 09:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license from the state of
 
09:20:57.746 --> 09:20:57.756 align:start position:0%
Florida and you're a 15-year-old on a
 
09:20:59.830 --> 09:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
learner's permit we don't accept that in
 
09:21:02.510 --> 09:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so you know we do accept
 
09:21:04.510 --> 09:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
other license other licenses from other
 
09:21:06.990 --> 09:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
states but that doesn't it's not
 
09:21:08.550 --> 09:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
absolute we can still have a little bit
 
09:21:12.110 --> 09:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
of control of that um and really what
 
09:21:16.870 --> 09:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
this boils down to is again we have a
 
09:21:19.710 --> 09:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
crisis it's I I travel all over the
 
09:21:22.790 --> 09:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
country I've watched it move north and
 
09:21:25.906 --> 09:21:25.916 align:start position:0%
it's a legal immigration crisis doing
 
09:21:28.390 --> 09:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
anything to encourage or send mixed
 
09:21:31.470 --> 09:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
signals that illegal immigration is okay
 
09:21:34.710 --> 09:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
is completely unacceptable and our
 
09:21:36.150 --> 09:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
neighbors might be able to do it but
 
09:21:37.390 --> 09:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I think we should
 
09:21:39.790 --> 09:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
send a strong message that we want
 
09:21:41.990 --> 09:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
people to go through the legal
 
09:21:44.550 --> 09:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
immigration process and not take a
 
09:21:47.350 --> 09:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
shortcut and to think about how unfair
 
09:21:49.070 --> 09:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
that is to the people who are actually
 
09:21:52.630 --> 09:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing so I ask you to uh
 
09:21:54.310 --> 09:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
vote down this itl motion so that we can
 
09:21:56.426 --> 09:21:56.436 align:start position:0%
make another motion thank you does a
 
09:21:57.586 --> 09:21:57.596 align:start position:0%
member yield to
 
09:22:01.426 --> 09:22:01.436 align:start position:0%
questions no member does not yield CH
 
09:22:09.150 --> 09:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:22:12.586 --> 09:22:12.596 align:start position:0%
a thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker s SP
 
09:22:14.950 --> 09:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
350 358 would invalidate the driver's
 
09:22:17.030 --> 09:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
licenses of undocumented immigrants
 
09:22:19.710 --> 09:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
lawfully issued by other states I
 
09:22:20.830 --> 09:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
believe this bill is fundamentally
 
09:22:22.510 --> 09:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
flawed and poses significant problems
 
09:22:25.790 --> 09:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
for our state our economy and our
 
09:22:28.870 --> 09:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
values first this bill is very this bill
 
09:22:30.470 --> 09:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
very likely violates the full faith in
 
09:22:32.190 --> 09:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
confidence Clause Full Faith and Credit
 
09:22:33.790 --> 09:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
Clause of the United States Constitution
 
09:22:36.550 --> 09:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
which requires that states recognize the
 
09:22:38.350 --> 09:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
public acts records and judicial
 
09:22:41.070 --> 09:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
procceedings of every other state by
 
09:22:43.150 --> 09:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
invalidating driver's licenses issued by
 
09:22:45.390 --> 09:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
States like California and Colorado to
 
09:22:47.710 --> 09:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
undocumented IM immigrants we are
 
09:22:49.350 --> 09:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
setting a dangerous precedent that could
 
09:22:51.670 --> 09:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
invite legal challenges and unnecessary
 
09:22:51.680 --> 09:22:52.990 align:start position:0%
invite legal challenges and unnecessary
litigation

09:22:52.990 --> 09:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
09:22:54.990 --> 09:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
our state resources could be better
 
09:22:57.586 --> 09:22:57.596 align:start position:0%
spent elsewhere than defending a law
 
09:23:00.426 --> 09:23:00.436 align:start position:0%
that undermines the spirit of Interstate
 
09:23:02.670 --> 09:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
cooperation second this bill creates
 
09:23:04.390 --> 09:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
confusion and uncertainty not only for
 
09:23:07.350 --> 09:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
visitors but also for law enforcement it
 
09:23:09.230 --> 09:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
encourages racial profiling and creates
 
09:23:11.990 --> 09:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
a potential roadside nightmare imagine a
 
09:23:13.426 --> 09:23:13.436 align:start position:0%
scenario where an out ofate visitor
 
09:23:14.830 --> 09:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
legally driving with a license from
 
09:23:16.746 --> 09:23:16.756 align:start position:0%
their home state is suddenly considered
 
09:23:19.070 --> 09:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
a criminal not because they've committed
 
09:23:21.426 --> 09:23:21.436 align:start position:0%
a criminal act but simply because
 
09:23:23.746 --> 09:23:23.756 align:start position:0%
they're duly issued driver's license is
 
09:23:26.670 --> 09:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
not recognized here this will place an
 
09:23:29.550 --> 09:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
undue burden on our police officers who
 
09:23:31.310 --> 09:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
will need to enforce these arbitrary and
 
09:23:33.746 --> 09:23:33.756 align:start position:0%
discriminatory discriminatory rules
 
09:23:36.310 --> 09:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
diverting their attention from more

ofate driers licenses we undermine the

this bill cannot be ignored our tourism

Hampshire's economy relies on visitors

from across the country by passing this
 
09:24:27.906 --> 09:24:27.916 align:start position:0%
bill we' risk turning off and pushing
 
09:24:29.586 --> 09:24:29.596 align:start position:0%
away a significant portion of those
 
09:24:31.586 --> 09:24:31.596 align:start position:0%
tourists who may decide to take their

business elsewhere rather than navigate
 
09:24:36.310 --> 09:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
a confusing and hosle legal landscape in
 
09:24:38.190 --> 09:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
conclusion while I understand the
 
09:24:40.710 --> 09:24:40.720 align:start position:0%

state sovereignty this bill is not the
 
09:24:47.990 --> 09:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
solution it is constitutionally
 
09:24:50.150 --> 09:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
questionable economically harmful and
 
09:24:52.870 --> 09:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
morally wrong it places an new burden on
 
09:24:54.630 --> 09:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement our economy and our
 
09:24:57.030 --> 09:24:57.040 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
09:26:32.030 --> 09:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that the position of the house
 
09:26:33.990 --> 09:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
is that non-resident aliens will not get
 
09:26:36.426 --> 09:26:36.436 align:start position:0%
a driver's license granted until their
 
09:26:38.670 --> 09:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
claims are complete and their permanent
 
09:26:41.390 --> 09:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
residency is granted if I believe the
 
09:26:43.230 --> 09:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
non-resident aliens from other states
 
09:26:45.630 --> 09:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
with the same status should be held to
 
09:26:47.710 --> 09:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
the same standard if they're in New
 
09:26:50.230 --> 09:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
09:26:51.746 --> 09:26:51.756 align:start position:0%
know that even under the licensed
 
09:26:53.586 --> 09:26:53.596 align:start position:0%
compact we are allowed to make changes
 
09:26:56.190 --> 09:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
to our specific laws then wouldn't I
 
09:26:58.426 --> 09:26:58.436 align:start position:0%
press the red

09:27:08.470 --> 09:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
09:27:12.070 --> 09:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
if I know that sb3 358 would invalidate
 
09:27:13.950 --> 09:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses lawfully issued by
 
09:27:15.390 --> 09:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
other states when driving in New
 
09:27:17.710 --> 09:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if I know we want people
 
09:27:20.110 --> 09:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
driving on our roads to have proven
 
09:27:23.190 --> 09:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
their ability to do so safely
 
09:27:25.426 --> 09:27:25.436 align:start position:0%
and if I further know asking local law
 
09:27:27.426 --> 09:27:27.436 align:start position:0%
enforcement to ascertain on the side of
 
09:27:29.790 --> 09:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
the road during a routine traffic stop
 
09:27:31.990 --> 09:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
whether a draw driver is lawfully
 
09:27:33.746 --> 09:27:33.756 align:start position:0%
present in the United States based on
 
09:27:35.550 --> 09:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
the policy of the state that issued the
 
09:27:37.746 --> 09:27:37.756 align:start position:0%
driver's license is far beyond
 
09:27:40.310 --> 09:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable or feasible to ask of our
 
09:27:42.350 --> 09:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
officers and if I know that the New
 
09:27:43.790 --> 09:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Safety has
 
09:27:46.950 --> 09:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
estimated at least $200,000 in costs in
 
09:27:48.870 --> 09:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
the next 3 years to research and
 
09:27:51.670 --> 09:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
maintain an ongoing and updated database
 
09:27:53.670 --> 09:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
of in valid license
 
09:27:56.510 --> 09:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
classes and finally if I know I do not
 
09:27:58.350 --> 09:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
want other states to decide in turn that
 
09:28:00.110 --> 09:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
they can void our New Hampshire drivers
 
09:28:02.230 --> 09:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
licenses when we cross a state line and
 
09:28:04.630 --> 09:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
subject us to criminal charges would I
 
09:28:06.390 --> 09:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
now push the green button so this bill

having considered the same being unable

to agree with the majority Report with
 
09:35:08.230 --> 09:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
the following resolution resolved that
 
09:35:09.710 --> 09:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
is inexpedient to legislate
 
09:35:11.070 --> 09:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ted Gorski for the
 
09:35:12.830 --> 09:35:12.840 align:start position:0%

Gorski thank you Mr Speaker

report of OTP of
 
09:35:31.990 --> 09:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
sb501 and Mr Speaker I'm a baseball fan
 
09:35:34.150 --> 09:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
like many in you in this room may
 
09:35:36.710 --> 09:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
be and every once in a while when you
 
09:35:38.470 --> 09:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
watch baseball there is an
 
09:35:42.106 --> 09:35:42.116 align:start position:0%
oddity in which a batter will get up and
 
09:35:46.426 --> 09:35:46.436 align:start position:0%
see three strikes go past them without
 
09:35:48.830 --> 09:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
swinging and when that happens you hear
 
09:35:52.070 --> 09:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
the announcers say there it goes good
 
09:35:55.790 --> 09:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
morning good afternoon and good
 
09:35:58.790 --> 09:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
night well I'm going to show you how
 
09:36:02.510 --> 09:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
this bill strikes out in three
 
09:36:06.670 --> 09:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
pitches first pitch in testimony we were
 
09:36:09.426 --> 09:36:09.436 align:start position:0%
told that this bill would only deal with
 
09:36:12.630 --> 09:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
lawfully present
 
09:36:15.710 --> 09:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
noncitizens now we never got a
 
09:36:18.710 --> 09:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
definition of what lawfully present
 
09:36:21.586 --> 09:36:21.596 align:start position:0%
means according to the feds right now A
 
09:36:24.310 --> 09:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
lawfully present means stepping on US
 
09:36:27.630 --> 09:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
territory in your given lawful
 
09:36:31.426 --> 09:36:31.436 align:start position:0%
presence with little or no
 
09:36:36.190 --> 09:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
09:36:38.350 --> 09:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
morning second
 
09:36:42.230 --> 09:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
Pitch the bill states that the director
 
09:36:45.070 --> 09:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
the DMV May issue a license to a spouse
 
09:36:47.586 --> 09:36:47.596 align:start position:0%
or a child of an alien
 
09:36:51.746 --> 09:36:51.756 align:start position:0%
licensed with little or no vetting
 
09:36:53.390 --> 09:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
so now I ask
 
09:36:56.390 --> 09:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
you what could go wrong
 
09:37:00.586 --> 09:37:00.596 align:start position:0%
here good afternoon strike
 
09:37:04.710 --> 09:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
two third pitch the bill
 
09:37:07.906 --> 09:37:07.916 align:start position:0%
States quote once licensed the
 
09:37:10.470 --> 09:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
individual shall be subject to the same
 
09:37:14.510 --> 09:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
provisions of the law as other
 
09:37:17.906 --> 09:37:17.916 align:start position:0%
lenses during testimony a question was
 
09:37:20.230 --> 09:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
asked of the DMV supervisor what that
 
09:37:22.106 --> 09:37:22.116 align:start position:0%
sentence meant
 
09:37:26.630 --> 09:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
her response quote I don't
 
09:37:28.670 --> 09:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
know while we all know what that
 
09:37:32.510 --> 09:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
sentence means this opens the door for
 
09:37:36.550 --> 09:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
09:37:40.390 --> 09:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
Integrity good night strike
 
09:37:43.950 --> 09:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
three with that I ask you to support the
 
09:37:46.790 --> 09:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
motion of itl by pressing the red button
 
09:37:49.790 --> 09:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
in putting this bill back on the bench
 
09:37:51.510 --> 09:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I ask for
 
09:37:51.520 --> 09:37:53.990 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I ask for
division

09:37:53.990 --> 09:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
09:38:03.586 --> 09:38:03.596 align:start position:0%
 
09:38:07.030 --> 09:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
syes thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
09:38:10.790 --> 09:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues um contrary to what you might
 
09:38:13.230 --> 09:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
just have heard the sky is not falling
 
09:38:18.190 --> 09:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill okay there are over
 
09:38:22.150 --> 09:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
currently 55,000 nonresident
 
09:38:25.586 --> 09:38:25.596 align:start position:0%
licensed to drive in New Hampshire this
 
09:38:29.670 --> 09:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
bill began its life in the other body as
 
09:38:33.510 --> 09:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
a housekeeping measure to bring into to
 
09:38:35.906 --> 09:38:35.916 align:start position:0%
codify some of the practices that
 
09:38:38.106 --> 09:38:38.116 align:start position:0%
they've been doing for years and years
 
09:38:40.950 --> 09:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
and years and it's interesting to me
 
09:38:43.426 --> 09:38:43.436 align:start position:0%
that in spite of all of this the sky is
 
09:38:46.550 --> 09:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
falling stuff there's been no
 
09:38:48.950 --> 09:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
documented cases that were brought to
 
09:38:51.390 --> 09:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
our attention where people who are
 
09:38:53.550 --> 09:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
licensed under these types of Provisions
 
09:38:55.390 --> 09:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
have become a
 
09:39:00.030 --> 09:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
problem on top of that one of the major
 
09:39:02.510 --> 09:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that we face as a state we all
 
09:39:04.830 --> 09:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
know we all recognize that housing is a
 
09:39:07.950 --> 09:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
serious problem we also we also all
 
09:39:12.030 --> 09:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
recognize that child care is a problem
 
09:39:13.990 --> 09:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing we recognize is because
 
09:39:17.390 --> 09:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
of those two problems we also have a
 
09:39:20.106 --> 09:39:20.116 align:start position:0%
problem with employees having enough
 
09:39:22.350 --> 09:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
people to come and do the jobs that need
 
09:39:26.710 --> 09:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
to be done why would we turn our backs
 
09:39:29.630 --> 09:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
on having people who can come here and
 
09:39:32.870 --> 09:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
drive legally they're here legally in
 
09:39:35.630 --> 09:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
the United States lawful presence is
 
09:39:39.266 --> 09:39:39.276 align:start position:0%
defined in the law um and they have they
 
09:39:42.670 --> 09:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
will achieve their driving privileges by
 
09:39:44.426 --> 09:39:44.436 align:start position:0%
passing a
 
09:39:48.630 --> 09:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
driver's written exam and a a practical
 
09:39:53.150 --> 09:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:39:55.870 --> 09:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
if these people are here legally and if
 
09:39:58.710 --> 09:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
they meet all the requirements for
 
09:40:01.746 --> 09:40:01.756 align:start position:0%
driving in New Hampshire why wouldn't we
 
09:40:03.790 --> 09:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
then continue that
 
09:40:09.106 --> 09:40:09.116 align:start position:0%
practice um I would urge colleagues to
 
09:40:11.230 --> 09:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is just a
 
09:40:13.710 --> 09:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill really at its most
 
09:40:17.350 --> 09:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
basic it's just a housekeeping bill that
 
09:40:20.310 --> 09:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
mirrors and brings into codification
 
09:40:23.586 --> 09:40:23.596 align:start position:0%
current language and practices that have
 
09:40:25.746 --> 09:40:25.756 align:start position:0%
successfully brought driver's licenses
 
09:40:28.630 --> 09:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
to many of the people who live in this
 
09:40:34.150 --> 09:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:40:36.586 --> 09:40:36.596 align:start position:0%

09:48:30.670 --> 09:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that
 
09:48:32.950 --> 09:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
telling the truth matters especially in
 
09:48:35.190 --> 09:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
situations would in which could impact
 
09:48:37.550 --> 09:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
the life well-being and future of a
 
09:48:40.790 --> 09:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
child or their caregiver if I also know
 
09:48:42.790 --> 09:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
that I have a constituent whose
 
09:48:45.710 --> 09:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
ex-spouse has levied four false claims
 
09:48:48.510 --> 09:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
of abuse against him it's her ex-husband
 
09:48:51.070 --> 09:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
and each time they were found unfounded
 
09:48:54.070 --> 09:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
and false and it has been debilitating
 
09:48:56.390 --> 09:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
not only for the father but with the
 
09:48:58.510 --> 09:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
joint custody he has with his four
 
09:49:00.746 --> 09:49:00.756 align:start position:0%
children and if I further know that
 
09:49:03.870 --> 09:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
these cases are all too common and Mr
 
09:49:05.906 --> 09:49:05.916 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this amendment has
 
09:49:09.426 --> 09:49:09.436 align:start position:0%
passed the house not once but twice and
 
09:49:11.990 --> 09:49:12.000 align:start position:0%

09:49:15.710 --> 09:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
deter false allegations not truthful
 
09:49:18.830 --> 09:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
allegations and lastly Mr Speaker if I
 
09:49:20.950 --> 09:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
know the passage of this amendment can
 
09:49:22.950 --> 09:49:22.960 align:start position:0%

09:49:26.426 --> 09:49:26.436 align:start position:0%

09:55:06.310 --> 09:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
09:55:08.670 --> 09:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
changes and finally if I know that this
 
09:55:11.230 --> 09:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
council's real purpose is to siphon up
 
09:55:14.510 --> 09:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
federal and Foundation grants and that
 
09:55:17.266 --> 09:55:17.276 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill said quote
 
09:55:19.350 --> 09:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
I just want them to be able to get grant
 
09:55:21.106 --> 09:55:21.116 align:start position:0%
money unquote
 
09:55:23.230 --> 09:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
what I now press the green button to lay
 
09:55:25.390 --> 09:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
this bill on the table to make sure that
 
09:55:27.870 --> 09:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
government doesn't get in the way of
 
09:55:30.310 --> 09:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
real environmental
 
09:55:32.746 --> 09:55:32.756 align:start position:0%
Innovation thank you Mr Speaker chair
 
09:55:34.350 --> 09:55:34.360 align:start position:0%

parliamentary
 
09:55:38.070 --> 09:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry okay thank you Mr chairman
 
09:55:40.150 --> 09:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
members of the house I rise in
 
09:55:42.990 --> 09:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to the tabling motion I know
 
09:55:44.830 --> 09:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
the hour is late and we probably all
 
09:55:49.070 --> 09:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
want to go home Pi I'm sorry and I would
 
09:55:51.030 --> 09:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh at pi and I would like to have a
 
09:55:53.190 --> 09:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
brief debate on this bill which passed
 
09:55:56.426 --> 09:55:56.436 align:start position:0%
the other body by an unanimous vote and
 
09:55:58.790 --> 09:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
passed our committee by an overwhelming
 
09:56:00.790 --> 09:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan vote and I think it's such an
 
09:56:04.266 --> 09:56:04.276 align:start position:0%
 
09:56:07.190 --> 09:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
you the motion before us is to lay on
 
09:56:10.030 --> 09:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
the table Senate Bill 543 this is a
 
09:56:12.106 --> 09:56:12.116 align:start position:0%
division vote if you're in favor you'll
 
09:56:13.630 --> 09:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
press the green button if you oppose you
 
09:56:15.310 --> 09:56:15.320 align:start position:0%

09:56:53.070 --> 09:56:53.080 align:start position:0%

fails now we're back to
 
09:57:13.830 --> 09:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
the the original motion of a pass chair
 
09:57:16.630 --> 09:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
09:57:22.746 --> 09:57:22.756 align:start position:0%
 
09:57:26.070 --> 09:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
09:57:29.426 --> 09:57:29.436 align:start position:0%
Speaker so this bill has a very vague
 
09:57:29.436 --> 09:57:31.350 align:start position:0%
Speaker so this bill has a very vague
purpose

09:57:31.350 --> 09:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
09:57:34.070 --> 09:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
statement as I mentioned in the pi I did
 
09:57:37.710 --> 09:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago it states that the
 
09:57:40.790 --> 09:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
09:57:43.990 --> 09:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill focuses on future projects of
 
09:57:46.586 --> 09:57:46.596 align:start position:0%
projections excuse me of environmental
 
09:57:48.906 --> 09:57:48.916 align:start position:0%
changes in New
 
09:57:51.150 --> 09:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by but human beings have
 
09:57:54.106 --> 09:57:54.116 align:start position:0%
proved to be very poor at predicting the
 
09:57:55.670 --> 09:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
future especially when it comes to
 
09:57:58.310 --> 09:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
environmental changes over the last 50
 
09:58:02.510 --> 09:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
years about 49 significant environmental
 
09:58:05.266 --> 09:58:05.276 align:start position:0%
predictions have been made and all 49
 
09:58:06.746 --> 09:58:06.756 align:start position:0%
have failed to come
 
09:58:11.310 --> 09:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
true if you flip the coin 49 times the
 
09:58:14.550 --> 09:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
chances of it coming up the same 49
 
09:58:21.710 --> 09:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
09:58:24.510 --> 09:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
what that tells us is that those proje
 
09:58:28.906 --> 09:58:28.916 align:start position:0%
predictions of the future are based
 
09:58:28.916 --> 09:58:32.030 align:start position:0%
predictions of the future are based
on

09:58:32.030 --> 09:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
09:58:36.710 --> 09:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
untruths what this bill seeks to do is
 
09:58:39.106 --> 09:58:39.116 align:start position:0%
make the most resilient and adaptive
 
09:58:42.426 --> 09:58:42.436 align:start position:0%
species on the planet
 
09:58:45.426 --> 09:58:45.436 align:start position:0%
humans more resilient and
 
09:58:47.310 --> 09:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
adaptive I don't know how the bill is
 
09:58:50.830 --> 09:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish that
 
09:58:53.790 --> 09:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
this bill creates a council that has 17
 
09:58:53.800 --> 09:58:55.746 align:start position:0%
this bill creates a council that has 17
members

09:58:55.746 --> 09:58:55.756 align:start position:0%
members
 
09:58:59.390 --> 09:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
17 now prior experience has shown us
 
09:59:01.950 --> 09:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
that organizations that have this many
 
09:59:04.746 --> 09:59:04.756 align:start position:0%
members are completely
 
09:59:07.470 --> 09:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional it's hard to get a group
 
09:59:12.870 --> 09:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
09:59:15.106 --> 09:59:15.116 align:start position:0%
them I'm not saying that to be funny
 
09:59:17.350 --> 09:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
house will be in order I'm not saying
 
09:59:19.310 --> 09:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
that to be funny take the example of the
 
09:59:22.710 --> 09:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
site evalu valuation committee we just
 
09:59:24.746 --> 09:59:24.756 align:start position:0%
significantly reformed the site
 
09:59:26.870 --> 09:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee by reducing its
 
09:59:29.870 --> 09:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
membership from nine people down to five
 
09:59:33.070 --> 09:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
people for the very reason that it was
 
09:59:35.510 --> 09:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to get that group
 
09:59:38.586 --> 09:59:38.596 align:start position:0%
together to get any significant work
 
09:59:41.630 --> 09:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
done so what are the 17 people in on
 
09:59:45.106 --> 09:59:45.116 align:start position:0%
 
09:59:47.790 --> 09:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish there's also a significant
 
09:59:47.800 --> 09:59:50.230 align:start position:0%
accomplish there's also a significant
disconnect

09:59:50.230 --> 09:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
disconnect
 
09:59:52.350 --> 09:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
between the purpose of this
 
09:59:55.390 --> 09:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
bill and the UN United Nations
 
09:59:58.510 --> 09:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental panel on climate
 
10:00:03.790 --> 10:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
change the UN ipcc has been saying for
 
10:00:07.266 --> 10:00:07.276 align:start position:0%
well over 10 years now that climate
 
10:00:09.906 --> 10:00:09.916 align:start position:0%
change does not have a significant
 
10:00:13.426 --> 10:00:13.436 align:start position:0%
impact on a variety
 
10:00:16.950 --> 10:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
of situations that happen with weather
 
10:00:18.190 --> 10:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
and the
 
10:00:22.190 --> 10:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
10:00:25.710 --> 10:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
increasingly the environmental left has
 
10:00:28.390 --> 10:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
strayed away from that position of the I
 
10:00:29.470 --> 10:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
the UN
 
10:00:33.150 --> 10:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
ipcc and has has taken the position that
 
10:00:35.790 --> 10:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
climate change is causing more storms
 
10:00:39.990 --> 10:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
more Tor tornadoes more hurricanes more
 
10:00:44.070 --> 10:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
drought more whatever and yet the ipcc
 
10:00:46.870 --> 10:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
says no there is no direct connection
 
10:00:51.150 --> 10:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
10:00:53.550 --> 10:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
it's very likely that the work that this
 
10:00:57.106 --> 10:00:57.116 align:start position:0%
Council would do if it ever was able to
 
10:00:59.350 --> 10:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
get together and do any work could be
 
10:01:01.550 --> 10:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
done by someone else a single person
 
10:01:03.630 --> 10:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
maybe the state climatologist could do
 
10:01:03.640 --> 10:01:06.790 align:start position:0%
maybe the state climatologist could do
this

10:01:06.790 --> 10:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
10:01:10.106 --> 10:01:10.116 align:start position:0%
work the real tip off about what this
 
10:01:11.630 --> 10:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
10:01:11.640 --> 10:01:13.586 align:start position:0%
bill is
about

10:01:13.586 --> 10:01:13.596 align:start position:0%
about
 
10:01:17.510 --> 10:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
is where it says that the council and
 
10:01:22.030 --> 10:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
its working groups May icit financial
 
10:01:24.470 --> 10:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
support including funding from state
 
10:01:26.830 --> 10:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
government agencies nonprofit
 
10:01:31.030 --> 10:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
10:01:34.310 --> 10:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
Foundations what this organization is
 
10:01:37.630 --> 10:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
really in existence to do is to apply
 
10:01:39.870 --> 10:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
for these federal grants and these
 
10:01:44.670 --> 10:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
Foundation grants to try to build up a a
 
10:01:46.586 --> 10:01:46.596 align:start position:0%
fund of
 
10:01:48.950 --> 10:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
money that government can then turn
 
10:01:51.586 --> 10:01:51.596 align:start position:0%
around and use
 
10:01:57.630 --> 10:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
10:02:00.870 --> 10:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
chapter now the bill supposedly has a
 
10:02:03.870 --> 10:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
safeguard in it it says that the joint
 
10:02:06.550 --> 10:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee must approve and accept
 
10:02:09.266 --> 10:02:09.276 align:start position:0%
any foundation or federal grants that
 
10:02:12.870 --> 10:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
the entity receives the council receives
 
10:02:15.030 --> 10:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
must must also the joint fiscal
 
10:02:17.070 --> 10:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
committee must also approve any
 
10:02:19.830 --> 10:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures but there's no way that the
 
10:02:22.390 --> 10:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
The Joint fiscal committee is going to
 
10:02:26.870 --> 10:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
be able to find a rationale to say no if
 
10:02:29.350 --> 10:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
some Foundation offers this Council 5
 
10:02:32.190 --> 10:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
million or 10 million or $50 million in
 
10:02:35.550 --> 10:02:35.560 align:start position:0%
in grant money so it is not a safeguard
 
10:02:39.586 --> 10:02:39.596 align:start position:0%
 
10:02:45.906 --> 10:02:45.916 align:start position:0%
all so this bill in short is a premature
 
10:02:49.790 --> 10:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
Bill there is no mitigation that needs
 
10:02:52.150 --> 10:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
to be done about in the
 
10:02:54.190 --> 10:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
environment and there's no reason to
 
10:02:56.426 --> 10:02:56.436 align:start position:0%
collect a bunch of money into a
 
10:02:58.790 --> 10:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
fund just because that money is out
 
10:03:03.030 --> 10:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
there and available so I urge you to
 
10:03:06.510 --> 10:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
vote no on the motion of ought to pass
 
10:03:10.106 --> 10:03:10.116 align:start position:0%
press the red button so a itl motion can
 
10:03:13.070 --> 10:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
be made thank you Mr Speaker chair
 
10:03:16.870 --> 10:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
10:03:19.870 --> 10:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
cler okay thank you members of uh Mr
 
10:03:22.470 --> 10:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
speaker members of the House Mr Speaker
 
10:03:24.746 --> 10:03:24.756 align:start position:0%
I rise in strong support of the
 
10:03:27.150 --> 10:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan recommendation of ought to
 
10:03:29.310 --> 10:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
pass on Senate Bill
 
10:03:33.470 --> 10:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
543 this bill would simply create a 17
 
10:03:37.190 --> 10:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
member State environmental adaptation
 
10:03:40.030 --> 10:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
resilience and Innovation Council a
 
10:03:41.906 --> 10:03:41.916 align:start position:0%
council which would meet at least twice
 
10:03:44.630 --> 10:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
per year and consist of various States
 
10:03:47.550 --> 10:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
agencies such as Environmental Services
 
10:03:50.310 --> 10:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation Homeland Security as well
 
10:03:52.830 --> 10:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
as Fish and Game among others additional
 
10:03:54.870 --> 10:03:54.880 align:start position:0%

10:03:56.870 --> 10:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association New
 
10:03:58.746 --> 10:03:58.756 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of regional
 
10:04:00.630 --> 10:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
planning commissions as well as the
 
10:04:02.790 --> 10:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association and
 
10:04:04.586 --> 10:04:04.596 align:start position:0%
really not a left-wing
 
10:04:07.870 --> 10:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
organization um as incl included
 
10:04:09.950 --> 10:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
indicated in the bill the proposed
 
10:04:13.350 --> 10:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
council's uh Ro per role would include
 
10:04:16.510 --> 10:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
fostering proactive planning across
 
10:04:19.950 --> 10:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
state agencies so as to navigate coming
 
10:04:22.790 --> 10:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
environmental changes effectively in
 
10:04:25.670 --> 10:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
cooperation with our municipalities and
 
10:04:28.550 --> 10:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
the private sector and to those who say
 
10:04:30.190 --> 10:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
with all due respect that our
 
10:04:32.830 --> 10:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
environment isn't changing the data is
 
10:04:36.510 --> 10:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
there the facts are there I believe such
 
10:04:39.710 --> 10:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
proactive planning could promote more
 
10:04:42.510 --> 10:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration and cost saving to protect
 
10:04:44.390 --> 10:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
our taxpayer investment in our
 
10:04:46.030 --> 10:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and as a member of the
 
10:04:48.106 --> 10:04:48.116 align:start position:0%
public works and highways committee I
 
10:04:50.470 --> 10:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
think that's a very important problem
 
10:04:53.390 --> 10:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
address public health problems Public
 
10:04:56.830 --> 10:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
Health threats actually as well as in
 
10:05:00.950 --> 10:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
preserve a thriving uh recreational and
 
10:05:03.106 --> 10:05:03.116 align:start position:0%
tourism industry which is a very
 
10:05:06.310 --> 10:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
important industry for our state now I
 
10:05:09.670 --> 10:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
want to be clear the bill also
 
10:05:12.106 --> 10:05:12.116 align:start position:0%
recognizes the exclusive role of the
 
10:05:14.990 --> 10:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
legislature in enacting policy through
 
10:05:18.230 --> 10:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
legislation not the propos council it
 
10:05:20.390 --> 10:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
also recognized that only the
 
10:05:22.550 --> 10:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor would
 
10:05:24.830 --> 10:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
approve the necessary expenditures of
 
10:05:27.830 --> 10:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
state federal and private funds to carry
 
10:05:31.230 --> 10:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
out the council's proposed
 
10:05:34.070 --> 10:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
task and so I just I think that it be
 
10:05:35.630 --> 10:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
clear what with all due respect to the
 
10:05:37.830 --> 10:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
speaker I think the data is there the
 
10:05:41.190 --> 10:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
oceans are rising are are are so many
 
10:05:44.150 --> 10:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
storms I'm 66 years old I know our
 
10:05:46.150 --> 10:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
climate is changing because I've lived
 
10:05:48.470 --> 10:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
long enough to see it uh and it's going
 
10:05:51.030 --> 10:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
to affect us and affect other parts of
 
10:05:53.746 --> 10:05:53.756 align:start position:0%
our nation in other ways but we're going
 
10:05:57.746 --> 10:05:57.756 align:start position:0%
to get our share of uh of environmental
 
10:06:00.310 --> 10:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
damage whether it's the flooding in in
 
10:06:02.630 --> 10:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
towns like aworth and cin and I
 
10:06:05.390 --> 10:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
represent cin and that's a disaster that
 
10:06:08.150 --> 10:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
is hurting our municipalities but I I
 
10:06:10.310 --> 10:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
just spoke of the subject finally in
 
10:06:13.190 --> 10:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
closing you know we may disagree on on
 
10:06:15.870 --> 10:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
the causes of our environment changing
 
10:06:19.630 --> 10:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
but I believe we can also agree that we
 
10:06:21.510 --> 10:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
need to do something we need to
 
10:06:23.470 --> 10:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
coordinate better our government needs
 
10:06:25.710 --> 10:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
to coordinate better and I believe state
 
10:06:28.746 --> 10:06:28.756 align:start position:0%
government should do more uh to ensure
 
10:06:31.470 --> 10:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
in collaboration with our municipalities
 
10:06:34.906 --> 10:06:34.916 align:start position:0%
and the private sector uh to help ensure
 
10:06:37.586 --> 10:06:37.596 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire remains a special
 
10:06:41.906 --> 10:06:41.916 align:start position:0%
place in which to live work and play
 
10:06:45.390 --> 10:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
therefore please vote ought to pass on
 
10:06:50.830 --> 10:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
10:06:52.710 --> 10:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
