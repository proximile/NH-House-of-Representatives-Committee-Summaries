00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
the chair of Fish and Game James
 
00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.790 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
took me a minute I had to get through
 
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
the three and figure out which one was
 
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
the one I was bringing up
 
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
um because I have three of them here
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
today but this one
 
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to tell the committee that
 
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
I would welcome an amendment if they uh
 
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
so choose because the first crossout
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's on line five was not something I
 
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
did and we don't know how it got there
 
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
from OLS unless the department asked for
 
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 align:start position:0%
it so if the department had said they
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
wanted it they didn't tell me about it
 
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
but it was in here and it shouldn't be
 
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be crossed out the only
 
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
thing I'm doing here is adding a
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
definition of what it means to be in
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
arrears by setting a baseline of 25
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
dollars and the reason I'm doing this is
 
00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
because last summer I was denied a
 
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 align:start position:0%
passport from the set the the state the
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
um Department of State
 
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
my wages are garnished automatically
 
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
I'm like how could I possibly be in
 
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.449 align:start position:0%
I'm like how could I possibly be in
arrears

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 align:start position:0%
arrears
 
00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 align:start position:0%
what they do is they take how much would
 
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
you pay at the end of the year
 
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
total and they divide it up by how many
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
pay periods you have and that's what
 
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
they garnish out of each check and send
 
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.869 align:start position:0%
they garnish out of each check and send
along

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
So currently the the way the law is
 
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.949 align:start position:0%
So currently the the way the law is
written

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
as soon as Division of Child Support
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
becomes aware that you're in arrears
 
00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
they have 30 days to tell the federal
 
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
government you're in arrears and you
 
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
lose your government services it's not
 
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
just passports but lots of other things
 
00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the chair could Enlighten you
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
on the different things the federal
 
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
government provides that you could lose
 
00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
and it could be one penny
 
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
and for me it was a rounding error
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
because my pay periods didn't hit at the
 
00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 align:start position:0%
exact time that things were due and when
 
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
you added them all up by the end of the
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
year it's totally
 
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.110 align:start position:0%
year it's totally
equal

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
equal
 
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
but I had to go online with division of
 
00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 align:start position:0%
child support make a payment to them in
 
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
a in addition to what was normally being
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
taken out of my check just to make
 
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
myself go to exactly zero so I could
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
then contact again the state department
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
and tell them would you try processing
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
my passport again
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
and now at the end of the year I'm going
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
to be overpaid and division child
 
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
support is going to have to either roll
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
it over or send me a check back for the
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
difference because the whole problem
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
here is the small amount a penny can
 
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
kick you into the federal government and
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
when I talk to this the state department
 
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
they said the way the system's set up in
 
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire all we get is a red light
 
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
or green light a thumbs up a thumbs down
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
when we ping the system if they're paid
 
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
up to date we get a green light or a
 
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
thumbs up and if this in a rearage
 
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
thumbs down
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
we can't process it
 
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
for for a few pennies rounding I'm sure
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
this is this happens to other people
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
um but I wanted to set a Baseline and so
 
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
the researchers down at OLS did some
 
00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
research to find out what is the minimum
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
amount that somebody might have to pay
 
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
for a month and 25 was the smallest
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
amount that somebody has to pay for
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
child support so this would mean that uh
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
that seems to be a good number
 
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
that if somebody's in arrears more than
 
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
25 now you can notify the federal
 
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
government because it's actually a
 
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
missed payment or something rather than
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
just a rounding error
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have
 
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
any questions for Representatives
 
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.170 align:start position:0%
any questions for Representatives
belaine

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy during yes representative
 
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.529 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy during yes representative
Bickford

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 align:start position:0%
Bickford
 
00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
I'm using 20 thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.150 align:start position:0%
I'm using 20 thank you Mr chairman thank
you

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
um using 25 and they said that was the
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
minimum beat my experience has been it's
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
usually fifty dollars and did you ever
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
think of using maybe
 
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
um one payment
 
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
I did actually say one payment but it
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
varies so much from Individual to
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
individual what one payment is that it
 
00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
would have actually been a higher burden
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
to the department to try to figure out
 
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
what one payment for each person is
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
rather than have a specific dollar
 
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
amount is what I was told I asked all
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
this with the researcher we went back
 
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
and forth a few times because at first I
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
just said you know it needs to be it
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be set up so that it's an
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
actual missed payment before you
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
penalize people
 
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
and and that this is what they came back
 
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative spleen for coming and for
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
um so I'm still confused about how the
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
red light green light thing works so if
 
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
someone makes a payment for say you make
 
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
your your paid by weekday or whatever so
 
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
you make your payment this Thursday gets
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
taken from your check are you now in
 
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
arrears until your next pay period so
 
00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
like how does that this ties in with the
 
00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259 align:start position:0%
other bill that I had tried to put in
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
for accrual dates being able to be
 
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.309 align:start position:0%
for accrual dates being able to be
chosen

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
chosen
um

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
whenever they hit their accrual date
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
with the Department says okay it's due
 
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.089 align:start position:0%
with the Department says okay it's due
now

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
however much they've been sent
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
counts towards that and if it's off by a
 
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
few dollars you're in arrears until the
 
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.290 align:start position:0%
few dollars you're in arrears until the
next

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
until your the next payment comes from
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
your company that kicks it now you're
 
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
over right and so at various times
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the year you're over you're
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
under you're never dead on that makes
 
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
sense and over doesn't harm it over as a
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
green light but under is not even by a

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony I will
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
Trot down to OLS and get an amendment
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
and the amendment to be doubly sure
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
simply takes the strikeouts in line five
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
and six out and keeps the text correct
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%

bill

bill
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
um I was
 
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
I am here with uh the director of Child

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Lisa decotowski
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
with the Bureau of Child Support
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
Services bureau chief thank you
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
so we were here to testify on this bill
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
and provide some information but the the
 
00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
bulk of my testimony is actually geared
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit more towards the portion
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
that it seems like is not going to be
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
moving forward I was going to talk most
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
about why we would like to have the
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
medical insurance piece that was going
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
to be repealed left but doesn't sound
 
00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:08.339 align:start position:0%
like that's going to be an issue so I'll
 
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
not talk about that I do have written
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
testimony prepared as I usually do it
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
does talk about that I can still give it
 
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
to the chair uh to the committee for the
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
records if they wish
 
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like most of the discussion
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor was about the obligors
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
A rearage and change or adding a
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
definition to becoming in compliance to
 
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
be if the range is less 25 or less
 
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.850 align:start position:0%
be if the range is less 25 or less
um

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
I would say that there will be some
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
system changes involved with that from a
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
software standpoint as well as changing
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
costs associated with changing internal
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
policies and forms
 
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.569 align:start position:0%
policies and forms
um

00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
I wasn't going to say that uh
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
I guess I was curious what the what the
 
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
what the reasoning was behind it I I
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
just learned about it just now so I have
 
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
some I'm more prepared I guess to answer
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
questions about a marriage and
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
compliance some marriages I'm not sure
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
if I'm prepared to speak completely to
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
everything that was just discussed
 
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
because like I just said I didn't really
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
know what the reasoning was prior to
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
coming here
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what the committee will
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
find most helpful
 
00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll at least since you want
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
to add something about the thresholds or
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
just take questions
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
oh we could certainly take questions
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee I don't think we'll
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
just take questions okay great any uh
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
questions representative Craig
 
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:41.060 align:start position:0%
so um thank you um
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
sure thanks Pat and thank you for taking
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
um sorry it's a Monday Tuesday right uh
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
anyway I guess I was curious so from
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
your department do you see I don't hear
 
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
that you have any issues with this if we
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
take that strikeout if that stands is
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
there any issues from the Department on
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the the medical support
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
piece so the lines five and six are are
 
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
not going to be taken out so that's good
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh we want them to stay
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
um as far as line 15 and adding that
 
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.310 align:start position:0%
um as far as line 15 and adding that
piece

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
our position would be that would
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
would like that not to be added uh but I
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can point to a 4D issue
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
necessarily with when I say 40 I
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
apologize I mean a federal a special
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
provision in the federal government's
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
cfrs that tell us how to set up our
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
child support program I don't know I'm
 
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:40.019 align:start position:0%
not aware of something like that
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
specifically being addressed that I can
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
point to and say that it's going to be
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
contrary to federal law if you add this
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that it will require
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
us to make changes to our system and
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
change to our policies and I can at
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
least say that it could cause some
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
difficulties with the last payments
 
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.970 align:start position:0%
difficulties with the last payments
so

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
if for example somebody was owed
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
a parent was owned not the state but if
 
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
a parent was owed
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
25 dollars
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
we need to collect that 25 for them
 
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
I know it doesn't sound like a lot of
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
money but it's owed to that parent and
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
we need in order to complete our
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
mandate and to close out the case and to
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
actually completely have all the arrears
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
paid off we need to make sure we collect
 
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
that 25 So in theory I can see it being
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
complicated uh in terms of not being
 
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
able to use our general enforcement
 
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.650 align:start position:0%
able to use our general enforcement
remedies

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
remedies
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
to collect that last bit of money for
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
that parent
 
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.269 align:start position:0%
that parent
um

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
well there's that there's that as well I
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that's too many cases but
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
so in the case of a wage
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
garnishment and I I just would like to
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
make a disclosure I am a co-sponsor on
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
the bill but I do not intend to testify
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
so but in the case of a wage garnishment
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
that 25 dollars will be paid with the
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
next garnishment from the individual's
 
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
paycheck so
 
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
the system will receive that monies
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
isn't that correct yeah so there was a
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
wage garnishment it would be collected I
 
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
I think it probably would only come up
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
if there's a situation where we didn't
 
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
have a wage garnishment
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
somebody was self-employed or we didn't
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
know where they worked or something like
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
that but yeah so if there was a wage
 
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
garnishment being collected
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
it would it would be collected
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
the compliance piece is only if
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
somebody's not making payments for a
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
long period of time
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the question yes no
 
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
any further questions oh representative
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you uh chair so um I feel
 
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
like I have to stretch really hard and I
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
apologize to everyone I just want to be
 
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
seen from the corner my question is
 
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:20.540 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same as what I had asked
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane regarding I'm
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
still unclear as soon as if someone's
 
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
wages are being garnished by their
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
employer one would assume that as long
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
as they're receiving a paycheck from
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
their employer and working that they
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
would never fall into a rear so I I want
 
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
to understand how
 
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.610 align:start position:0%
to understand how
um

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
not changing the system could impact
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
could impact you know something like
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
this happening again so it makes sense
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
to me this idea that if you divide up
 
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
you know the payments over 52 payments
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
or you know 26 payments or whatever it
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
is that you might have the payments be
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
off by a couple cents each time that
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
um but I guess what I don't understand
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
is how what other type of solution there
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
could be to the issue of someone say not
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
getting a passport or having some other
 
00:16:15.009 --> 00:16:15.019 align:start position:0%
problem with the federal government
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
because of a rounding issue that hasn't
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
really they've not done anything wrong
 
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
because we don't we don't want to
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
penalize parents who are in good faith
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
cooperating with the system to make sure
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
that the other parent has what they need
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
for the children
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
so how like what are the are there other
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
options what can we do
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
um would a different number help I I
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Raymond if I
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
may um I would like to
 
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.889 align:start position:0%
may um I would like to
um clarify

00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
um clarify
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
um in the first instance I'd like to
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
just um make reference to the federal
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
offset program that you have referenced
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
um representative spleen the threshold
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
for the federal offset program requires
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
on a rearage balance to accumulate of up
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
to a hundred and fifty dollars worth of
 
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:18.980 align:start position:0%
our marriages due in a public assistance
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
case so a rarages that would be owed to
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire in order for
 
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
that threshold to be met for an
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
individual to be submitted to the
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
federal offset program in a circumstance
 
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
where an individual is not receiving
 
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance the arrearage balance
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
would need to accrue up to five hundred
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollars so there must be that
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
balance due in arrearages
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
so payments that had not been made up to
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
that value before the individual could
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
be submitted for that particular
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
enforcement remedy
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
um certainly in the event that an
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
individual is paying by an income
 
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.770 align:start position:0%
individual is paying by an income
assignment

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:05.780 align:start position:0%
assignment
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
then they would if they've already been
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
submitted for that previously once you
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
are submitted you are submitted to the
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
offset program until you're a rearage
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
balance is satisfied with a zero balance
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of the calendar month so I do
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
believe that that may have been the
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
circumstance that the sponsor had been
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
speaking to previously unfamiliar with
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
those circumstances this is the first
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
that our Bureau is hearing of this today
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
so feel um
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
unable to best respond to that specific
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
incidents however in terms of just a
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
rearages in general the bureau when the
 
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:54.140 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support Services
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
enforcing an order for child support we
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
look at what is due in the month so if
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
an individual has a certain monthly
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
support obligation that is due for the
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
current month anything that is unpaid
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
goes into the following month and is
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
considered arrearages what we would
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
consider our enforcement activities for
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
those arrearages would not initiate
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
until there was a consecutive
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
non-payment of 60 days so if we hadn't
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
received any payments on any current or
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
on any arrearages that were due for
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
consecutive 60 days than our enforcement
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
activities would not be an or our
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
enforcement activities would would be
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
initiated at that point of non-payment
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
so in a circumstance where an individual
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
is paying by an income assignment it may
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
be a situation where the amount that is
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
due for the accruals the amount that
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
child support is to be paid versus the
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
way that the payments are coming in
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
there may be some balances due that
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
carry over but again as long as there's
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
an income assignment in place we would
 
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.049 align:start position:0%
an income assignment in place we would
not

00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:11.059 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
in take any enforcement activities on
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
that uh follow-up follow-up thank you
 
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
um so in that in that circumstance
 
00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:22.130 align:start position:0%
um so in that in that circumstance
um

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
say for example someone has in a rare
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
Edge and then they come flush so they've
 
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
discovered that they oh and now they
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
have paid in and they're back to zero
 
00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:35.539 align:start position:0%
is the threshold another 60 days before
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh another contact with the federal
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
government for enforcement or is it from
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
then on if you're even like a cent
 
00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
behind you're going to be reported the
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
threshold is always to um the a rearage
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
balance so that the rearage balance is
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
set at that 150 dollars and then the 550
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
whether you're receiving whether it's
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
arrearages for public assistance versus
 
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
non-public Assistance or marriages so
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's um we report that information uh to
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
the federal offset program at the end of
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
every calendar month it's built in so
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
once that reaches zero then that
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
information gets reported if there are
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances where there may be a um
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
if there are circumstances where there
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
may be a timing
 
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:30.980 align:start position:0%
um challenge there between how our
 
00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:33.299 align:start position:0%
automated system reports that
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
information then the bureau is willing
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
to work with the individual and with the
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
um the federal offset program to help to
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
satisfy that uh arrearages that are due
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
actually have a quick question is this
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
something that you could do with your
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
system on garnish wages knowing that I
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
mean you must know what week
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
is going to be ten dollars short or five
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
dollars short
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
is that something that you could do in
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
your system itself
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
on a week-to-week basis knowing okay
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is five dollars short this week
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
however next week it's going to be over
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year they're going to
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.529 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
um so our income withholding the system
 
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:30.500 align:start position:0%
is currently set up if we were able to
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
identify the frequency of the payments
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
which I think is very difficult for us
 
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
to assess and evaluate if we don't know
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
if the payments will always be regularly
 
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:43.100 align:start position:0%
paid through an income assignment
 
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
so each case has to be looked at
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
individually to be able to make that
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm really stuck on the fact that an
 
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.490 align:start position:0%
I'm really stuck on the fact that an
individual

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
is involved in a wage garnishment
 
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
so that individual has zero power as to
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
how often the payments are made it's
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
just garnished from his or her wages
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
yet an individual can be penalized by
 
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
the federal government for being behind
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
for just a few cents is there a way
 
00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:33.539 align:start position:0%
you're talking about your
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
quote unquote kind of discussions with
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
the Federal Branch but if this person is
 
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.710 align:start position:0%
the Federal Branch but if this person is
denied

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
denied
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
a passport because of a few cents
 
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:57.110 align:start position:0%
isn't it
counterproductive

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I appreciate
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.730 align:start position:0%
the question
um

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
the again I um and I was not prepared to
 
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
come here today to speak uh fluently in
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
regards to the federal offset program
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
and how that particular program works
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing and able to
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
provide the committee more information
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
in reference to that certainly if an
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
individual is
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
um looking certainly if an individual
 
00:24:29.049 --> 00:24:29.059 align:start position:0%
had previously been
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
submitted for the federal offset program
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
on a rear edge requirement and met that
 
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.070 align:start position:0%
on a rear edge requirement and met that
threshold

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
to pay the arrears that were due and are
 
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
now currently paying uh their current
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
and ongoing amount by a wage garnishment
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
the bureau would take those facts and
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances into consideration and
 
00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:51.539 align:start position:0%
look at all of those circumstances again
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis I believe that
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
it is difficult for the bureau to
 
00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.270 align:start position:0%
it is difficult for the bureau to
um

00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
State one way or another uh whether or
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
not it is certainly a hardship as you
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
had referenced for the obligor the
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
individual paying again keeping in mind
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
that our role is to collect and enforce
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
on current and a rearrages due for the
 
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
families that we serve and to assist
 
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:24.299 align:start position:0%
with the obligors in engaging and if
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
there's an income assignment holding in
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
place we would have to take that into
 
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.049 align:start position:0%
place we would have to take that into
consideration

00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:30.590 align:start position:0%
consideration
um

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative panic
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
how long does it take
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
from the time you notify the feds
 
00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
and the FEDS
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
take off
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
so the circle thank you for the question
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative appreciate that
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I would need to clarify the specific
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
time frame for you and get that
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
information for you
 
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
there is again there are specific
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
requirements in relation to the federal
 
00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
offset program and the passport denial
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
program both are different in how those
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
are satisfied and the um in the
 
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
Transmissions that go between our
 
00:26:32.289 --> 00:26:32.299 align:start position:0%
department and the Federal Bureau of
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal Services is electronic and there
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
is a um
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
there can at times be a delay in
 
00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:45.860 align:start position:0%
processing it's all dependent upon how
 
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:48.539 align:start position:0%
the federal bureau receives that I would
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
need to get that specific time frame for
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
you though I don't have that available I
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up question
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
um so in essence what you're telling me
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
is if
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
the person is up to date
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
the time that it takes
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
your organization to notify the Federal
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
the feds
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
and they were up to date they still can
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
be penalized and not be able to get a
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
passport or leave the country is what
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I appreciate
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
that question also there is a
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
there is a process in place that allows
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
us to communicate directly with our
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
federal passport Partners to inform them
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
that an individual is in compliance
 
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
there's also a telephone number and a
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
process where the individual who's
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
responsible to pay the obabor in the
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
circumstance can also contact
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
them and we do try to work with our
 
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
obligors as quickly as possible to get
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
them that information when they become
 
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
in compliance thank you you're welcome
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
any further questions CNN thank you oh
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
those are another one representative
 
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.750 align:start position:0%
those are another one representative
Bickford

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
Bickford
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
um and thank you
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
um I've heard a couple of numbers here
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
150 dollars and uh 550 depending on
 
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
whether it's Public Assistance or
 
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.430 align:start position:0%
whether it's Public Assistance or
otherwise

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
and so I'm curious if that would be a
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
better number here and whatever we do
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
here on this line that we're talking
 
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.370 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure how to answer that
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
question in terms of what is the best I
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
I did not have an opportunity to consult
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor prior to the creation
 
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
of this or have any input previously
 
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
prior to this so I think that certainly
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
um you know the bureau would have to
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
take your question into consideration
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
and determine what may be a best
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
solution to this circumstance
 
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.390 align:start position:0%
solution to this circumstance
um

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
well what
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
how to thank you I'm not sure how to
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
answer that in terms of time
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
this depends well what we're not gonna
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
make a policy
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this legislation I
 
00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:30.049 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this legislation I
guess

00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
our position is can be better to not
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
have that provision there is when I set
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
up the outset
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
um you know if if the committee needs
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
some additional information on the
 
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
federal offset program I certainly do
 
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
that and they could take that
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
consideration when when weighing this
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
policy decision but I don't know I don't
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
know if we're able to comment on whether
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
or not we could change that partial
 
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.289 align:start position:0%
or not we could change that partial
level

00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:54.909 align:start position:0%
level
um

00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
well let me clarify if I may I'm I'm
 
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
just asking what would fix the problem
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
not what you want
 
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
was playing with terms of the offset
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
program is you know those are those are
 
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
federal requirements that are placed
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
upon us that
 
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
very much automated process
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
um and this legislation
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
generally deals with how New Hampshire
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
deals with whether in order someone's in
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
confines or not so we would still have
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
to report these figures to the federal
 
00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
to report these figures to the federal
government

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
regardless it will be my understanding
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
of the offset program so
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
it is in terms of arrears in general I
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of questions come up
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
with the readers
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
60 days in arrears I mean 60 days
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
non-payment and I think we talked about
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
that briefly as well someone could be in
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
arrears and still be in compliance
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
I mean someone could get an order
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
today that's retroactive a couple months
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
ago and be in arrears
 
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
and be in compliance to start making
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
payments and nothing they've done
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
but the figures still need to be
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
reported to the federal government
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
and that's the requirement of our
 
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
program so I don't know if I I don't
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
know if we can make a recommendation on
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
what to do if anything with line 15. uh
 
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
one more uh
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
when we passed and I was here when we
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
passed wage garnishment
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
and I I fought it quite a bit because
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's very Draconian and it only takes
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
certain people
 
00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
the people from Boston came up because
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
this committee was not very enthused
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
and so the folks in Boston came up and
 
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.370 align:start position:0%
and so the folks in Boston came up and
said

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
you don't pass this you lose 21 million
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
dollars of your Social Security
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
um for the money
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
uh but we found a way to have another
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
way of doing things which is to have the
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
accounts that people can in other words
 
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
not it's not totally mandatory because
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
we found a way to do it and that's why
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you try to find a way
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
to fix the problem with the fetch
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
because we got to do something here I
 
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.450 align:start position:0%
because we got to do something here I
feel

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
feel
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
then it may be it may not be quite the
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
right thing so I'm really it's I'm
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
asking you again
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do something like we did
 
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.389 align:start position:0%
trying to do something like we did
before

00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you thank you uh the
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.130 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
committee

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
um my name is Vivian Gerard and many of
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
you have known me as a Silva V Silva
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
case I've come up here and spoke with
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
you many times about this very issue
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
um I I am appalled that child support
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
can come up here and lie straight to all
 
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
of your faces
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
um child support does not follow the
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
court orders and in my next testimony I
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
do have all the backup documentation so
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh the wage
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
assignment yep okay okay now wage
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
assignments well but the 25 uh dollar uh
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
total amount of our marriage correct and
 
00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
if you follow where I'm going you'll see
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with this so child
 
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
support says in 60-day window to pay
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
partial but what they don't look at is
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
the people that pay uh that have the
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
ability to pay and have thousands of
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
dollars and com in non-compliance the
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
compliance with legal orders of support
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
is also what they they say that they
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
follow and I can certainly show you many
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
documents here where they've changed the
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
court orders they've
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
change the wage assignments they don't
 
00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.769 align:start position:0%
change the wage assignments they don't
follow

00:33:59.769 --> 00:33:59.779 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:03.539 align:start position:0%
garnishment yes and if you look at yep
 
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the wage garnishments
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
that I have here
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
I have their audit
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
I have the previous
 
00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:13.970 align:start position:0%
I have the previous
um

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
give me one second
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
so I have the court orders that say what
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
the amount should be garnished from the
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
from the paychecks
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
when they were supposed to start I even
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
show the fact that they say that they're
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
going to take x amount of money out
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
every single month and that's not what
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
they're doing they make up their own
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
rules they say that they're in
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
compliance with the legal orders of
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
support based on their their uh bill
 
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.990 align:start position:0%
support based on their their uh bill
here

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
so they're saying that
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
they are following court orders ongoing
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
payments is but are not they're not
 
00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
being followed based on child support
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
they do not follow it child support is
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
not being held accountable for the
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
following courses we're not seeing where
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
this ties into the uh so if they're
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
saying that they're taking out wage
 
00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
assignments for instance so this person
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
that was getting garnished uh wasn't
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
able to get his passport wasn't able to
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
fly wasn't able no that's what that's
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get to so I have so
 
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
in my case there's 46 actually it was 51
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
000 that were all based on child support
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
arrears not once was the person losing a
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
license losing a passport never got any
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
type of enforcement even though I have a
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
letter here that says
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
child support is enforcing so I'd like
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
you know they are they're up here saying
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
that this stuff is being followed this
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
stuff is happening but I can show you
 
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.450 align:start position:0%
stuff is happening but I can show you
clear

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:46.460 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
documents right here which you're going
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
to get in the next package that they are
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
not following what they're saying that
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
they're in compliance of doing they're
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
up here lying to your face saying that
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
they are in compliance at Fallen orders
 
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
okay the chair is going to inter
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
intercede here and say this testimony I
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
rule out of order it is not to the point
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
it may be to another point it is not to
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
the point of this bill so please take
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
your seat in the future make sure it is
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
dead on accurate and brief well if you
 
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
look at it it says right there about the
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
order you may hand out what you wish and
 
00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this is uh
 
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:43.500 align:start position:0%

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:02.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.820 --> 00:43:58.190 align:start position:0%

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
chairman of Fish and Game representative
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.089 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:09.890 align:start position:0%
committee
um

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
I brought this bill originally my intent
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
was to try to uh change things so that
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
we were not forcing everyone into wage
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
garnishment automatically I have a good
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
working relationship with my ex-wife and
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
was paying her directly while we were
 
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
before the final divorce orders came but
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
when the final orders were
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
given I was told you can't send her
 
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
checks anymore now you must
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
automatically have the state handle it
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm like
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
why and then that because I wasn't in a
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
risk and I always thought that
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
garnishment was something that happened
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
because you were in arrears or you were
 
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
undependable what have you not somebody
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
who was in good standing and making the
 
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
payments all the time
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
but uh we did the wage garnishment and
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
it didn't become a problem until uh
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
my son wanted to go to summer camp and
 
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
my ex-wife contacted me said hey can you
 
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
pay a little in in advance to make sure
 
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
that we can put the deposit down for a
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
summer camp I said I'd love to but I
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
talked to
 
00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
you see what the division of child
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
support and they said we don't have a
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
capacity to handle an overpayment
 
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
so you can't send us extra to pay to him
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
up front if if you overpay we're going
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
to send it back to you we don't know how
 
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
to handle an overpayment and if I pay
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
out of my pocket
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
there's no record that I made that
 
00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
payment except for my own check stubs
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
and then if I it wouldn't be credited
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
towards my regular child support so I'm
 
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
like this is annoying maybe I can fix it
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
turns out and I I know more about it now
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
from rep Bickford uh talking about when
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
you passed the wage garnishment
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
federal law prohibits us from making it
 
00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099 align:start position:0%
an option except that an option does
 
00:45:59.099 --> 00:46:00.470 align:start position:0%
an option except that an option does
exist

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
to not wage garnish if both parties
 
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
agree to it
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
that was news to me because in my our in
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
our divorce process it was we were never
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
told hey you can avoid wage garnishment
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
if you both agree to handle it yourself
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
um if you both sign the thing saying
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
that you know you want to handle it you
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
can handle it
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
and so instead of
 
00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:25.609 align:start position:0%
and so instead of
making

00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
wage garnishment optional
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
I was going to do it so you could opt
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
out of wage garnishment found out that's
 
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
not really in compliance with the
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
federal law i instead changed this bill
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
to basically be an information one
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
and it instructs the court that during
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
the divorce proceedings they shall
 
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
notify both parties that they can opt
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
out of the wage garnishment if both
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
parties agree
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
so it informs them of their right to not
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
have the state get involved if they
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
don't want the state involved in it
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
with an exception because I realized
 
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
this three exceptions that we need to
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
keep in mind so I put three exceptions
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
in here
 
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
if either of the parties lives out of
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
that's just a collection issue
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
if there's a protective order in place
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
this will not be an option
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's a safety issue
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
and if there's a history of a rearage
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
already for child support it will not be
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
an option
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
because that's where garnishment becomes
 
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.990 align:start position:0%
because that's where garnishment becomes
important

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
so what you see before you now is simply
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
a bill that says that
 
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
the court shall notify every person in
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
their final divorce decree if there's
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
chilled child support involved that they
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
have the right to make an agreement
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
between themselves both parties to
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
handle it another way if one of those
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
three conditions is not applicable
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
and that the court shall also further
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
tell them that if they choose that route
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for keeping records
 
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
of their payments and be able to prove
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
that they made payments on time and all
 
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
of that and that's it
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:14.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford you bring a
 
00:48:17.089 --> 00:48:17.099 align:start position:0%
historic knowledge of this subject to us
 
00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:19.339 align:start position:0%
having served here before
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
well actually I always want child family
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
while 10 years ago
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's historical I was there for 12
 
00:48:28.849 --> 00:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
years that's historic oh okay
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:48:31.619 --> 00:48:33.650 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thank you
um

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
generally we don't write a bill that
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
says divorce hearing
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
um it would be for
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
um any child uh
 
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
support issue which would be unmarried
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
or otherwise married and I can't
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
remember the language it should be who
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
is the do you know who the attorney was
 
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
that wrote this
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
I do not remember oh okay I think
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
there's a number here somewhere that
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
would identify it there is
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what they mean though I
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
but if I continue answering and I thank
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to the reason it said we put
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the divorce hearing was because we
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
wanted people to know right up front
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
before they get into the child support
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
system that they have the option
 
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
available to them if they so choose it
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's written into our law but nobody
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
tells you you have that right
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so all we're trying to say is right
 
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
up front let's let them know I certainly
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't object to Any Time a child
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
support hearing comes up that that is
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
also notified that they have the right
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
as part of their child support to make
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
that choice among themselves as adults
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
with children that they both co-parent
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
but that that right exists in our law
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not giving them the right they
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
already have that right yeah I'm just
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
saying let's make them aware that they
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
have that right
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
of curiosity question for you because my
 
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.230 align:start position:0%
of curiosity question for you because my
husband

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
um paid child support by giving a check
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
every month directly to his ex and they
 
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
then would also you know have these
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
expenses that would come up camp or you
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
know half of a co-pay for medical
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
purposes and then he would just give her
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
another chest
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
physically um hand that to her so in in
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
your example how
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
um how was that how would that
 
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.370 align:start position:0%
um how was that how would that
um

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
payment for Camp
 
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.089 align:start position:0%
payment for Camp
um

00:50:32.089 --> 00:50:32.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
be provided to your ex
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
I just gave her check yeah yeah I mean
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
it was more important for him to go to
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
Camp than for me to get accredited but I
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
found out that this was it was just kind
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
of annoying because she was asking me to
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
just pay up front a little more extra we
 
00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
didn't need to have additional child
 
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
support to cover this right we always
 
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:52.859 align:start position:0%
split those expenses and I was going to
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
pay for half the camp anyway but she
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
needed help with her part of the half of
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
the deposit wanted me to pay early and
 
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
it wasn't an option that was available
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
to me to be credited so just
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
it went uncredited
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
so this has nothing really to do with
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
deadbeat dads or
 
00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:17.470 align:start position:0%
deadbeat dads or
um

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
no Department not doing its job or
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
anything this is simply communicating
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
something that we legally may know but
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't guess so now we simply
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
told it exactly this is just letting
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
um the two
 
00:51:33.059 --> 00:51:34.790 align:start position:0%
um the two
adults

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
adults
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
with their co-parented children make a
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
decision how best to handle the transfer
 
00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:42.059 align:start position:0%
of payments from one to the other
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and whether it and and the like I
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
said it's all written in the RSA already
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
they have the option to both agree to go
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
outside of that system
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
um but we're not told that that right
 
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
exists did you do any looking around to
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
see what some other states do because
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
having lived in several different states
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
and having numbers of people under my
 
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.510 align:start position:0%
and having numbers of people under my
care

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
this was how it was done
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
one of them gave the other one a check
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
and only if somebody got really bad did
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
they have to garnish wages and that was
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding Mr chairman thank you
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
for the question uh and why I was
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
confused that I was being garnished
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
immediately and it turns out that rep
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
Bickford could probably tell you more
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
about this but the feds changed their
 
00:52:25.079 --> 00:52:26.329 align:start position:0%
about this but the feds changed their
regulation

00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
and the state was okay with it because
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
the state gets money for every case to
 
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.390 align:start position:0%
the state gets money for every case to
handle

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
so the more that go through the wage
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
garnishment the more cases they handle
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
and the more money comes in from the
 
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
you said the state changed its way of
 
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
doing it I'm not sure when and that's a
 
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
history question what what did they
 
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
change did they change that you cannot
 
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
agree to do it the way you want to did
 
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
that come off the table as as rep
 
00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
Bickford started to testify the federal
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
government came in and said you're going
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
to lose all this Medicaid money if you
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't garnish yeah but that's not saying
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
you got a garnish that's just saying
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to threaten you if you don't
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
so that was the discussion that happened
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
here that he talked about you guys
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
passed a law that said that now we're
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
going to garnish
 
00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
but it's still legal in New Hampshire
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
to do otherwise if both parties agree
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
and this is just something nobody tells
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
them that they can agree to do it okay
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
and you and am I right in saying that
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
you in anticipating somebody might find
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
an outlier case where this wouldn't be a
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
good idea you put in parenth Brackets
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
four five and six uh to say uh there if
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
people are in serious arrearage if some
 
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
one person's out of state if there's a
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
protective order so you are answering in
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
anticipation of those who say there
 
00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:50.099 align:start position:0%
might be some realistic objections or
 
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
correct okay I've hopefully covered
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
those exceptions where we would really
 
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the state does
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
handle the payment process I just wanted
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
to get fixed in my mind what we're
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
trying to do here
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
last call any other questions for the
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor saying none now you make
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
those who are coming up next will
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
address comments to this specific Bill
 
00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:20.339 align:start position:0%
to these specific issues or you will be
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
out of order we will not entertain
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
stories of what the department did or
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
didn't do and horror stories and people
 
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know and you yourself it will be
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
about this bill or the gavel will fly
 
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:34.849 align:start position:0%
about this bill or the gavel will fly
again

00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
with that the chair recognizes for three
 
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.930 align:start position:0%
with that the chair recognizes for three
minutes

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.530 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
committee

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
um as you are all talking about again
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
the wage Garners garnishments and at the
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
time of divorce people do get assigned
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
whether they're have to pay child
 
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
support Bureau or if they pay directly
 
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
to the payer at the time of my divorce
 
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
my ex paid me every single month exactly
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
what that court order was
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
as my cases went on and he was ordered
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
one amount we went to the Supreme Court
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
it got overruled five times every time
 
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
that order changed
 
00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:23.099 align:start position:0%
the last time that it did it was changed
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court remanded and and made it
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
payable to the child support Bureau
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
again and I agree with the previous
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
statements that every time they get any
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
type of wage assignments they get credit
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
for taking in all these arrears and that
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
was going to be one of my questions is
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
if if they're constantly showing arrears
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
on my ex's case why are they not
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
collecting the exact amount of money
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
that he should be paying he has plenty
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
of money to pay the wage assigned amount
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
does no enforcement happen and they I'm
 
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
being told that there's two types of
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
cases one is a wage garnishment which is
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
a collection agency only and there's a
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
title for d
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
and unless if your title 4D there is no
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement on these orders so how are
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
you objecting to this bill so I feel
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
that basically on this bill they're
 
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
trying to enforce things and and say
 
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
that garnishment of wages that become
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
mandatory and both parties to detail
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
their preferred form of payment so if we
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
had a preferred form of payment where I
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
actually got the check from him then I
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be dealing with 2018 to 2020
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
them taking out the wrong amount he
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
would have been as told to pay the 1666
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
per the court order and then somebody in
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
child support put that whole case on
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
hold it was not their job to put it on
 
00:56:55.849 --> 00:56:55.859 align:start position:0%
hold their job was to follow the court
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
order so from 2018 to 2020 and I have
 
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
copies of this here but that just showed
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
that what would you change in the bill I
 
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
would change the fact that if two
 
00:57:10.809 --> 00:57:10.819 align:start position:0%
parties are willing to pay that amount
 
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
that in in my case at first it was 1666.
 
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
if he paid me the 1666 I would have been
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
getting that money right along okay
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's the bill that's the law your
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
objection is somebody didn't follow that
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
and that is not germane to the bill that
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
is a complaint you have against somebody
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
who didn't do their job but what I'm
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
saying is if if the bill wasn't forced
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
to pay child support he would have been
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
paying me directly and he would have
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
been on time every time
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
because he had plenty of money to do it
 
00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:44.819 align:start position:0%
so if you two agreed to that then it
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
would have happened and that's what this
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
bill wants but the bill what I'm saying
 
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
is somebody in the title 4D through the
 
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
state somebody is changing my case okay
 
00:58:00.849 --> 00:58:00.859 align:start position:0%
that's not the bill that is your case
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
yeah but the bill shows uh let's see
 
00:58:05.579 --> 00:58:06.349 align:start position:0%
yeah but the bill shows uh let's see
here

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
so first of all like on part of this it
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
says that that they shall notify both
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
parties that hasn't happened okay that's
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
not the bill the bill says what they
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
should do if this didn't happen you have
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
a beef with somebody but it's not here
 
00:58:38.049 --> 00:58:38.059 align:start position:0%
you're one
 
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
non-germaine statement away from ending
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
other whole
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
problems that you guys are not
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
anticipating I've been living this for
 
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
nine years and I just feel that by you
 
00:58:57.289 --> 00:58:57.299 align:start position:0%
guys not understanding what is happening
 
00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:00.299 align:start position:0%
on the real side of life from people
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
like me and I'm the okay thank you I've
 
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
shut your mic off now and I would simply
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
say that uh
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
having gotten to know my committee I
 
00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
think most of us live on the real side
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
of life
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think most of us have a back story
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
most of us have some complaints or have
 
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
close loved ones who do the chair now
 
00:59:22.329 --> 00:59:22.339 align:start position:0%
recognizes The Honorable Betty gay
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
alumna of this committee time to speak
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
by the way Jody if you want to get your
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
mic close to you we could hardly hear
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
you last time
 
00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:39.289 align:start position:0%
you last time
no

00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to comment on a
 
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
reference that was made a few minutes
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
ago about the choice it sounded like it
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
was the statement was that there's
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
really no pressure to make people go
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
through the state when they pay child
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
support but it's Financial pressure that
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
exists and in previous bills there's
 
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
been an attempt to simplify child
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
support so that the person who pays the
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
less unshared support the person who
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
pays the less is subtracted from the pay
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
the person who pays the most and you
 
01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
just have one smaller check being
 
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
submitted however in real life
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
we're always trying to protect our
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
budgets and whatever dollars we can get
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
from the federal law are really
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
attractive so it means we constantly
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
have this pressure from federal law
 
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
to collect and have the money go through
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
our our child support so that is not
 
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
minimal kind of pressure
 
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
there's going to be all kind of
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
encouragement to get people to do that
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
because our DHHS has to pay the bills so
 
01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
I just wish that we could change the
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
federal law so that we don't penalize
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
our own people making them go through
 
01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:05.780 align:start position:0%
extra steps
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
so that's really my my whole comment
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
that that is a big pressure
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
so your comment is really to the federal
 
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
law but
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
how about to the bill well the fact is
 
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
that the bill is trying to make sure
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
people know that they have an option not
 
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
to go through the state but I think it's
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
necessary to point it out to people
 
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
because the the default is oh you will
 
01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
pay through the state
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
there is protection for people who are
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
worried about not being paid to have it
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
uh to have it on record but as
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone can tell there's
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
been real efforts in the past to free
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
people from this Federal pressure but
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
money talks and everybody has a budget
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
will you take questions
 
01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:59.390 align:start position:0%
will you take questions
sure

01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a question thank you
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.970 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
Lisa

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
Lisa
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
I I was saying it so well in my head
 
01:02:14.099 --> 01:02:16.730 align:start position:0%
I I was saying it so well in my head
decotovski

01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
decotovski
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to get this one I know it
 
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hayes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
House of Children and Family Law
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
committee on behalf of the Department of
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services Bureau of Child
 
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
Support Services uh thank you for
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
letting us speak on HP 618
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
um I I guess two things I I think on the
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
outset I didn't there's a number of
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
changes that are being proposed in this
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill I just kind of want to focus on two
 
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
things and I have written testimony I
 
01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
can submit after
 
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.370 align:start position:0%
can submit after
um

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
and we didn't it wasn't talked about a
 
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
whole lot I don't think at the previous
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
by previous testifiers but uh lines 13
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
and 14
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
with respect to changing uh the amount
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
a wage assignment that was previously
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
uh foregone can be initiated again
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
um I can explain it more in my written
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
testimony but that would run a file of a
 
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
CFR that requires all states to have
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
that threshold be 30 days and that's why
 
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
it's in our statute now written that way
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
all right before you go on I want to
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
nail this point down while we're doing
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
it this is when a ray Rich period
 
01:03:41.329 --> 01:03:41.339 align:start position:0%
amounting to the support ode for two
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
months or more has accrued is it the
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
line item mine are not numbered on my
 
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
text oh sorry yes no that's fine um two
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
months and you say the FED standard is
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
30 days correct and I had I had the CFR
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
site in here that uh everyone can look
 
01:03:57.289 --> 01:03:57.299 align:start position:0%
at later we can fix this so okay we'll
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
take that problem away and I didn't know
 
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
if that was uh that wasn't really
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
discussed before so I know it sounds
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
like a lot of the it sounds like the
 
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
Spear of the bill is is
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
getting information to parties about
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
child support and their options and I
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
think that we can say that we think
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea uh I don't think the
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
bureau has I don't our positions that we
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
have no issue with people want to agree
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
to uh have their own direct payment
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
arrangement created and as we've
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
mentioned before I think in the past uh
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
there's many many owners that we never
 
01:04:36.359 --> 01:04:37.490 align:start position:0%
there's many many owners that we never
see

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
um you know it's only when someone asks
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
for our services
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
and when there's State assistance being
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
provided and then you know we can get
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
into a whole host of law sets around
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
that but
 
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
um that's generally it I mean if and it
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
says right on the uniform support order
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph eight and I can provide a
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
blank copy of the Uso uh after this via
 
01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
blank copy of the Uso uh after this via
email

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
email
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
for the committee's reference but it
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
says on the Uso paragraph eight uh
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
basically gives the court that space to
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
make the determinations that by the way
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
those terminations are also in federal
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
law uh ways to not have a wage
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
assignment if that's what the party so
 
01:05:18.059 --> 01:05:18.950 align:start position:0%
assignment if that's what the party so
choose

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any issue with
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
that I think probably the only other
 
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
concern that we would have is with
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
us developing a form
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we would be the best
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
person to do that
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
um I think that everyone's case is
 
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
different every
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
uh parenting case child support case it
 
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
says divorce case in here I think
 
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative Pickford pointed that out
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
already though there are other types of
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
cases that come before the court that
 
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily divorces I don't know
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
if we would be able to develop a
 
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
standard form that would address all
 
01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
contingencies I think that
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
the spirit of it is well intentioned and
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
it makes sense and the more information
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
people have about
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
how child support works I think it'll be
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
advantageous to all parties and
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
um I just don't know we would be able to
 
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
develop a form that would appropriately
 
01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
address those contingencies I think that
 
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
might be best left to uh the court to
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
explain when the order is issued
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
um also attorney counsel for the parties
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
if they have them probably should give
 
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
them an idea of how child support Works
 
01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.910 align:start position:0%
them an idea of how child support Works
um

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
we're certainly free to be a general
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
resource if parties wish to reach out to
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
us I know the court
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know what the early stages of
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
the Court's divorce proceedings are but
 
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a way to provide them with
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
our information so we can give them some
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
ideas about what we offer if people wish
 
01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of it but unless we
 
01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
get a specific application from a party
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
really can't talk to them too much about
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
their case and we don't provide legal
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
services so I really can't give them
 
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
advice either
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the more information the better
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
I think we could agree that the more the
 
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
parties know the better that the
 
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings go
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I I don't it would like to add
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
Elisa then I'm just happy to take
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions at this point
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Hayes
 
01:07:32.039 --> 01:07:33.890 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Hayes
um

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
on line 15 and 16. it it appears that
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
that's not I don't see it in the statue
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
and is that do you see that as an
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
addition or is that somewhere in the
 
01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
stature that I'm missing oh I thank you
 
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
for the question uh representative
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I agree with you it's not in there
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
those are those are additions
 
01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
um I didn't speak about them because I
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's necessarily
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
a programmatic issue with with those
 
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.730 align:start position:0%
a programmatic issue with with those
um

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the federal regulations
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
and our state plan address those
 
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
contingencies so I wasn't going to
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh make an issue out of them I would say
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
that it would I do talk about it in my
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
written testimony but it would involve
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
adding procedures and and there must be
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
a cost associated with adjusting forms
 
01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.470 align:start position:0%
a cost associated with adjusting forms
and

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
our internal policies but I don't know
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
if there's a programmatic concern with
 
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
those two Provisions at least
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
well I'm thank you Mr chair I'm
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
concerned with adding more
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
to that statute without having more
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
discussion about it I guess
 
01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.010 align:start position:0%
discussion about it I guess
um and

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
I did see the two months as opposed to
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
one month here in the statute are these
 
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
the only things that are
 
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
you know that's actually changing the
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
law that's going Beyond
 
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
notification to the parties
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
so that's my
 
01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.769 align:start position:0%
so that's my
concern

01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:07.610 align:start position:0%
concern
um

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
my preference would be to strike the
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
additions in the law
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
I I if I may respond please chairman
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
um are you referring to I don't have the
 
01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:20.930 align:start position:0%
um are you referring to I don't have the
current

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:21.769 align:start position:0%
current
foreign

01:09:21.769 --> 01:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
statue in front of me but are you
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
referring to the fact that maybe I'm
 
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
because I picked up on this as well that
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
those two editions sort of change the
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
notice and the notice requirement that
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
is found in the uh
 
01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contest
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph I'm looking oh I may um
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
because it's sort of the way that it's
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
written does sort of change how
 
01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
uh the current statute's meant to be
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
written in terms of notice and
 
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
that's what you're referring to I I
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
agree drafting wise could be problematic
 
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
well it's the out-of-state thing and why
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
that needs to be there
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
on line 15.
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
even 16 for that matter I don't see it
 
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
goes in the statute or maybe I'm
 
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
no it's an addition from the bill excuse
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
me it is on and the bill does add those
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
two they're not there before so that
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
would be a new requirement yes it would
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
I imagine it would expand wage
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
garnishments but again I think that our
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
position is that that would be a policy
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
decision for this com for the
 
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
legislature I think I was going to
 
01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
comment on those I just want to know if
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
we saw things the same I I think we do
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
I would suggest representative Spillane
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
that you take counsel with Council
 
01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
um on the way to walking to OLS to
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
certainly change two months to 30 days
 
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
which I don't think we would have any
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
problem with doing and uh yeah see what
 
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
they can what what you want to do
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
um I missed part of it uh I I do like
 
01:11:12.239 --> 01:11:13.610 align:start position:0%
um I missed part of it uh I I do like
the

01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
um three carve outs you made in here I
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
think that makes the bill good uh better
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
um than it could have been but um yeah
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
well if you would not mind walking down
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
to OLS and and doing an amendment on
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we can have that presented when we
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
would that bring I bring uh hearing on
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 618 to a close and we have
 
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
about a seven minute recess before the
 
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
stated time for the next bill and if you
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
haven't yet bought your Girl Scout
 
01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:55.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
did you sign up for some Girl Scout
 
01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.770 align:start position:0%
did you sign up for some Girl Scout
cookies

01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
cookies
 
01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:53.890 align:start position:0%
cookies
okay

01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:53.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
chair now opens the hearing on House
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 583 an act relative to the
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
termination of child supports and calls
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
upon the Bill's Prime sponsor the
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
chairman of fishing game representative
 
01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
James Spillane
 
01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:40.689 align:start position:0%
James Spillane
foreign

01:24:40.689 --> 01:24:40.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
committee I'm glad you're still
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
entertaining me here this morning
 
01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:48.410 align:start position:0%
entertaining me here this morning
um

01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
this one is probably going to be the
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
most controversial of the three that I
 
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.110 align:start position:0%
most controversial of the three that I
presented

01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
presented
 
01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
um but I hope you'll listen to reason on
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
it and I'm going to start out by telling
 
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
you that my son turns 18 next month
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
and I encountered this situation again
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
through personal experience
 
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:09.890 align:start position:0%
through personal experience
um

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
there is a section that's not addressed
 
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
by this bill and I'm hoping that
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
somebody here who hears what the
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
situation is can come up with an idea
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
how to fix it because I wasn't by the
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
deadline of being able to submit bills
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
to address that portion
 
01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
but we'll start with that because it's
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
peripheral to how this bill came about
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
it gives background and it shows another
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
issue that does need fixing if somebody
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
can come up with an amendment they can
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
put on another bill
 
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
knowing that the courts were backed up
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
following covid my ex-wife and myself
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
said well you know William's turning 18
 
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
in March and he graduates in June
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
and so we should probably file a joint
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
motion with the court to change the
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
child support
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
um based on him turning 18 and
 
01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.370 align:start position:0%
um based on him turning 18 and
graduating

01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
graduating
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so we did and
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
it was good that we did
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
because I found out uh
 
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139 align:start position:0%
I had assumed when he turns 18 he would
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
just fall off and my daughter who's
 
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
still on support would get her support
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
and his would be changed the support
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
amount would be changed for the fact
 
01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
that he turned 18 and graduated that is
 
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
if you have more than one child
 
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
support continues garnishing your wages
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
at the same amount once that child turns
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
18 and graduates and the remaining child
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
or children continue getting the same
 
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
amount of Child Support unless you know
 
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
enough to go in and say hey one of them
 
01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:37.850 align:start position:0%
enough to go in and say hey one of them
is

01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
no longer on child support who's 18 now
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
so we need to change the amount
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
so in essence what I was paying for two
 
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
children would have continued
 
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
for one child unless I knew enough to
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
put the motion in so that's the part
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
that isn't fixed by this that there is
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
no automatic way
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
to change the child support amount when
 
01:27:04.129 --> 01:27:04.139 align:start position:0%
a child turns 18 and graduates
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
now the part that is covered by this
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
is an egregious situation and I have
 
01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
turned over to the chair
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
my own uniform support Order final from
 
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
the court I have not distributed it to
 
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
the committee because it does have
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
private information in it however he has
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
the ability to read it and to attest to
 
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
what was written in it
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
the way the law is written it says that
 
01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:32.060 align:start position:0%
the child must graduate it must turn 18
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
so my child having ADHD and ODD and
 
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
we've been battling with multiple IEPs
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
throughout his schooling and uh urging
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
him and and helping him get to the point
 
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
where he's about to graduate may fall a
 
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
few credits short and we're doing
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
everything we can to make sure he
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
graduates with his class because he has
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
told us if he doesn't graduate with his
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
class he's not going to finish he won't
 
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
go back another year and he won't get
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
his GED he's just going to go into the
 
01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.950 align:start position:0%
his GED he's just going to go into the
trades

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
and on my uniform support order the
 
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
marital master in the court wrote that
 
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
because the law says that he must turn
 
01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.950 align:start position:0%
because the law says that he must turn
18

01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
or graduate whichever happens last
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
that this uniform support order changing
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
the amount of Child Support is null and
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
void if he doesn't graduate and that
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
until he gets his graduation I will
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
continue paying child support to him
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
even if he's 24 even if he's 32.
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
turning 18 does not end the child
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
support the way it's written now he must
 
01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.770 align:start position:0%
support the way it's written now he must
graduate

01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
graduate
 
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
and it's written right in there
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
to emphasize the fact that he must
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
graduate now if this had said whichever
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
happens first
 
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have this problem because he
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
turns 18 in March graduates in June he
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
would be out of the system for turning
 
01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:03.110 align:start position:0%
would be out of the system for turning
18.

01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
but then you might have the situation
 
01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
where you have a gifted child who
 
01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
graduates at 16 and then you're
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
depriving child support for two years
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
until they turn 18 because
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
they graduated first so we don't want to
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
instead my bill here will just strike
 
01:29:22.729 --> 01:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
the graduation component
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
if a child decides to quit school on
 
01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be or doesn't go back to
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
finish school you shouldn't be on the
 
01:29:32.770 --> 01:29:32.780 align:start position:0%
hook while they were a young adult
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the law that says
 
01:29:37.129 --> 01:29:37.139 align:start position:0%
that the child would nothing in that
 
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
uniform support order that says after he
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
turns 18 he even has to still live with
 
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
my ex but I still have to send her child
 
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:46.610 align:start position:0%
my ex but I still have to send her child
support

01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
so that's the issue we're with now
 
01:29:52.729 --> 01:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
um this is simply
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
striking from here
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
complete his or her high school
 
01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.330 align:start position:0%
complete his or her high school
education

01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
turning 18 getting married
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
becoming a member of the armed services
 
01:30:08.689 --> 01:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
or gets an emancipation through the
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
court are reasons for termination but
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
graduation is not
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and that's uh what I hope you will
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
consider the fact that that uh and if
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to say this doesn't happen
 
01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's just uh it would never be done that
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
way I'll now allow the chair to uh
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
tell you about my court order
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
having read privately the court order I
 
01:30:36.649 --> 01:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
will attest that what the representative
 
01:30:41.209 --> 01:30:41.219 align:start position:0%
says is written in this document
 
01:30:43.129 --> 01:30:43.139 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative representative Raymond
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Spillane for once
 
01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
again sharing some of your personal
 
01:30:53.209 --> 01:30:53.219 align:start position:0%
story with us I appreciate it and I
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
believe you a hundred percent that
 
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
that's what your court order says
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
because I've seen those court orders
 
01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
um typically in my experience
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
those situations
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
um where it requires graduation are for
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
our students who have IEPs or some other
 
01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.139 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
um learning disability that requires
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
them to continue school until they're 21
 
01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
and I believe we might be considering 22
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
these days the idea being that these are
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
not children these are not young adults
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
who are able to live on their own and
 
01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the skills to do
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
so so our education laws consider them
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
children until they have hit 21 or 22
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
and thus child support does as well so
 
01:31:39.010 --> 01:31:39.020 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
how would this law impact those kids at
 
01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
18 are those children or I guess young
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
adults now able to get some other type
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
of assistance for their living
 
01:31:55.729 --> 01:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
arrangements thank you for the question
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
there's another whole section of of
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph in here that deals
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
specifically with children who are
 
01:32:04.729 --> 01:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
disabled or are pulling Medicaid for
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
their disability and situations when
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's under a situation I don't have the
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
law and I'm not really familiar with it
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
but it comes under a heading of
 
01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
situations when child support may be
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
extended beyond the normal
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
time of turning 18. this paragraph was
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
only dealing with the standard automatic
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
termination of Child Support which as I
 
01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.850 align:start position:0%
termination of Child Support which as I
mentioned

01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
Isn't So automatic if you have more than
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
one child you have to actually go back
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
and ask them to change the amount
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it just keeps going if
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
I had five kids and I was paying two two
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
to four thousand dollars a month and all
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
of them turned 18 but one I'd be paying
 
01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars five thousand
 
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
dollars a month for one child
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
um unless I knew enough to go back to
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
the court and ask them to change it but
 
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
that's not part of this bill so I won't
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
digress too much before the chairman
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
gavels me out on that one
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
um so if I were to I'll pull it up if I
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
pull up 461
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
a it'll be under there there should be a
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
section that talks about uh reasons why
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
child support may be extended beyond the
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
normal period and it's some of the
 
01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
reasons we're disabled children those
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
who are pulling Social Security benefits
 
01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.330 align:start position:0%
who are pulling Social Security benefits
um

01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
um because of a disability Etc and I
 
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
believe it does mention 2122 or
 
01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
something in there thank you for putting
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
me in the right direction yep
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
coming before us
 
01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:33.350 align:start position:0%
coming before us
um so

01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
I have a situation I have an 18 year old
 
01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
son who has an IEP who's a senior at
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
Exeter High School I'm currently not
 
01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
involved in divorce proceedings but
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
his birthday was February 2nd so under
 
01:33:49.679 --> 01:33:52.729 align:start position:0%
his birthday was February 2nd so under
this

01:33:52.729 --> 01:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
Port would end for him
 
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
I didn't know how else to deal with this
 
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
because we do have a situation where
 
01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I toyed with ideas of saying
 
01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
um the June of the graduating of the
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
June of the year that he turns 18 uh you
 
01:34:13.129 --> 01:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
know but you're always going to have
 
01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
somebody that's on an outlying situation
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and like I said my my son turns 18 in
 
01:34:22.729 --> 01:34:22.739 align:start position:0%
March graduates in June if this was the
 
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
law at the time right now yes the child
 
01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
support would technically end in March
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
but I have an understanding with my ex
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm continuing to June anyway when
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
he graduates so it wouldn't have
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
affected us with our own situation
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
because that's our own personal
 
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
agreement but
 
01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
follow-up it could affect others um
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
there will always be someone on the
 
01:34:46.729 --> 01:34:46.739 align:start position:0%
outliers yes and then I guess I would
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
need some clarification in terms of
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
I've had families come to me that have
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
and their child support ends at 18 very
 
01:35:03.649 --> 01:35:03.659 align:start position:0%
specifically that there is no longer
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
support after that 18 so I'm curious
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
about the law and how it handles
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities in so in my
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
case my son will be part of extra School
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
District until he's 22. that's the new
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
law change
 
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
um but if we were in divorce
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
I'm confused the section about when it
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
can extend that the other representative
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
was asking me about would cover that
 
01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
situation and that's an agreement
 
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
between the two people there's actually
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
a section of law that says reasons why
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
there may be a determination by the
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
court to continue child support Beyond
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
18. and under there are many reasons or
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
things listed that could be a reason why
 
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
the court could decide that you are
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
still obligated to continue your child
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
support beyond the time of 18. and
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's actually written in there in a
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
section of when can the court consider
 
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
going longer
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson I think you may
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
have some language that helps here
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I do and I am open to other people
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting maybe better a wording
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I completely get where you're coming
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
from representative
 
01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
um I do have
 
01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:29.149 align:start position:0%
um I do have
um

01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
thumb pause about turning the age of 18
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
period because there are a lot of kids
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
who are born in January February March
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
April May and from experience in my own
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
family there's a child who just turned
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
18 in January and will be graduating in
 
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
June and that support order is keeping
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
him in his home you know where the money
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
is very tight so I was thinking that
 
01:37:02.570 --> 01:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
might be the case with other people I
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily think it's maybe an
 
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
outlier situation so would you be
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
amenable to something like saying and
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
I I looked at a lot of different options
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm certainly the whole reason it's
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
in front of the committee is so the
 
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
committee can discuss where there may be
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
some shortcomings and what we can do to
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
go around those but still solve the
 
01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
problem uh of a perfectly uh able-bodied
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
child who decides to quit school at 17
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
turning 18 and still collecting child
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
support because they don't want to
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
graduate so I'm open to all of the ideas
 
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
that come before the committee I feel
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
like it's a situation that you know
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
certainly to see it written in a court
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
order against myself to say wait wait a
 
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
minute you know and neither one of us
 
01:37:59.689 --> 01:37:59.699 align:start position:0%
could believe that that they were saying
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
this and we came to our own agreement
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
that if I have to keep paying it they'll
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
just pay it back to me but that's just
 
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
kind of annoying
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
um and for how long because there's
 
01:38:12.770 --> 01:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
nothing in there that ever says it has
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
to cut off for him the way that it's
 
01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:15.890 align:start position:0%
to cut off for him the way that it's
written

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative ball for
 
01:38:28.729 --> 01:38:28.739 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me chairman
 
01:38:34.129 --> 01:38:34.139 align:start position:0%
um so if it um
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
were to say something like
 
01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
July 1st of the child's 18th birthday
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
the year of the year of the 18th
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
birthday if attending high school or if
 
01:38:48.110 --> 01:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
attending an approved school like a high
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
school or a trade school or something
 
01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
that they would at least finish out that
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
year keep in mind we have a lot of
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
homeschooled kids too at this point I
 
01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
would be wary of any language that says
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
they must be attending a school uh they
 
01:39:01.129 --> 01:39:01.139 align:start position:0%
could be doing the senior year of their
 
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and then continuing their
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
education yeah something like that but
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
somehow end it so that at least they get
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
through that year of their 18th year to
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
the end sure as long as it's clear
 
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
enough to not also bring in trade
 
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
schools that they want to go to next or
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
um you know because we're not trying to
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
force parents that's part of the other
 
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
agreement that they make am I going to
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
cover College am I going to cover these
 
01:39:23.689 --> 01:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
things and that's agreements that are
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
made in the final divorce decree and we
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
don't want to put something in place
 
01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:28.139 align:start position:0%
that makes it untenable for them to come
 
01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
to an agreement by forcing a situation
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
where now somebody's being forced to pay
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
for the schooling going beyond what was
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
agreed to already so
 
01:39:39.659 --> 01:39:40.390 align:start position:0%
agreed to already so
um

01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
obviously this is dealing we're trying
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
to constrain this to the high school
 
01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
period right that's what I was trying to
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
say within that 18th at least within the
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
18th year and the acquisition of a GED
 
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
you know would terminate that too I
 
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
think but the way it's written it says
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
he it doesn't say that it just says uh
 
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
that if he doesn't get enough credits to
 
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:02.689 align:start position:0%
that if he doesn't get enough credits to
graduate

01:40:02.689 --> 01:40:02.699 align:start position:0%
graduate
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
I continue
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
until he does now doesn't say until he
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
takes his GED says he till he gets the
 
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.570 align:start position:0%
takes his GED says he till he gets the
credits

01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
credits
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
if he quit school he just he's never
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to get those credits so there's a
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
problem there and it's it's basically
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
comes down to the way this is written to
 
01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
say whichever is later
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
you know and that whichever is later
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
puts you in this bind of it may never
 
01:40:25.679 --> 01:40:26.750 align:start position:0%
puts you in this bind of it may never
come

01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
later may never come so we need to have
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
a later
 
01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
that is that is a thing that's going to
 
01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
happen at some point so that there it
 
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
will always be an end to it
 
01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
and testifying
 
01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:50.219 align:start position:0%
um you know so there's something my kids
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
get Social Security because their um
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
their father died so there's something
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
they have some wording and I can't I
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
can't find it right now but I'd be
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
willing to talk to you and look at that
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
because they have some kind of wording
 
01:41:01.679 --> 01:41:02.870 align:start position:0%
because they have some kind of wording
where

01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't continue on forever it
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
happens either when they turn 18 or my
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
daughter was 18 in November hers goes if
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
when she turns 18 she's only 16. but
 
01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:13.139 align:start position:0%
um then it doesn't end until she
 
01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
graduates so she gets to graduate but
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
they have they have a pretty tight
 
01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.810 align:start position:0%
they have they have a pretty tight
provision

01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
so I'd be willing to look at my
 
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
paperwork at home and then talk to you
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
about that if this model language
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere that's being used by the
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
Social Security Department already to
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that they end their benefits
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
at a certain time it's worth looking
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
into yeah so if you would be willing I'd
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
love to talk to you about that
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you so
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
much thank you and
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Keith kernig from
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
waypoints who says he will be speaking
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
against the bill
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman of members of the
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:42:02.689 --> 01:42:02.699 align:start position:0%
Keith kenning I'm the average advocacy
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
director at Waypoint we sit in
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
um after listening to the sponsor
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
um there's sounds that like there are a
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
lot of problems that need to be solved
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this bill answers
 
01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:16.609 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this bill answers
those

01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
um and taking out the language of or put
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
taking out the language and only leaving
 
01:42:24.169 --> 01:42:24.179 align:start position:0%
when the person turns 18. just seems to
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
me that
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's a one-size-fits all to try to make
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
kids and kids are not that way let me
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
give you some what ifs what ifs and I
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
can share something personal what if you
 
01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
have a younger brother who's only
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
four years younger than you but the
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
parents have decided that they need to
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
hold him back here because they think it
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
would do him better to go in a year
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
later so he graduates five years behind
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
me and then what if your parents as mine
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
did got divorced and so they've made a
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
decision about their child and my
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
brother entered high school he entered
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
his senior year as an 18 year old he
 
01:43:01.729 --> 01:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
graduated he holds down a job he did
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
everything he's supposed to do but
 
01:43:05.689 --> 01:43:05.699 align:start position:0%
imagine if that
 
01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:08.219 align:start position:0%
support had been cut off as he was going
 
01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
into his senior year
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
what about my son
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
between his junior he was one semester
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
away from graduating from college he got
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
a severe concussion
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
what if that had happened during his
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
junior year or his his first semester in
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
high school do we cut off child support
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
children we all want to believe that we
 
01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:32.699 align:start position:0%
have expectations with our children and
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
if anybody has a child that just doesn't
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
hold true you have to adapt to what your
 
01:43:41.689 --> 01:43:41.699 align:start position:0%
child needs and so I'm thinking about 50
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
other things we could talk about
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
depression I think they say now a third
 
01:43:47.689 --> 01:43:47.699 align:start position:0%
of young teenage girls are severely
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
depressed what if someone has to drop
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
out for a semester because they can't
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
hold it together but they want to go
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
back and get their degree or what about
 
01:43:58.010 --> 01:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
substance abuse or what about just the
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
medical injury so I I hear the sponsor I
 
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
think he's trying to solve a problem but
 
01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:06.500 align:start position:0%
the the way this bill is written this
 
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits all is not the answer and
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to leave a lot of kids out
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
there having to choose between getting
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
their education which I think we all
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
want don't we don't we want them in this
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
high-tech world to get their education
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
or they're going to have to be forced
 
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to continue their
 
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
education and go to school so
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
I would ask the committee if you're
 
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
going to do something like this I think
 
01:44:33.169 --> 01:44:33.179 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out you know 22 and
 
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
the right language
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
um but not just eliminate this because
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me it's going to put a
 
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
lot of kids in a really bad situation so
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and happy to
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
so much for being here on behalf of
 
01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:52.669 align:start position:0%
so much for being here on behalf of
Waypoint

01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
Waypoint
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
um I just Waypoint still run foster
 
01:44:55.199 --> 01:44:56.330 align:start position:0%
um I just Waypoint still run foster
homes

01:44:56.330 --> 01:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
we do we and and so my question then is
 
01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
what what effect would you see this
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
having on kids in foster care because I
 
01:45:06.649 --> 01:45:06.659 align:start position:0%
know we have like a thousand kids in
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
foster care right now so thank you for
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
your question we run something called an
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
ISO program it's the Intensive service
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
option and I will not share with you
 
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
some of the horrible things these
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
children have been through at the hands
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
of their parents
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
it is beyond belief but a lot of those
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
kids literally need a team of people
 
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
six to ten people working with them
 
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
through a weekly basis to stabilize them
 
01:45:32.689 --> 01:45:32.699 align:start position:0%
and move them forward
 
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
if if you had child support in this
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
situation there are a lot of those kids
 
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
that don't make it through high school
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
by the time they're 18. you know I I in
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
the perfect world every child fits every
 
01:45:45.649 --> 01:45:45.659 align:start position:0%
perfect timing of the school and
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
everything that goes forward I have not
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
found that perfect world and and and it
 
01:45:52.490 --> 01:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
just seems to me this bill is a like I
 
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
said a one-size-fits all trying to solve
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
a problem that we need there needs to be
 
01:45:59.209 --> 01:45:59.219 align:start position:0%
more thought with this and it's much
 
01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
more of an intricate situation that I
 
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
think the bill represents right now I
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
hope that answered your question
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%

01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to say a few things uh
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
concerning this bill
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
I am in support of the bill
 
01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
and with all due respect to uh Waypoint
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
in all the amazing work that they do for
 
01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
the children of our state
 
01:46:52.729 --> 01:46:52.739 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to take into
 
01:46:55.370 --> 01:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
consideration the fact that
 
01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
they are correct uh when a child
 
01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:01.490 align:start position:0%
they are correct uh when a child
suffers

01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
suffers
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
from the issue of divorce
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes those children ages 16 and 17
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
just don't want anything more to do with
 
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
their families so they apply for and in
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
some cases are granted emancipation
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
now if this child is granted in
 
01:47:21.239 --> 01:47:23.470 align:start position:0%
now if this child is granted in
emancipation

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
emancipation
 
01:47:27.169 --> 01:47:27.179 align:start position:0%
at that point there are a multitude of
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
ways that they can support themselves
 
01:47:33.229 --> 01:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
and if that's their choice and they do a
 
01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
good job of it and most of them do the
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
law specifically States at 18 years old
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
that comes to an end
 
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
so if emancipation can come to an end at
 
01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:50.689 align:start position:0%
so if emancipation can come to an end at
18.

01:47:50.689 --> 01:47:50.699 align:start position:0%
18.
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
when they become a legal adult
 
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
why would a parent
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
have to pay child support if
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
according to statistical information a
 
01:48:05.209 --> 01:48:05.219 align:start position:0%
child decides to drop out of school now
 
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
I don't Advocate that I think that
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
that's probably one area where I would
 
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
use the S word
 
01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
meaning stupid
 
01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
um and and I mean no disrespect but I
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
think that every child should finish
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
school it
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
it just is however according to
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
statistics in New Hampshire
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
2.7 percent of the kids in New Hampshire
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
didn't even finish the ninth grade
 
01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:36.179 align:start position:0%
isn't that sad
 
01:48:36.179 --> 01:48:36.910 align:start position:0%
isn't that sad
um

01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
6.2 percent will not graduate high
 
01:48:40.199 --> 01:48:41.990 align:start position:0%
6.2 percent will not graduate high
school

01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
so if you're a an 18 year old
 
01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
and you choose not to finish high school
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's a very poor choice
 
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:54.830 align:start position:0%
it's a very poor choice
however

01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't it
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
make it easier for that child to do that
 
01:49:00.719 --> 01:49:01.729 align:start position:0%
make it easier for that child to do that
while

01:49:01.729 --> 01:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
that child is still being supported by
 
01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.139 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:08.699 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
pointing that child in the direction of
 
01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
becoming more responsible
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
and if they choose to make the bad
 
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
choice of quitting school
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
um get a job
 
01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.139 align:start position:0%
and maybe that will force them to go
 
01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
back to school and get their diploma
 
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
or their GED
 
01:49:33.169 --> 01:49:33.179 align:start position:0%
I don't think that parents need to be on
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
the hook to support their children who
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
are not going to make good choices once
 
01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
they turn 18.
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%

dekatowski and Matthew Hayes from the
 
01:50:02.810 --> 01:50:02.820 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:50:07.129 --> 01:50:07.139 align:start position:0%
House children family law committee on
 
01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:08.219 align:start position:0%
behalf of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
and Bureau of Child Support Services I
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving us the opportunity
 
01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
to briefly speak on HB 83 583
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say at the outset that
 
01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
obviously uh the bureau's position is
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that child support is a vital resource
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire families
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
and uh I can say that in many cases that
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
we've seen dependents generally a lot of
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
dependents do turn 18 prior to
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
graduating high school and that as such
 
01:50:45.050 --> 01:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
this bill could result in less child
 
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
support being collected for those
 
01:50:50.209 --> 01:50:50.219 align:start position:0%
families and that would result in in
 
01:50:52.729 --> 01:50:52.739 align:start position:0%
some hardships for families and it would
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't result and the increased need
 
01:50:58.250 --> 01:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
to turn to public assistance to help
 
01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
those families through those last for
 
01:51:02.810 --> 01:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
that last time period
 
01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:03.410 align:start position:0%
that last time period
um

01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:05.570 --> 01:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
in addition you know this bill would
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
have some impacts on our program however
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
up to this up to this Committee in the
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
legislature to make a policy decision on
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
how they invest
 
01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
um see fit to draft it and it's our hope
 
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
that if there's changes they can make
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
changes that are
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
advantageous to families in the state
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire I'm happy to take
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
some questions as well unless a director
 
01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
has any input
 
01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:37.860 align:start position:0%

chair recognizes Attorney Richard head
 
01:51:49.149 --> 01:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:56.219 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
um I have a very uh small technical
 
01:52:01.129 --> 01:52:01.139 align:start position:0%
request in terms of of this bill which
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
is a change to the effective date from
 
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
60 days to January 1. the reason for
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
that is RSA 14 colon 9 talks about when
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
effective dates should be set and it
 
01:52:13.729 --> 01:52:13.739 align:start position:0%
says each law affecting judicial
 
01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
practice and procedure shall take effect
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
January 1 following passage because we
 
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
have standing orders and forms that
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
incorporate the current language of this
 
01:52:25.609 --> 01:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
bill and we get a number of form changes
 
01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
and various document changes that we
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
have to do in the course of following a
 
01:52:31.689 --> 01:52:31.699 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
the the law provides for a January 1
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
effective date we do not have a position
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
on the policy of the bill only a
 
01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
technical request I've spoken to
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%

01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%

I rise today to introduce and support
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
H.R 14. now passage of this resolution
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
would establish a committee of either
 
01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee or a
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
select committee to be appointed by the
 
01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:44.390 align:start position:0%
select committee to be appointed by the
speaker

01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
and its purpose is to investigate the
 
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
allegations of denial of due process of
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
participants in the current Court Family
 
01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:54.590 align:start position:0%
participants in the current Court Family
Division

01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
Division
 
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:56.390 align:start position:0%
Division
note

01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
this is a house resolution for a purpose
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
because the other body I.E what we call
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh despite numerous bills
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
that have been passed by the house
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
attempting to address various due
 
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
process issues has repeatedly failed to
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
move them forward
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
further this resolution does not require
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial approval
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
the authorized committee would have the
 
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
power to subpoena and compel attendance
 
01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
of state officers including Juris and
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
dcyf employees
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
one may also consider including the
 
01:55:38.209 --> 01:55:38.219 align:start position:0%
ability to issue a transport order to
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
get those in jail to testify
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
the kinds of due process violations that
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
could be investigated and you have heard
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
about already in in earlier in earlier
 
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
bills is the waiver and suspension of
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
court rules rule 1.2 permits the court
 
01:55:59.689 --> 01:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
to waive any rule in the Family Court
 
01:56:02.209 --> 01:56:02.219 align:start position:0%
that's not prohibited by a law rule 2.2
 
01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
permits the court to waive Rules of
 
01:56:06.169 --> 01:56:06.179 align:start position:0%
Evidence because they are not deemed to
 
01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
apply you'll hear again legitimate
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
testimony where the existence or falsity
 
01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
of abusive relationships was denied when
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
that testimony could have been
 
01:56:21.410 --> 01:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
determinative of a fair and just order
 
01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
at a minimum
 
01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
all these all waivers should be
 
01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
the investigation
 
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
could also assess the issue of Court
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
recordings which are inaccurate because
 
01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
they have been electronically stopped in
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
order to exclude offensive or
 
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriate judicial comments
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
and hence the recordings result in
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
inaccurate or incomplete Court
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
transcripts that are the basis of of

repeated failure of the court to follow
 
01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
statutory timelines which adversely
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
impacts children and parents
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
there appearance from testimony offered
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%

hearings without final resolution
 
01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that although the
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
district and probate courts have limits
 
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
on the income of Judges the Family
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
Division has no similar limit I refer
 
01:57:35.810 --> 01:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
you to RSA 491 a

the complex and protracted cases also
 
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:41.580 align:start position:0%

Guardian metal item and therapist
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
a legitimate question is are there
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
Financial ties to contractors and

01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
numerous problems have been reported
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
with the Bureau of Child Support

01:58:29.089 --> 01:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
finally you've heard of too many cases
 
01:58:31.729 --> 01:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
where it appears the reunification
 
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
standard has been inappropriately
 
01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:35.810 align:start position:0%

applied

01:58:35.810 --> 01:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
applied
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
the denial of the existence of abusive
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
relationships as a rationale for not
 
01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:44.460 align:start position:0%

01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
too often a parent feels that the loss
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
of their child may be the consequence of
 
01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:57.659 align:start position:0%

01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
without the same kind of constraints and
 
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
regulations and laws that govern the
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
district court and the Probate Court
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
essentially the testimony that you're
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
going to hear
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
following me concerns a myriad of due
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
process failures
 
01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:22.070 align:start position:0%
process failures
and

01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:25.330 --> 01:59:25.340 align:start position:0%
have I and and because of arbitrary
 
01:59:28.330 --> 01:59:28.340 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion that is often
 
01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated and without
 
01:59:33.310 --> 01:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
justification the record does not
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
justify the the decisions made
 
01:59:40.609 --> 01:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
they cry out for an investigation to
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
determine their veracity and the
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
definition of a plan to remediate any
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
truths revealed
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
I've distributed and I think it's going
 
01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
around there's there's four testimonies
 
01:59:56.209 --> 01:59:56.219 align:start position:0%
of individuals who who cannot be here
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
who have submitted them through the
 
02:00:00.290 --> 02:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
portal for your review and knowing the
 
02:00:02.209 --> 02:00:02.219 align:start position:0%
volume of these things that you that
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
you're getting I just wanted to
 
02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
highlight uh these four
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
from The Honorable Dan Itza who served
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
on this committee for 16 years and in

Vice chair
 
02:00:22.450 --> 02:00:22.460 align:start position:0%
he makes the point that the laws
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately should not be causing abuse
 
02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:29.420 align:start position:0%
to our children it is it it must permit
 
02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
responsible parent or parents to provide
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
for their care and protection he
 
02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:37.619 align:start position:0%

supports the resolution and strongly
 
02:01:04.729 --> 02:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
recommends that the judicial guide to

system herself
 
02:01:44.209 --> 02:01:44.219 align:start position:0%
I want to read one quote in my 30 years
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
as an investigative journalist I've
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
never come across government corruption
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
so egregious as the corruption in the
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
family court system with New Hampshire
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%

entire testimony
 
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
and I also received the testimony of
 
02:02:11.209 --> 02:02:11.219 align:start position:0%
a young person who was impacted by the
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
court system and I only have one copy so
 
02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read this a portion of this
 
02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
for you and then hand it to you
 
02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
I cannot be here today because of the
 
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
trauma I suffered as a result of written
 
02:02:26.209 --> 02:02:26.219 align:start position:0%
orders that were full of unsubstantiated
 
02:02:29.089 --> 02:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
imperative disdain for my mother orders
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
that ultimately would lead to a new
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
series of trauma and harm
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
you see I've done I was diagnosed with
 
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
severe complex PTSD at 18 after
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
returning from being kidnapped the
 
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis as a result of years of
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse gaslighting medical
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
neglect and more and more at the hands
 
02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
of my father at 25 I continue to place
 
02:02:55.970 --> 02:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
my mental health as a priority and I'm
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
in productive form of therapy
 
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
it was decided that testifying and
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
hearing other similar stories could
 
02:03:07.729 --> 02:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
cause me severe setbacks this abuse was
 
02:03:10.129 --> 02:03:10.139 align:start position:0%
preventable had the court accepted my
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
parents final divorce divorce decree and
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
family history evidence upon entering
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
the family court system
 
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
my experience is only one of thousands
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
of children's being put through the harm
 
02:03:25.609 --> 02:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
and significant trauma at the time at a
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
time in their lives when they should be
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
flourishing learning and feeling safe
 
02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
as a child I had a caring parent who
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
protected us from abuse and harm our
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
respect this rooted in how our mother
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
gave great love and respect to us always
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
showing us the world and encouraging our
 
02:03:44.810 --> 02:03:44.820 align:start position:0%
growth we kids had safe and were safe
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
and secure with her and with one another
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
the court stripped that right from us
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
the safety from us and by doing I
 
02:03:54.410 --> 02:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
believe perpetuated future harm that we
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
are all going to suffer
 
02:04:00.530 --> 02:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
orders rooted in New Hampshire rule 2.2
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
this is the evidence rules do not apply
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
I ask your consideration through this
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
process and any process you're after to
 
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
bring your thoughts back to these
 
02:04:14.209 --> 02:04:14.219 align:start position:0%
questions does HR 15 follow a just and
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
unbiased path that could result in
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
healthy outcomes for all
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
children included does this resolution
 
02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
contribute to healthy public policy
 
02:04:23.159 --> 02:04:24.609 align:start position:0%
contribute to healthy public policy
preventing

02:04:24.609 --> 02:04:24.619 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:26.699 align:start position:0%

02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
if the answer to these questions is yes
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
then it is my from my experience in
 
02:04:38.570 --> 02:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
moral opinion H.R 14 could be the
 
02:04:41.209 --> 02:04:41.219 align:start position:0%
beginning to rebuild justice for all
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
please take my story and apply to all
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
the thousands of voiceless children
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
that have been abused and put in danger
 
02:04:51.890 --> 02:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
because of failures and due process and
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence think about New
 
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children that you will not
 
02:04:58.089 --> 02:04:58.099 align:start position:0%
hear today with stories like mine
 
02:05:03.169 --> 02:05:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is
 
02:05:08.089 --> 02:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
this resolution offers you an
 
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to investigate the truth of
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
these kinds of circumstances are they
 
02:05:18.050 --> 02:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
really happening or are they not
 
02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's a simple question and and the
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
committee upon investigation can make
 
02:05:28.250 --> 02:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
that decision and if they find there are
 
02:05:31.250 --> 02:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
abuses there are problems can propose
 
02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate fixes if they find there
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
aren't any then there's nothing more to
 
02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:38.330 align:start position:0%
aren't any then there's nothing more to
do

02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:05:40.729 --> 02:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
willing to answer any questions any
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much
 
02:05:50.810 --> 02:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
in cases like this where the person
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill makes a very
 
02:05:57.250 --> 02:05:57.260 align:start position:0%
thorough presentation the chair chooses
 
02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
to take one person in effect to be the
 
02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
chief rebuttal
 
02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:05.219 align:start position:0%
after that
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
we will go into the three-minute rule
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
and your testimonies will be limited
 
02:06:13.129 --> 02:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
accordingly it would not be fair in my
 
02:06:15.290 --> 02:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
opinion to go to that three-minute rule
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
right now so the chair would ask the
 
02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
honorable Bob Lynn
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee I I signed the card saying I
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
and I get I guess what I would really
 
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
say that I don't
 
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
far be it for me
 
02:06:48.290 --> 02:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
to say that the legislature you know
 
02:06:49.850 --> 02:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it doesn't have the
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
authority or that it that it wouldn't be
 
02:06:55.010 --> 02:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate in some circumstances to
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
investigate another branch of government
 
02:06:58.129 --> 02:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
I don't say that at all
 
02:06:58.139 --> 02:06:59.030 align:start position:0%
I don't say that at all
um

02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
but I am really concerned and I guess
 
02:07:04.129 --> 02:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is just raise it
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
raise several of the things that concern
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
me about this resolution to hope that
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
you'll think about it and then come to
 
02:07:12.410 --> 02:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know what you think is an
 
02:07:14.890 --> 02:07:14.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate determination on this bill
 
02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
the first thing I'm concerned about is I
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
can't help thinking that
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
um this is deja vu all over again so to
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
speak because if I recall wasn't there a
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
Sim weren't there similar allegations
 
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
made back around in the
 
02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
2010-2012 time period where there was a
 
02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
committee for redress of grievances
 
02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
formed and one of the or number of the
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
allegations were that
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the judicial branch Family
 
02:07:49.689 --> 02:07:49.699 align:start position:0%
Division had been the judges were
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
corrupt and biased and they made
 
02:07:56.089 --> 02:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
decisions without uh uh without uh
 
02:07:58.970 --> 02:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
proper a proper basis and as I
 
02:08:00.290 --> 02:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
when the when the when all was said and
 
02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
done and people actually for example
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
looked at the transcript or the tape of
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
something where somebody said oh the
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
judge just made this decision there was
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely no reason for it well when
 
02:08:16.729 --> 02:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
you go and look at the tape of what
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
happened it turns out there actually was
 
02:08:21.169 --> 02:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
a reason for what the judge did
 
02:08:23.209 --> 02:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm I'm
 
02:08:26.589 --> 02:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm saying is I'm really
 
02:08:26.599 --> 02:08:28.189 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm saying is I'm really
skeptical

02:08:28.189 --> 02:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
skeptical
 
02:08:28.199 --> 02:08:29.589 align:start position:0%
skeptical
about

02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
what you're likely to find now that
 
02:08:34.729 --> 02:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you know can I say
 
02:08:37.370 --> 02:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely that there's no no basis for
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
any of this stuff no I can't say that
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
but I can say that I'm skeptical
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
and what I can the other thing that I
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
can say is I think it's really important
 
02:08:50.810 --> 02:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
that you understand that you
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
that what you the the the information
 
02:08:56.089 --> 02:08:56.099 align:start position:0%
that is often being provided to you in
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
fact I think probably exclusively in
 
02:09:01.810 --> 02:09:01.820 align:start position:0%
these allegations is you're hearing
 
02:09:05.089 --> 02:09:05.099 align:start position:0%
complaints that either directly or
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
indirectly because somebody has
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
complained to their legislator
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
of people who are litigants and are one
 
02:09:15.649 --> 02:09:15.659 align:start position:0%
side of the story and most of the time
 
02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
they are people who have lost in the
 
02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:19.370 align:start position:0%
they are people who have lost in the
litigation

02:09:19.370 --> 02:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
02:09:21.649 --> 02:09:21.659 align:start position:0%
so they've come and told their lit told
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
their legislator this this terrible
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
thing happened to me the judge was
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
biased he didn't he he or she waived the
 
02:09:31.370 --> 02:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
rules when they shouldn't have and all
 
02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:32.089 align:start position:0%
rules when they shouldn't have and all
this

02:09:32.089 --> 02:09:32.099 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
you've never heard from the other side
 
02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:37.139 align:start position:0%
of the story you've never heard the
 
02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
litigants on the other side what they
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
have to say and of course they're not
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
going to come in they've they've
 
02:09:43.729 --> 02:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
prevailed in that litigation they have
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
no reason to come in and and talk to you
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
and so I guess what I'm saying is
 
02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's really important it seems to
 
02:09:56.330 --> 02:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
me that if for example you decide that
 
02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
you want to the or the house decides
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
that it wants to conduct some kind of an
 
02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
investigation I would think that the
 
02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
first thing that you that that committee
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
should do would be to go read the tapes
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
and listen listen to the tapes or even
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
order the transcript of the particular
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
cases where somebody is complaining and
 
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
and see
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
both sides of the story what each
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
litigant presented to the court what the
 
02:10:28.970 --> 02:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
judge said as to what he or she uh was
 
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
the basis for their ruling and I suspect
 
02:10:35.089 --> 02:10:35.099 align:start position:0%
um that you're going to find a you know
 
02:10:37.850 --> 02:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
a completely different story and I'll
 
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
just you know I'll just give you a
 
02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
couple of examples I've heard
 
02:10:43.129 --> 02:10:43.139 align:start position:0%
um not not from the representative who
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
testified before me but but I've heard
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the past from Representatives
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
tell me stories of things that judges
 
02:10:50.159 --> 02:10:51.530 align:start position:0%
tell me stories of things that judges
did

02:10:51.530 --> 02:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
did
that

02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:56.089 --> 02:10:56.099 align:start position:0%
you know I I spent 26 years in the court
 
02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
system I think I have a pretty good idea
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
of sort of how things operate and the
 
02:11:03.709 --> 02:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
when I would hear that story I would say
 
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
to the person well did you you know did
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
you talk to the person on the other side
 
02:11:12.410 --> 02:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
no did you look at the at the tape of
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
the thing no and it in many of those
 
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
circumstances it was really clear to me
 
02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:20.330 align:start position:0%
circumstances it was really clear to me
that

02:11:20.330 --> 02:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know if I imagine the worst judge I
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
could possibly think of in New Hampshire
 
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
and I assumed that that judge had spent
 
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
the night before drinking and was
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
intoxicated he or she would never have
 
02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
done what was alleged if that if the
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
story was only what the what the
 
02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:40.139 align:start position:0%
representative had been told had been
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
told which led me to believe there is
 
02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
another side of the story that we that
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the complainant didn't
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
bother to tell the uh the representative
 
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
who brought that forward
 
02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:56.510 align:start position:0%
who brought that forward
so

02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:59.450 --> 02:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
these are some of the concerns I had let
 
02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
me give you another a another example of
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
something I think is really important
 
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the record of the
 
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee that's the
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
committee that that investigates judges
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
for misconduct
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
you will find that the overwhelming
 
02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:18.649 align:start position:0%
you will find that the overwhelming
majority

02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
majority
 
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
of the complaints filed against judges
 
02:12:24.649 --> 02:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
are in family court cases because those
 
02:12:26.330 --> 02:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
are the ones that generate the most
 
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
emotion and hard feelings and you know
 
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
angst among the litigants that's the
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of them and if you
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
also if if we're to look at that you'd
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
find that the overwhelming majority of
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
those cases are dismissed finding no
 
02:12:48.589 --> 02:12:48.599 align:start position:0%
judicial misconduct because what the
 
02:12:52.250 --> 02:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
complaint is about is a litigant who
 
02:12:55.129 --> 02:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
lost has made a complaint that the judge
 
02:12:58.250 --> 02:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
was biased or the judge you know didn't
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh didn't see things the way that the
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
litigant does and in fact that's not you
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
know that's not misconduct I mean I you
 
02:13:10.129 --> 02:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
know the the thing that I think some
 
02:13:12.850 --> 02:13:12.860 align:start position:0%
people unfortunately have a real
 
02:13:15.649 --> 02:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
difficult time accepting and I do I use
 
02:13:18.109 --> 02:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
just the you know the the very basic
 
02:13:18.119 --> 02:13:19.850 align:start position:0%
just the you know the the very basic
example

02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
if I'm the judge and the question is did
 
02:13:26.689 --> 02:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
one of you drive through a red light or
 
02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
not and you say the light was green when
 
02:13:32.450 --> 02:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
I drove through it and another witness
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
says the light was red when you drove
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
through it
 
02:13:39.050 --> 02:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
the judge has got to decide that he's
 
02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
got he or she has got to decide what is
 
02:13:44.930 --> 02:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
the truth and if the judge decides that
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm contrary to what you said the light
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
was red
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
you may not be very happy about that at
 
02:13:54.890 --> 02:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
all but if you go to your legislator and
 
02:13:57.290 --> 02:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
say you're the only you know the light
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
was clearly green but the judge the the
 
02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
judge found it was red and there was no
 
02:14:03.490 --> 02:14:03.500 align:start position:0%
evidence of that
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
well you know that conveniently left out
 
02:14:08.810 --> 02:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
of that scenario is the fact that
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're another witness testified that
 
02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
the light was red
 
02:14:16.129 --> 02:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately as I I think is what
 
02:14:19.069 --> 02:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
is what is likely Happening Here
 
02:14:21.050 --> 02:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
the last point I would make I think this
 
02:14:23.330 --> 02:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
is particularly important is to the
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
extent that this that this um
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
resolution purports to request to
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
suggest that this committee would have
 
02:14:34.370 --> 02:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
subpoena power and that would it would
 
02:14:36.050 --> 02:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
subpoena judges
 
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
I think you're going to run into a real
 
02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
problem there because
 
02:14:43.370 --> 02:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
judges cannot if you're talking about
 
02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
any case that's still pending and some
 
02:14:47.450 --> 02:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
of these cases go on for years and years
 
02:14:51.169 --> 02:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
and years the judge cannot will not be
 
02:14:53.209 --> 02:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
able to respond to inquiries the judge
 
02:14:55.609 --> 02:14:55.619 align:start position:0%
cannot answer your questions it would be
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
a violation of the code of judicial
 
02:15:00.490 --> 02:15:00.500 align:start position:0%
conduct for here for him or her to do so
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
the rule even with cases that have been
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know that are sort of over I mean in
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
family law cases K even when a case has
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
been gone to the Supreme Court and has
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
been you know reviewed by the Supreme
 
02:15:16.850 --> 02:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
Court that often is not the end of the
 
02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
matter there may be further proceedings
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
and so the case may not even though it
 
02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
may look like it's over it may not be
 
02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:23.830 align:start position:0%
may look like it's over it may not be
over

02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:15:26.569 --> 02:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
and so again that would present a real
 
02:15:28.490 --> 02:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
problem with judges being able to
 
02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
testify in those cases I think frankly
 
02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
they would say that they could not I
 
02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
mean if I were a judge in that position
 
02:15:36.649 --> 02:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's what I would say and I think you
 
02:15:38.810 --> 02:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
don't want to end up in a situation of
 
02:15:41.450 --> 02:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
you know of some some kind of separation
 
02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
of powers constitutional issue there's
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:52.370 --> 02:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I want to sort of
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
Express generally about this is
 
02:15:58.729 --> 02:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
I'm very skeptical that there's really a
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
basis for an investigation and the ideas
 
02:16:04.250 --> 02:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
of you know the idea that judges are
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
corrupt and that they have been uh you
 
02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
know that they're somehow uh on the I
 
02:16:14.089 --> 02:16:14.099 align:start position:0%
guess on the take to to make to prolong
 
02:16:16.129 --> 02:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
cases so that they can somehow get money
 
02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:19.209 align:start position:0%
out of it
um

02:16:19.209 --> 02:16:19.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
really really skeptical about that but I
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
hate you know I don't want to be the one
 
02:16:25.550 --> 02:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
to say oh no it couldn't possibly happen
 
02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
could it possibly happen I suppose
 
02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest though is before
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature spent there's a lot of
 
02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:34.849 align:start position:0%
the legislature spent there's a lot of
money

02:16:34.849 --> 02:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
on this if you're going to do anything I
 
02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
would suggest at the at as a first step
 
02:16:43.490 --> 02:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
to say look all right let's take let's
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
let's find a few of the cases that we
 
02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
think raised the most concern for you
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
and have somebody go read the transcript
 
02:16:56.509 --> 02:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
of those cases order the transcript read
 
02:16:59.089 --> 02:16:59.099 align:start position:0%
the transcript or listen to the tape and
 
02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
then make an initial assessment okay
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
we've now we've now heard word for word
 
02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
what happened in those proceedings
 
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
um what do we think do we think there's
 
02:17:10.490 --> 02:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
a basis to take some further some
 
02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
further step I suspect you're going to
 
02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
find in in virtually all of the cases
 
02:17:19.009 --> 02:17:19.019 align:start position:0%
that there isn't any reason to do that
 
02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
um but you know but if you but if it
 
02:17:22.849 --> 02:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
turns out that there is then by all
 
02:17:25.009 --> 02:17:25.019 align:start position:0%
means you should go further
 
02:17:27.410 --> 02:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh with that Mr I'm happy to take any
 
02:17:29.089 --> 02:17:29.099 align:start position:0%
questions and I thank you for giving me
 
02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
 
02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative Lynn uh specific to
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
your last comment you made does line
 
02:17:45.049 --> 02:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
five and six speak directly five six and
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
seven of the bills speak directly to
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:57.070 --> 02:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
yeah well I I mean it it worded pretty
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know that it's sort of
 
02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.519 align:start position:0%
specifically says that we that um
 
02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.139 align:start position:0%
you know that you should do it in the
 
02:18:11.690 --> 02:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
following manner by sort of looking at
 
02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
the transcript first but I think that
 
02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
would probably
 
02:18:17.209 --> 02:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
um you know that would to me that would
 
02:18:18.349 --> 02:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
be the way that would make the most
 
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
sense and be sort of the most economic
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
the most productive of your
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
you know finding out if there's a basis
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
to look at to to see if there's some if
 
02:18:29.929 --> 02:18:29.939 align:start position:0%
they're If there really is a basis to go
 
02:18:33.049 --> 02:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
further that's what I would say
 
02:18:33.059 --> 02:18:36.530 align:start position:0%
further that's what I would say
um follow-up

02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
to stipulate to what you just stated
 
02:18:40.370 --> 02:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
then should there be further detail in
 
02:18:42.169 --> 02:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
the narrative
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
in certain terms of The Narrative of the
 
02:18:46.009 --> 02:18:46.019 align:start position:0%
resolution yeah you know what is that
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's not that's really a very good
 
02:18:49.730 --> 02:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
idea you might want to say for example
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
you might want to say that we will
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
um the legislature will
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
um you know select uh from some cases
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
where from those cases where it appears
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
that they're you know that that um the
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
allegations are
 
02:19:10.129 --> 02:19:10.139 align:start position:0%
um are particularly specific of
 
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
something of something in particular
 
02:19:16.490 --> 02:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
being wrong and we will assign uh people
 
02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:19.139 align:start position:0%
to go and read the transcript of those
 
02:19:22.310 --> 02:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
cases and see what you know if in fact
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
from doing that you you have a basic you
 
02:19:27.889 --> 02:19:27.899 align:start position:0%
you come away saying well you know we've
 
02:19:29.330 --> 02:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
looked at the transcript now we've sort
 
02:19:30.650 --> 02:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
of seen everything that appeared to
 
02:19:32.209 --> 02:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
happen before the judge and we still
 
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
have a question and if you do then by
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
all means that I'm not suggesting you
 
02:19:38.330 --> 02:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
know I I as I said at the very beginning
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
the last thing I want to say is that the
 
02:19:43.009 --> 02:19:43.019 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is like absolutely
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
Beyond touch it shouldn't it shouldn't
 
02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
be Untouchable you should have the right
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
to look at it I'm just sort of saying I
 
02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
I'm skeptical
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
um about the allegations and
 
02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
um you should I guess approach it in a
 
02:19:59.770 --> 02:19:59.780 align:start position:0%
sober manner is what the way I put it
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative D Simone
 
02:20:05.929 --> 02:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
to the representative uh for taking my
 
02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:10.429 align:start position:0%
to the representative uh for taking my
question

02:20:10.429 --> 02:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:20:13.730 --> 02:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
do you offhand have any idea how many
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
justices have been removed from the
 
02:20:17.810 --> 02:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
bench in the last
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
five years the last five years well I
 
02:20:22.849 --> 02:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
believe that there's probably there's
 
02:20:25.490 --> 02:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
two that I know of
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
one I one resigned I won a marital
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
master I think resigned under uh you
 
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
know under circumstances that released
 
02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.190 --> 02:20:42.200 align:start position:0%

s
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
um the judicial conduct committee is
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
working their best to do their job I
 
02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
think I think they are I think they do a
 
02:20:57.130 --> 02:20:57.140 align:start position:0%
very good job you know sometimes you if
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
does that mean that they you know that
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
they have sort of advanced knowledge
 
02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
that somebody has has done something
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
wrong no they typically don't but I
 
02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
think when they you know when they get
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
information that suggests that there's a
 
02:21:14.330 --> 02:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
problem with a judge
 
02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
they take action that's been my
 
02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:20.870 align:start position:0%
they take action that's been my
experience

02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:24.170 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
chairman

02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
to the power of two subpoena is that a
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
problem here or not
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
well I think in in terms The subpoena
 
02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
itself probably not I think you know if
 
02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
you're the
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
the the problem would be if you're if
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
you if somebody says to a judge I want
 
02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
you to tell me why you did what you did
 
02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
that would be the problem because the
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
judge the judge is not allowed to do
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
that all right follow up
 
02:21:56.450 --> 02:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:21:58.370 --> 02:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:21:58.380 --> 02:21:59.090 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

02:21:59.090 --> 02:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:02.929 --> 02:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
I certainly would welcome your input for
 
02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment for something like this
 
02:22:07.370 --> 02:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
um because I think it goes beyond the
 
02:22:10.750 --> 02:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
redress issue that was going on before
 
02:22:13.250 --> 02:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh my
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh since I've been back
 
02:22:18.770 --> 02:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
I've noticed a disconnect with the
 
02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
courts and understanding of what they do
 
02:22:21.660 --> 02:22:23.870 align:start position:0%
courts and understanding of what they do
if

02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
I can speak for myself this there's
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
something coming up
 
02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
and we've been told not to do it a paid
 
02:22:32.330 --> 02:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
person from the courts has told us don't
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
do it then we've had other people say
 
02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
come in and do it but I go like I know
 
02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
something I think I need more
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
information I would like I would really
 
02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
welcome having some kind of a study to
 
02:22:46.370 --> 02:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
do I was creatively of the family law
 
02:22:47.809 --> 02:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
task force I don't know if you recall
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
that or not and we came up with an
 
02:22:53.450 --> 02:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
incredible uh things because of the
 
02:22:55.250 --> 02:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
information we shared amongst the
 
02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
judicial members
 
02:22:59.330 --> 02:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
in child support and other people the
 
02:23:02.450 --> 02:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
same thing with um with child support I
 
02:23:04.190 --> 02:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
was on two of those representative to
 
02:23:05.690 --> 02:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
the point and then stopped please we
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
went around well I'm what I'm doing is
 
02:23:10.969 --> 02:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I would welcome some positive
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
input because I think we need that kind
 
02:23:15.410 --> 02:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
of I think we need something to study to
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
look at and understand the system
 
02:23:20.809 --> 02:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
okay well sure no I mean I would be
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%

any members of the committee to to try
 
02:23:30.349 --> 02:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
to you know draft some language that
 
02:23:30.359 --> 02:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
to you know draft some language that
um

02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:32.929 --> 02:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
along the lines of what I said if that
 
02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%

three minutes means 180 seconds and I
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
can shut your mic off and the reason for
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
that is there's a lot of cards here
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I will say it is three minutes be
 
02:23:58.969 --> 02:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
careful about always be careful about

as a representative Lynn pointed out
um

02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:28.330 --> 02:28:28.340 align:start position:0%
the majority of the complaints against
 
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh judges is in the family court I just
 
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
did a quick little research from 2017 to
 
02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:37.370 align:start position:0%
did a quick little research from 2017 to
2021

02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
2021
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
and during that time period
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
from 2017
 
02:28:45.050 --> 02:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh the complaints filed for Family Court
 
02:28:47.570 --> 02:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
judges was about 34 percent of the total
 
02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:48.590 align:start position:0%
judges was about 34 percent of the total
complaints

02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
02:28:52.730 --> 02:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
and as of 2021 that is up to 70 percent
 
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
of the complaints
 
02:28:57.050 --> 02:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
I feel that
 
02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
um this resolution is a necessity
 
02:29:02.809 --> 02:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
because due process
 
02:29:05.290 --> 02:29:05.300 align:start position:0%
stands for fair procedures
 
02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
and part of that is an unbiased Tribunal
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
the right to present evidence and call
 
02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:13.010 align:start position:0%
the right to present evidence and call
witnesses

02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
witnesses
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
and decision based on evidence as well
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
as the requirement of the Tribunal for
 
02:29:20.809 --> 02:29:20.819 align:start position:0%
written finding of facts and rulings of
 
02:29:20.819 --> 02:29:21.530 align:start position:0%
written finding of facts and rulings of
law

02:29:21.530 --> 02:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:29:23.929 --> 02:29:23.939 align:start position:0%
that seems to not be the case in the
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
02:29:27.889 --> 02:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
uh family court cases if you were to
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
Adventure if you were to look at the
 
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
number of appeals that are before The
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
02:29:35.389 --> 02:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
they again would be
 
02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that judges have not
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
fulfilled that requirement for finding a
 
02:29:46.490 --> 02:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
I feel that in my certain case
 
02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:50.750 align:start position:0%
I feel that in my certain case
um

02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:54.530 --> 02:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
when my case started I had
 
02:29:57.530 --> 02:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
had to file a motion for emergency order
 
02:30:00.170 --> 02:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
to have time with my daughter
 
02:30:02.270 --> 02:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
ended up in a hearing and then two
 
02:30:07.370 --> 02:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
months later we were in another hearing
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
for temporary Waters
 
02:30:11.809 --> 02:30:11.819 align:start position:0%
as part of those temporary orders I did
 
02:30:14.929 --> 02:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
not have any increase in time with my
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
daughter with no findings there was no
 
02:30:19.130 --> 02:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
parenting plan
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
provided and these are the type of
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
things that people suffer
 
02:30:26.410 --> 02:30:26.420 align:start position:0%
when there is no
 
02:30:29.090 --> 02:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
accountability you know I believe that
 
02:30:31.010 --> 02:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
this country again was built on checks
 
02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
and balances it's obvious that
 
02:30:34.439 --> 02:30:35.929 align:start position:0%
and balances it's obvious that
um

02:30:35.929 --> 02:30:35.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
you folks have the ability to you know
 
02:30:43.130 --> 02:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
do that and with this house resolution
 
02:30:44.929 --> 02:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
and I feel that that
 
02:30:47.450 --> 02:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
is a necessary thing based on the
 
02:30:49.849 --> 02:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
testimony you hear on a regular basis as
 
02:30:52.490 --> 02:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
well as the number of accounts and
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
appeals that are filed in regarding the
 
02:30:56.210 --> 02:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
family court
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and under time and on
 
02:31:02.270 --> 02:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
point any questions
 
02:31:05.210 --> 02:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and the chair
 
02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.809 --> 02:31:14.819 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
 
02:31:16.610 --> 02:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
committee representative hole
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of Dunbarton
 
02:31:20.330 --> 02:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
hooks at Allenstown and epsom here to
 
02:31:22.490 --> 02:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of the bill
 
02:31:23.929 --> 02:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
um and I want to start off real quickly
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
there is something called confirmation
 
02:31:29.210 --> 02:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
bias you see what you want to see right
 
02:31:31.130 --> 02:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
and there are those who think the
 
02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
judicial system is broken they'll see it
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
that way for those who think it works
 
02:31:36.889 --> 02:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
they'll see it that way and I think we
 
02:31:38.809 --> 02:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
should take all testimony
 
02:31:42.530 --> 02:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
right in in light of that your task as a
 
02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
committee is to look where are the facts
 
02:31:46.790 --> 02:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
um for the record I'm going to talk
 
02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
about my personal case we won the case I
 
02:31:50.809 --> 02:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
think the representative from Windham
 
02:31:53.809 --> 02:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
made my case made the case for passing
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
this house resolution
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
because he talks about we should go look
 
02:31:59.570 --> 02:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
at transcripts I want to talk about
 
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
transcripts I want to talk about things
 
02:32:03.290 --> 02:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
you guys can't see because of the
 
02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
confidentiality nature of many of these
 
02:32:07.849 --> 02:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
cases dcyf cases are confidential in
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
nature and the transcripts can't just be
 
02:32:11.090 --> 02:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
read by anybody
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
at risk I'm willing to read some of the
 
02:32:15.230 --> 02:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
transcripts from my keys because I think
 
02:32:18.410 --> 02:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's important and I will summarize with
 
02:32:20.570 --> 02:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
the outcome at the adjudicatory hearing
 
02:32:21.889 --> 02:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
during the hearing the overwhelming
 
02:32:23.690 --> 02:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
credible evidence demonstrated that this
 
02:32:26.450 --> 02:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
statement meaning that I was neglecting
 
02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
my children had no Medical Foundation
 
02:32:30.050 --> 02:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
the credible evidence also reflected
 
02:32:32.210 --> 02:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
that the parents had not neglected one
 
02:32:34.969 --> 02:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
of my children redacted in any way and
 
02:32:36.590 --> 02:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
was certainly not in a manner alleged by
 
02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
dcyf that was the final outcome
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start back at the beginning
 
02:32:43.849 --> 02:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
why the process is broken in the first
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
order after the ex parte order an order
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
that I was not present because it was an
 
02:32:49.309 --> 02:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
ex party order could we actually present
 
02:32:50.570 --> 02:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
any evidence
 
02:32:53.210 --> 02:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
there was an initial hearing father
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
agrees to sorry
 
02:32:58.849 --> 02:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
the scheduling of said hearing shall
 
02:33:02.270 --> 02:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
account for the availability of the
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
father's medical Witnesses all of whom
 
02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
shall be able to testify telephonically
 
02:33:09.230 --> 02:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
that is the judge's order at the first
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
hearing that is December 16th understand
 
02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
the start of December 8th fast forward
 
02:33:17.690 --> 02:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
to January 21st we have a status hearing
 
02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:19.610 align:start position:0%
to January 21st we have a status hearing
okay

02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I want to read another line each side
 
02:33:23.210 --> 02:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
will have one and a half hours to
 
02:33:24.349 --> 02:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
present the case including
 
02:33:24.359 --> 02:33:26.389 align:start position:0%
present the case including
cross-examination

02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
cross-examination
 
02:33:26.399 --> 02:33:28.070 align:start position:0%
cross-examination
um

02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:30.170 --> 02:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
the case will be scheduled for three
 
02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
hours at preliminary hearing which will
 
02:33:33.290 --> 02:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
proceed by offers of proof and
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
cross-examination of the pro offered
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
Witnesses okay I'm so still allowed to
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
have my Witnesses
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
guess what we get to the hearing where
 
02:33:44.690 --> 02:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
this takes place
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
and the judge makes a decision on page
 
02:33:51.530 --> 02:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
83 in this that basically says I've made
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
up my mind
 
02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
one of my attorneys the attorney for my
 
02:33:57.170 --> 02:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
son objects and I want to quote his
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
objection because it's so clear
 
02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.610 align:start position:0%
objection because it's so clear
um

02:34:01.610 --> 02:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:04.490 --> 02:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
that there was no evidence presented
 
02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
from our side during the preliminary
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
hearing because he did not allow the
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
medical doctor
 
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
the emergency room doctor I was paying
 
02:34:14.570 --> 02:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
to sit in the hallway at the Concord
 
02:34:16.969 --> 02:34:16.979 align:start position:0%
Court a chance to testify over a
 
02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
three-hour window although his first
 
02:34:20.270 --> 02:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
order said he could be allowed to
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
testify telephonically
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
I have a problem with that the system is
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
broken 15 seconds
 
02:34:28.969 --> 02:34:28.979 align:start position:0%
um I would encourage you to pass this
 
02:34:31.010 --> 02:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
bill you never find a problem if you
 
02:34:32.929 --> 02:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
don't look for it there is clearly
 
02:34:34.490 --> 02:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
something that is aggravating a bunch of
 
02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
families at least be willing to look
 
02:34:38.450 --> 02:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
under the cover of what's going on with
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
that I'll close my testimony thank you
 
02:34:42.290 --> 02:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
representative any questions for the
 
02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:44.270 align:start position:0%
representative any questions for the
representative

02:34:44.270 --> 02:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir Ed Bryans is
 
02:34:49.490 --> 02:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
called up next
 
02:35:01.130 --> 02:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
hello uh Representatives my name is Ed
 
02:35:05.809 --> 02:35:05.819 align:start position:0%
Bryant um I've been coming up here for
 
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
almost a decade uh frankly 10 years ago
 
02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
went through a family court matter
 
02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:12.170 align:start position:0%
went through a family court matter
myself

02:35:12.170 --> 02:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:13.190 align:start position:0%
myself
um

02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
I stand with this bill I believe there
 
02:35:18.349 --> 02:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
needs to be some attention paid to
 
02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the family courts
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
um I see it as a few things I believe
 
02:35:25.969 --> 02:35:25.979 align:start position:0%
the judicial discretion needs to be
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
tightened uh the low level of evidence
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
needed uh in Family Court matters um I
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're at a clear and
 
02:35:34.730 --> 02:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
convincing or preponderance level but
 
02:35:36.530 --> 02:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a level of evidence
 
02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
because in my experience it's based on
 
02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:40.690 align:start position:0%
because in my experience it's based on
hearsay

02:35:40.690 --> 02:35:40.700 align:start position:0%
hearsay
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
my situation we had an ex parte motion
 
02:35:46.610 --> 02:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
filed basically claiming that I was a
 
02:35:49.309 --> 02:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
flight risk my daughter was pulled from
 
02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
me on her birthday with my last words to
 
02:35:56.270 --> 02:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
her being cake friends and presents the
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
claim was made that I was a Flight Risk
 
02:36:02.809 --> 02:36:02.819 align:start position:0%
22 months later in my court hearing
 
02:36:03.950 --> 02:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
after three administrative
 
02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
administrative continuances there was a
 
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
Facebook message to my father who was
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with stage four cancer I had
 
02:36:13.370 --> 02:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
told him dad I'd love to come see you
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'd love for you to meet your grandchild
 
02:36:17.809 --> 02:36:17.819 align:start position:0%
that made me a flight risk
 
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
at the point where I did get my day in
 
02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:21.050 align:start position:0%
at the point where I did get my day in
court

02:36:21.050 --> 02:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
um the guardian litem was completely
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
against me her recommendations to the
 
02:36:29.090 --> 02:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
court were that I have one day a year
 
02:36:31.250 --> 02:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
with my daughter on Father's Day and it
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
would alternate on Christmas on even
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
years the attorney for my ex
 
02:36:40.429 --> 02:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
um had offered me every other weekend
 
02:36:42.889 --> 02:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
with my daughter and Wednesday dinner
 
02:36:44.270 --> 02:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
visits which I believe is pretty
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
standard with a lot of court orders the
 
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
odd thing is as I pointed out to them
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
being a pro se lit again with no legal
 
02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:53.870 align:start position:0%
being a pro se lit again with no legal
experience

02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:36:55.849 --> 02:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
it seemed a little hypocritical to me
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
that they claim I'm a Flight Risk and
 
02:36:59.690 --> 02:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
keep my daughter from me for almost two
 
02:37:01.550 --> 02:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
years but yet they're offering me every
 
02:37:03.170 --> 02:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
other weekend
 
02:37:05.450 --> 02:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
I could be anywhere in the world in 48
 
02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:07.330 align:start position:0%
I could be anywhere in the world in 48
hours

02:37:07.330 --> 02:37:07.340 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:37:09.650 --> 02:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
my my feelings are at the end of my
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
court case whenever the the guardian
 
02:37:15.530 --> 02:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
litem would file for a fee increase
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
I would respond with the motion saying
 
02:37:20.210 --> 02:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
your honor deny her fee increase in fact
 
02:37:23.389 --> 02:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
charge her for theft of services
 
02:37:24.830 --> 02:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
for the money she's already received
 
02:37:27.050 --> 02:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
that she's not doing anything at the end
 
02:37:29.929 --> 02:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
of my court case I walked out with 50 50
 
02:37:29.939 --> 02:37:31.429 align:start position:0%
of my court case I walked out with 50 50
custody

02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
custody
 
02:37:33.889 --> 02:37:33.899 align:start position:0%
the guardian items fee increases were
 
02:37:33.899 --> 02:37:34.910 align:start position:0%
the guardian items fee increases were
denied

02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
denied
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
and for 10 years I've been co-parenting
 
02:37:40.090 --> 02:37:40.100 align:start position:0%
with my ex-wife
 
02:37:42.530 --> 02:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
my daughter is the captain of the
 
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
basketball team she ran for and was
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
elected School president she benefits
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
from having both of her loving parents
 
02:37:49.969 --> 02:37:49.979 align:start position:0%
in her life
 
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't have taken two years to get
 
02:37:54.290 --> 02:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
to that point and during that time I
 
02:37:56.530 --> 02:37:56.540 align:start position:0%
can't get that time back
 
02:37:59.330 --> 02:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
I know later on we have a hearing on a
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
shared parenting bill but I fully
 
02:38:04.730 --> 02:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
believe that the court system needs to
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
be looked at between the guardian items
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
that have quasi-judicial immunity to
 
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
where they're immune to any perjury or
 
02:38:16.370 --> 02:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
false swearing there's other situations
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
with some of the domestic violence
 
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
coalitions that pick and choose their
 
02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:23.030 align:start position:0%

02:38:34.490 --> 02:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
to investigate because all the visits

so there's a lot of problems I sit here
 
02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
today I benefit in no way from any

I'll just hold up a card that means 15
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%

thank you to all your members for your
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
time on this because this is this is a
 
02:40:02.330 --> 02:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
serious situation
 
02:40:04.130 --> 02:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
I come before you today to speak about
 
02:40:05.630 --> 02:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
my experience in the New Hampshire
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
family court and problems surrounding
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%

02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
while applicable you're not going to
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
hear me talk about the sociology

psychology criminology or culture
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
aspects of the harm
 
02:40:20.330 --> 02:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
and with respect I'm going to talk about
 
02:40:22.490 --> 02:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
my experience about the problematic
 
02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:25.859 align:start position:0%

02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
structured abuse and financial rewards
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
during my case
 
02:40:35.929 --> 02:40:35.939 align:start position:0%
divorce decrees are designed to be final
 
02:40:38.929 --> 02:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
perhaps on occasion a modification
 
02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
however 10 years of post-divorce court
 
02:40:43.969 --> 02:40:43.979 align:start position:0%
is not modification
 
02:40:46.130 --> 02:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
and Maya children appeared to be the
 
02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:47.150 align:start position:0%

02:40:55.849 --> 02:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
no due process
 
02:40:59.270 --> 02:40:59.280 align:start position:0%

rules and failure to enforce statute
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
the patterns I'm going to talk about
 
02:41:16.610 --> 02:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
number one is Rule 2.2
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
The Rules of Evidence do not apply
 
02:41:23.090 --> 02:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
pattern two the money flow emerged
 
02:41:25.730 --> 02:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
went from unnecessary gal billing to
 
02:41:27.410 --> 02:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
unnecessary therapist billing and
 
02:41:29.450 --> 02:41:29.460 align:start position:0%

02:41:34.849 --> 02:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
calculations as referred to in RSA 491-a
 
02:41:37.370 --> 02:41:37.380 align:start position:0%

02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:38.330 align:start position:0%

02:41:38.330 --> 02:41:38.340 align:start position:0%

services
 
02:41:44.990 --> 02:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
a Hallmark of my case is the pattern of
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
judicial decisions and predictable
 
02:41:49.730 --> 02:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
orders promoting more and more hearings
 
02:41:53.330 --> 02:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
without relief or resolution
 
02:41:56.929 --> 02:41:56.939 align:start position:0%
the pattern Fosters conflict order show
 
02:41:59.750 --> 02:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
no concern for myself or my children or
 
02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
the regard of our basic needs or
 
02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:03.469 align:start position:0%
the regard of our basic needs or
well-being

02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
pattern four statute and deadlines
 
02:42:09.410 --> 02:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
seemed irrelevant written orders would
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
name people without proper service
 
02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:14.450 align:start position:0%
name people without proper service
notification

02:42:14.450 --> 02:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
notification
 
02:42:16.849 --> 02:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
the protracted case methodology allowing
 
02:42:19.010 --> 02:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
perjury over evidence appears to suggest
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rule 2.2 is the foundation
 
02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
of legal workarounds weaponizing the
 
02:42:25.140 --> 02:42:26.510 align:start position:0%
of legal workarounds weaponizing the
court

02:42:26.510 --> 02:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
I would refer you to the document
 
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi gave you by
 
02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester attorney Shawna Brown
 
02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is was written for uh the bar
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
article called the truth the whole truth
 
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
or something like the truth in this she
 
02:42:43.849 --> 02:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
clearly understands the perjury and
 
02:42:45.170 --> 02:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
family court
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
pattern 5 encompasses a business model
 
02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
the court model emphasizes creating a
 
02:42:53.270 --> 02:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
post-divorce issue where there is none
 
02:42:55.610 --> 02:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
and protracting the case
 
02:42:57.889 --> 02:42:57.899 align:start position:0%
reasons suggests this court model cannot
 
02:43:00.410 --> 02:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
exist alone as independent on pattern
 
02:43:04.190 --> 02:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
six private contractor associations
 
02:43:06.290 --> 02:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
which would include the GL therapists
 
02:43:09.650 --> 02:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
and firms that do that do specialize in
 
02:43:11.750 --> 02:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
divorce services
 
02:43:15.710 --> 02:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
pattern 7 transcripts that did not align
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
with what actually happened in the court
 
02:43:20.809 --> 02:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
it is not that the script
 
02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
is necessarily wrong it's what's missing
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
from it
 
02:43:27.770 --> 02:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
which is typically aligned to judicial
 
02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:29.990 align:start position:0%
which is typically aligned to judicial
behaviors

02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
02:43:32.270 --> 02:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
upon transcript review alterations
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
appear to occur in real time recording
 
02:43:36.110 --> 02:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
control and altered transcripts was
 
02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
always a topic
 
02:43:41.090 --> 02:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
this committee heard testimony about in
 
02:43:43.490 --> 02:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
2022 and 2023
 
02:43:45.469 --> 02:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
and I noted
 
02:43:48.349 --> 02:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
last month we were all in this room
 
02:43:50.990 --> 02:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
January 17 2023
 
02:43:52.849 --> 02:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
and we are in attendance when we heard
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
Mr head testify to convey that judges do
 
02:43:58.370 --> 02:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
not control the recordings there's no
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
foot pedal control in reference to any
 
02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:01.849 align:start position:0%
foot pedal control in reference to any
equipment

02:44:01.849 --> 02:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:44:03.530 --> 02:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
but he mentioned there was a button
 
02:44:05.270 --> 02:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
under the desk
 
02:44:09.230 --> 02:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
and with respect I find this is notable
 
02:44:15.170 --> 02:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
because in January 16th in 2022
 
02:44:17.690 --> 02:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
at hearings on this very issue Richard
 
02:44:21.050 --> 02:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
head gave testimony to approximately 448
 
02:44:23.150 --> 02:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
to 449
 
02:44:25.250 --> 02:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
stating and I quote
 
02:44:28.849 --> 02:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
some of that has occurred he further
 
02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
stated I quote the judges are
 
02:44:34.010 --> 02:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
responsible for the recording
 
02:44:36.410 --> 02:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
he continued explaining that the budget
 
02:44:38.990 --> 02:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
cuts was the reason for court equipment
 
02:44:41.389 --> 02:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
in the control of judges
 
02:44:45.410 --> 02:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
this year on January 17 2023 I spoke
 
02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
about the prolific churning and
 
02:44:49.010 --> 02:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
protraction of cases
 
02:44:51.889 --> 02:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
I found Mr head's testimony notable
 
02:44:54.889 --> 02:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
Mr had explained to all of us that we
 
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
need to understand that someone in the
 
02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
courtroom for 30 minutes hearing has 20
 
02:45:01.969 --> 02:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
more people behind them
 
02:45:03.950 --> 02:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
I interpret that this does not address
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
protraction issue but in fact confirms
 
02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:08.210 align:start position:0%
protraction issue but in fact confirms
protraction

02:45:08.210 --> 02:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
protraction
 
02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
and I will conclude with a summary
 
02:45:12.849 --> 02:45:12.859 align:start position:0%
failure and I totally apologize for this
 
02:45:16.370 --> 02:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
ultimately what you guys do is important

on the last paragraph of your uh page on
 
02:45:49.370 --> 02:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
the last parent and the first page you
 
02:45:52.490 --> 02:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
say pattern four uh statute and
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
deadlines seem irrelevant
 
02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
what is the recourse for that problem
 
02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:59.389 align:start position:0%
what is the recourse for that problem
occurring

02:45:59.389 --> 02:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
I think you have to enforce it was that
 
02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
I think you have to enforce it you have
 
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
to enforce statute
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
like for instance the example I wrote in
 
02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
there so that I could limit this was
 
02:46:11.929 --> 02:46:11.939 align:start position:0%
talking about written or I would get
 
02:46:13.610 --> 02:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
written orders
 
02:46:16.849 --> 02:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
with people named in it who were never
 
02:46:16.859 --> 02:46:18.469 align:start position:0%

given

02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
given
 
02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
any kind of service notification as
 
02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
required they couldn't show up at Court
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't know about court but here
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
they are named in these orders
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
well how are they supposed to be there
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
to talk oh do you see what I'm saying
 
02:46:33.290 --> 02:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
there's the statute wasn't enforced that
 
02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
they have to give proper service okay
 
02:46:36.110 --> 02:46:36.120 align:start position:0%

okay
 
02:47:13.969 --> 02:47:13.979 align:start position:0%
um so the little bit of history of my
 
02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
family case a couple years ago when the
 
02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
petition first went in uh visitation was
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
withheld I submitted a ex parte motion
 
02:47:26.929 --> 02:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
uh which the other side had an attorney
 
02:47:28.730 --> 02:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
and I didn't
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
um in both the uh the judge and the
 
02:47:34.610 --> 02:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
attorney had requested that there was
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
two motions to be denied
 
02:47:40.370 --> 02:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
um that brought us to a temporary
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
hearing where the my rights to my son
 
02:47:45.650 --> 02:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
were already starting to be taken away
 
02:47:47.530 --> 02:47:47.540 align:start position:0%
on on allegation
 
02:47:50.330 --> 02:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
and so when I found out there was a
 
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest with the attorney
 
02:47:53.929 --> 02:47:53.939 align:start position:0%
and the judge I had asked him to accuse
 
02:47:53.939 --> 02:47:55.190 align:start position:0%
and the judge I had asked him to accuse
himself

02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
himself
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm only here today uh
 
02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
because I waived my due process rights
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
to to be heard by a jury
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
and I withdrew my appeal
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
I just finished serving 60 days Carroll
 
02:48:11.150 --> 02:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
County House of Corrections
 
02:48:14.090 --> 02:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh it was a full sentence uh judge
 
02:48:16.969 --> 02:48:16.979 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse sentenced me on a bench trial
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
or allegedly sending a non-threatening
 
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
text message about parenting my 10 year
 
02:48:23.389 --> 02:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
old son to his mother
 
02:48:25.610 --> 02:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
after judge green I'll issue an order
 
02:48:29.450 --> 02:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
restraining me from no contact I was
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
arrested for sending another text
 
02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
message after he accused himself due to
 
02:48:35.270 --> 02:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest
 
02:48:37.610 --> 02:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
but they didn't find uh didn't stop him
 
02:48:40.490 --> 02:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
from uh Finding Me criminally guilty and
 
02:48:43.370 --> 02:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
sentenced to 60 days even after the same
 
02:48:45.650 --> 02:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
complaint was denied by a different
 
02:48:45.660 --> 02:48:47.630 align:start position:0%
complaint was denied by a different
judge

02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
judge
 
02:48:49.490 --> 02:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
when I tried to appeal to Superior Court
 
02:48:51.410 --> 02:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
for de novo
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh the judge ordered me reincarcerated
 
02:48:56.090 --> 02:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh preventative detention until I Was
 
02:48:59.330 --> 02:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:01.849 --> 02:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
for the same text message I withdrew my
 
02:49:04.250 --> 02:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
appeal and my right to a jury so I could
 
02:49:05.770 --> 02:49:05.780 align:start position:0%
be released
 
02:49:08.450 --> 02:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
to spend time with my son because he
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand why the Court's doing
 
02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:12.770 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand why the Court's doing
this

02:49:12.770 --> 02:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:14.690 align:start position:0%
this
so

02:49:14.690 --> 02:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
if a family court judge doesn't like you
 
02:49:18.889 --> 02:49:18.899 align:start position:0%
they can lock you up throw away the key
 
02:49:21.290 --> 02:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
and if you stand up to them
 
02:49:23.090 --> 02:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
for no other reason than trying to
 
02:49:23.100 --> 02:49:23.990 align:start position:0%
for no other reason than trying to
parent

02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
parent
 
02:49:25.730 --> 02:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
or trying to assert your constitutional
 
02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:28.910 align:start position:0%
or trying to assert your constitutional
rights

02:49:28.910 --> 02:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
I urge you uh as far as the subpoena
 
02:49:34.130 --> 02:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
goes I would like to have some of my
 
02:49:35.630 --> 02:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
questions answered
 
02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
and uh as far as an investigation
 
02:49:42.410 --> 02:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
I do disagree with one side prevailing
 
02:49:44.090 --> 02:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be in competition for our
 
02:49:46.990 --> 02:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
children for 15 seconds
 
02:49:49.610 --> 02:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
and so if anyone has any questions I'll
 
02:49:53.450 --> 02:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:56.270 --> 02:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
about what happened to my family seeing
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
none thank you so much appreciate your
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair now recognizes Dana
 
02:50:00.479 --> 02:50:12.410 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair now recognizes Dana
Albrecht

02:50:12.410 --> 02:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:15.290 --> 02:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman for the
 
02:50:17.090 --> 02:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
record my name is Dana Albrecht from
 
02:50:19.070 --> 02:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
Nashua many of you have heard me before
 
02:50:21.530 --> 02:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna joke I'd like several hours
 
02:50:24.050 --> 02:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
but we don't have several hours and
 
02:50:26.690 --> 02:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
that's precisely the point of why we
 
02:50:28.610 --> 02:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
need an investigation to look into this
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
more fully what we do have is countless
 
02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
victims of the circuit court system
 
02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's currently presided over by chief
 
02:50:39.650 --> 02:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
administrative Judge David King
 
02:50:41.630 --> 02:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
and all those victims including myself
 
02:50:44.210 --> 02:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
deserve a full investigation and some
 
02:50:46.490 --> 02:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
method of redress
 
02:50:48.650 --> 02:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh to address some of the things the
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative from Wyndham said I would
 
02:50:53.210 --> 02:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you all to look at the
 
02:50:55.309 --> 02:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
handout I said around it's only three
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
pages what you've got there is an email
 
02:51:01.849 --> 02:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
from Judge King about the misconduct
 
02:51:04.849 --> 02:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
uh and what you've got after that is
 
02:51:07.250 --> 02:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
what the JCC did about it which was to
 
02:51:10.610 --> 02:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:10.620 --> 02:51:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
even now the New Hampshire judicial
 
02:51:17.330 --> 02:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
branch refuses to release the complete
 
02:51:21.050 --> 02:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
and unredacted deposition of Judge King
 
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
related to their own internal
 
02:51:26.570 --> 02:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
investigation of that and again to
 
02:51:28.190 --> 02:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
address what the representative from
 
02:51:30.650 --> 02:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
Windham said about order the transcripts
 
02:51:33.230 --> 02:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great idea how do we
 
02:51:35.450 --> 02:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
order the transcript of Judge King's
 
02:51:35.460 --> 02:51:36.710 align:start position:0%
order the transcript of Judge King's
deposition

02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
deposition
 
02:51:39.650 --> 02:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
and that's why the subpoena power of
 
02:51:44.270 --> 02:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is so important because in a
 
02:51:45.889 --> 02:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
family law case where there's proven
 
02:51:49.130 --> 02:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
misconduct shouldn't it at least the
 
02:51:51.530 --> 02:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee or the
 
02:51:54.170 --> 02:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary Committee be able to get
 
02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
a the deposition of the chief
 
02:51:58.849 --> 02:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
administrative judge directly relating
 
02:52:01.610 --> 02:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
to that misconduct and see what they
 
02:52:03.170 --> 02:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
02:52:05.570 --> 02:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
and um

Okay Lori ortolano I live in Nashua I've
 
02:56:25.130 --> 02:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
never been involved in family court so
 
02:56:27.410 --> 02:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking as an outsider but I'm
 
02:56:29.330 --> 02:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
speaking as an outsider that has some
 
02:56:32.269 --> 02:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what some of my friends and
 
02:56:34.250 --> 02:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
my sister-in-law went through and with
 
02:56:36.650 --> 02:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
their encounter in Family Court I think
 
02:56:38.929 --> 02:56:38.939 align:start position:0%
that if we peel away you know any
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
language that involves corrupt judges
 
02:56:42.889 --> 02:56:42.899 align:start position:0%
because it's an uncomfortable place to
 
02:56:45.710 --> 02:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
go and we just focus on process there is
 
02:56:47.929 --> 02:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
plenty here to look at to look at
 
02:56:50.809 --> 02:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
process Improvement and I think it's
 
02:56:52.690 --> 02:56:52.700 align:start position:0%
very important we do that
 
02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know these are very emotionally
 
02:56:57.469 --> 02:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
charged cases and family court is where
 
02:56:59.150 --> 02:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the highest level of
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
emotionally charged cases but we have to
 
02:57:03.290 --> 02:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
be careful that we're not dismissing
 
02:57:05.990 --> 02:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
these complaints and allowing potential
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
bad conduct to exist in plain sight
 
02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
because they are emotionally charged
 
02:57:13.370 --> 02:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
cases we have to look and we have to be
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
attentive to that court rules super
 
02:57:18.170 --> 02:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
important and I think you have a great
 
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to understand the rules and
 
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
gather data my sister-in-law was
 
02:57:24.650 --> 02:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
involved in gaining custody of two young
 
02:57:26.929 --> 02:57:26.939 align:start position:0%
children through that anise had in
 
02:57:28.730 --> 02:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
providing support she lives in
 
02:57:30.889 --> 02:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts she's been a psych nurse
 
02:57:33.050 --> 02:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
for 40 years she's been involved with
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
child issues and guardian ad litem
 
02:57:37.070 --> 02:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
issues in Massachusetts her statement to
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
me is why doesn't New Hampshire try to
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
improve the system and operate a little
 
02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
more efficiently like Massachusetts does
 
02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
because after spending thirty thousand
 
02:57:48.650 --> 02:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
dollars trying to assist these kids she
 
02:57:50.389 --> 02:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to pull her hair out and they're
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
raising these two young children she's
 
02:57:55.309 --> 02:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
65 and her husband is 70. it's a huge
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
commitment and she has a very loving
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
heart she's all about the kids she's
 
02:58:02.690 --> 02:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
worked with children her own whole life
 
02:58:04.730 --> 02:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
so I think there's an opportunity with a
 
02:58:06.650 --> 02:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
neighboring state to look at process
 
02:58:08.170 --> 02:58:08.180 align:start position:0%
down there as well
 
02:58:11.150 --> 02:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
deadlines very important the judicial
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
system as a whole does not acknowledge
 
02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's no regulations or laws that
 
02:58:18.230 --> 02:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
mandate when orders have to be issued
 
02:58:21.230 --> 02:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
and The Honorable representative from
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
Windham mentioned that you know a lot of
 
02:58:24.650 --> 02:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
complaints get filed by people who lose
 
02:58:27.590 --> 02:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
I just filed The JCC complaint on a case
 
02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
I won and I have a call at one o'clock
 
02:58:33.410 --> 02:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
with an AOC director to address a
 
02:58:36.230 --> 02:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
clerking issue in the court I won but
 
02:58:37.849 --> 02:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
I'm complaining because I thought the
 
02:58:40.670 --> 02:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
process was completely wrong and it took
 
02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
seven months to get something that
 
02:58:44.330 --> 02:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
should have taken 30 days so I'm
 
02:58:46.010 --> 02:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to what these parents are
 
02:58:48.769 --> 02:58:48.779 align:start position:0%
saying and I see children and families
 
02:58:50.710 --> 02:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
that are going six eight and ten years
 
02:58:53.630 --> 02:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
waiting for orders and parenting plans
 
02:58:56.330 --> 02:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
to be determined it's too long it's too
 
02:58:58.010 --> 02:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
painful and there's too much trauma
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
involved in that so these stories could
 
02:59:03.290 --> 02:59:03.300 align:start position:0%
go on a lot longer I can tell and I
 
02:59:04.849 --> 02:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
think it's worth allowing them to be
 
02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
explored and to go on a little longer
 
02:59:08.809 --> 02:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
02:59:10.370 --> 02:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
not going on a little longer I really
 
02:59:12.230 --> 02:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you did there that's
 
02:59:14.690 --> 02:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
good the chair recognizes and I'm trying
 
02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:23.870 --> 02:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's my fault not come on up say it
 
02:59:23.880 --> 02:59:26.750 align:start position:0%
that's my fault not come on up say it
again

02:59:26.750 --> 02:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
where's it from I'm sorry what where's
 
02:59:31.570 --> 02:59:31.580 align:start position:0%
the country it's from uh Canada
 
02:59:37.250 --> 02:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:40.429 --> 02:59:40.439 align:start position:0%
again my name is Michelle lagimonier
 
02:59:41.870 --> 02:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
um it is a bit hard for me to be here
 
02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
today because what I'm going to speak
 
02:59:46.190 --> 02:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
about is is very real and it's happening
 
02:59:49.610 --> 02:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
right now but it's important for me it's
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
important for me to be here
 
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm in favor of HR 14. the failure of
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
due process is very present in my
 
03:00:02.030 --> 03:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
current divorce case
 
03:00:02.040 --> 03:00:02.809 align:start position:0%
current divorce case
um

03:00:02.809 --> 03:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
I am living in a hostile and offensive
 
03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:06.889 align:start position:0%
I am living in a hostile and offensive
environment

03:00:06.889 --> 03:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
environment
 
03:00:10.429 --> 03:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
my mental health has been impacted
 
03:00:12.889 --> 03:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
there is a cycle of violence that was
 
03:00:15.650 --> 03:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
going on in my household
 
03:00:18.790 --> 03:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
I walked on eggshells
 
03:00:22.030 --> 03:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
my husband's language made me feel small
 
03:00:25.849 --> 03:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
inferior and belittled
 
03:00:28.670 --> 03:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
it was to the point of abuse
 
03:00:31.790 --> 03:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
and it was a very volatile and
 
03:00:35.570 --> 03:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
difficult environment in my home
 
03:00:35.580 --> 03:00:36.469 align:start position:0%
difficult environment in my home
um

03:00:36.469 --> 03:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:38.750 --> 03:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
I've currently spent about fifteen
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that I don't have
 
03:00:44.809 --> 03:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
in this divorce case
 
03:00:49.910 --> 03:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
I am trying to get my word out when we
 
03:00:51.410 --> 03:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
have court cases
 
03:00:54.710 --> 03:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
and I haven't been able to speak
 
03:00:57.230 --> 03:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
what I want to be able to say
 
03:00:59.929 --> 03:00:59.939 align:start position:0%
I've had roadblocks put up
 
03:01:02.330 --> 03:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
I've been accused of things that I
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
haven't committed
 
03:01:06.650 --> 03:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to advocate for my
 
03:01:10.010 --> 03:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
daughter who I have concerned about and
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
it just hasn't been able to happen
 
03:01:16.309 --> 03:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
I've been fearful of my husband for
 
03:01:18.230 --> 03:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
quite some time
 
03:01:21.769 --> 03:01:21.779 align:start position:0%
I have used avoidance tactics to stay
 
03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
away from him
 
03:01:26.570 --> 03:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
everything appears in all intensive
 
03:01:31.070 --> 03:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
purposes to look okay but it's not
 
03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:33.110 align:start position:0%
purposes to look okay but it's not
um

03:01:33.110 --> 03:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:34.849 --> 03:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
my husband
 
03:01:39.290 --> 03:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
I believe has a mental health disorder
 
03:01:42.230 --> 03:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
but because I wasn't able to get it in
 
03:01:44.990 --> 03:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
the divorce proceeding at the proper
 
03:01:47.450 --> 03:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
time in the proper order
 
03:01:50.210 --> 03:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
it's not acknowledged
 
03:01:50.220 --> 03:01:51.469 align:start position:0%
it's not acknowledged
um

03:01:51.469 --> 03:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
so again I am here in favor of H.R 14 I
 
03:01:58.250 --> 03:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
do feel it's very important
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you so much thank you
 
03:02:02.330 --> 03:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
for your courage to come before us as
 
03:02:13.070 --> 03:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:14.750 --> 03:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
03:02:17.389 --> 03:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
committee as I had told you guys in the
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
past I have been to the Supreme Court
 
03:02:23.389 --> 03:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
four times actually five appeals four
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
times with the remian coming back to the
 
03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
local courts so I am a winning case
 
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
um I know representative uh Bob Lin said
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
that it's only the people that are
 
03:02:36.170 --> 03:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
complaining that that have lost I am not
 
03:02:38.630 --> 03:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
that person I won every single time for
 
03:02:41.870 --> 03:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
full child support to my children I did
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
have two bad judges I had intercasso and
 
03:02:47.090 --> 03:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
delbro that both showed very much so
 
03:02:49.730 --> 03:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
unethical Behavior I did file JCC
 
03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
reports nothing ever came up at the
 
03:02:51.540 --> 03:02:53.150 align:start position:0%
reports nothing ever came up at the
beginning

03:02:53.150 --> 03:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
03:02:56.809 --> 03:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
um in my case in Picasso did she did not
 
03:02:59.090 --> 03:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
allow evidence to come in or allow
 
03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:00.950 align:start position:0%
allow evidence to come in or allow
motions

03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
motions
 
03:03:02.990 --> 03:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
um to come in late from my ex but I was
 
03:03:06.050 --> 03:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
not able to um go ahead and put in late
 
03:03:08.030 --> 03:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
motions on my side as
 
03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
I needed to I got blindsided I was
 
03:03:13.730 --> 03:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
biased against from these judges I have
 
03:03:15.290 --> 03:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
a 10 inch binder that I did not bring
 
03:03:16.630 --> 03:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
today but I've brought it here before
 
03:03:19.250 --> 03:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
that shows all the judge's discussions
 
03:03:21.410 --> 03:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
on my case
 
03:03:25.010 --> 03:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
the judge allowed evidence there are a
 
03:03:26.690 --> 03:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
lot of evidence when they feel like it
 
03:03:28.670 --> 03:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
or excluded it as they felt it was
 
03:03:31.610 --> 03:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
critical to that case and in many times
 
03:03:34.130 --> 03:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
it actually had led to very profound
 
03:03:37.250 --> 03:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
disadvantages to me and as I had spoke
 
03:03:39.050 --> 03:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
to you guys this morning about the wage
 
03:03:42.290 --> 03:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
assignments that showed many in many
 
03:03:45.290 --> 03:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
cases that the monthly obligation amount
 
03:03:47.450 --> 03:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
should not have changed the only thing
 
03:03:50.210 --> 03:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
that was in dispute was urea's based on
 
03:03:53.450 --> 03:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
all of these um Supreme Court appeals
 
03:03:56.030 --> 03:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
every time something went through the
 
03:03:57.650 --> 03:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
court it took at least six to nine
 
03:04:00.530 --> 03:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
months each time a order went through
 
03:04:03.050 --> 03:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
the court system for one particular
 
03:04:06.950 --> 03:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
order it would take 25 months from the
 
03:04:09.110 --> 03:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
time the order came out to the time it
 
03:04:12.650 --> 03:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
actually went before a judge and and the
 
03:04:14.269 --> 03:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
judge turned around and said no I am
 
03:04:16.550 --> 03:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
staying to this order and those orders
 
03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
were passed out to you this morning
 
03:04:22.130 --> 03:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
so the the timeliness between these
 
03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
events are too damaging to families and
 
03:04:28.250 --> 03:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
the fact that judges are supposed to
 
03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
have 30 days to communicate back to
 
03:04:34.550 --> 03:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
people like me of why it's taken so long
 
03:04:36.349 --> 03:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
and what is causing the problems on
 
03:04:37.550 --> 03:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
these orders
 
03:04:40.670 --> 03:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
and from my understanding in my case the
 
03:04:42.410 --> 03:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
judge is supposed to go to judge king
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
and let them know what has taken so long
 
03:04:47.690 --> 03:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
on these orders granted in my case I
 
03:04:51.050 --> 03:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
have had a long nine-year divorce I've
 
03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
had five appeals for them that got
 
03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
remanded for the judge to turn around
 
03:04:57.410 --> 03:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
and say that I didn't deserve child
 
03:04:59.710 --> 03:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
support for my children 15 seconds
 
03:05:02.690 --> 03:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
absolutely I just think it's a disgrace
 
03:05:04.849 --> 03:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's all feeding into this
 
03:05:08.090 --> 03:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
ecosystem that is provided and and it
 
03:05:10.610 --> 03:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
goes between the schools the judges and
 
03:05:12.349 --> 03:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
everywhere else so I just think that
 
03:05:15.230 --> 03:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
this is a very good bill to support to
 
03:05:17.269 --> 03:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
look into these ecosystems that are
 
03:05:20.389 --> 03:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
being fed by our ATMs May the chair say
 
03:05:23.150 --> 03:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
Well done thank you this was good this
 
03:05:23.160 --> 03:05:24.290 align:start position:0%
Well done thank you this was good this
time

03:05:24.290 --> 03:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:05:27.290 --> 03:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
and rep not representative I wouldn't do
 
03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:38.450 --> 03:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:05:39.889 --> 03:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
03:05:43.730 --> 03:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch I do want to put
 
03:05:45.230 --> 03:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
into context
 
03:05:47.090 --> 03:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
um sort of the
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
um no more pink cards we are closed
 
03:05:51.889 --> 03:05:51.899 align:start position:0%
after this person
 
03:05:54.349 --> 03:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
um what is Family Division so in and I
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
talked about this before but
 
03:05:58.130 --> 03:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a family court per se
 
03:05:59.870 --> 03:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
we have Family Division we have probate
 
03:06:01.969 --> 03:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
Division and we have District division
 
03:06:03.710 --> 03:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
all are part of the court that we're
 
03:06:06.530 --> 03:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
talking about which is circuit court and
 
03:06:08.750 --> 03:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
circuit court judges hear cases in all
 
03:06:10.490 --> 03:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
of those divisions so we don't have
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
judges that just here
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're not just hearing Family Division
 
03:06:17.450 --> 03:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
cases but they're hearing the broad
 
03:06:20.330 --> 03:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
scope of them and within the Circuit
 
03:06:22.670 --> 03:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
Court what we are what we have is about
 
03:06:22.680 --> 03:06:24.349 align:start position:0%
Court what we are what we have is about
127

03:06:24.349 --> 03:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
127
 
03:06:27.170 --> 03:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
000 new cases coming in every year so we
 
03:06:29.210 --> 03:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
have 127
 
03:06:32.090 --> 03:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
000 cases all new coming in each year
 
03:06:35.090 --> 03:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
and to handle that we have 42 full-time
 
03:06:39.550 --> 03:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
judges and six part-time judges it is a
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
overwhelming workload and and sort of my
 
03:06:46.730 --> 03:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
my point of bringing this up is some of
 
03:06:48.650 --> 03:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
the changes that are being implemented
 
03:06:50.690 --> 03:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
currently and what our chief justice is
 
03:06:54.050 --> 03:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
currently doing towards trying to bring
 
03:06:56.929 --> 03:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
some some relief to what is a very
 
03:06:59.929 --> 03:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
stressed system so
 
03:07:02.330 --> 03:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
um within this year's budget from the
 
03:07:05.450 --> 03:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
judicial branch the the chief justice is
 
03:07:08.330 --> 03:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
asking for additional resources in the
 
03:07:09.889 --> 03:07:09.899 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court I'm just going to focus on
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
the circuit court and he's asking that
 
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
we have seven additional judges into the
 
03:07:17.330 --> 03:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
circuit court and and put some numbers
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
to what that means last year or last
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
year we did what's called a weighted
 
03:07:24.530 --> 03:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
caseload study with the national Center
 
03:07:27.769 --> 03:07:27.779 align:start position:0%
of state courts and what they did was
 
03:07:30.290 --> 03:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
evaluate how much time is spent by
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
judges in all of their cases very
 
03:07:33.849 --> 03:07:33.859 align:start position:0%
broadly stated
 
03:07:37.070 --> 03:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
the chief just did this presentation in
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
about two hours I'll do it in another
 
03:07:38.819 --> 03:07:39.910 align:start position:0%
about two hours I'll do it in another
minute

03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
minute
 
03:07:43.250 --> 03:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
and what we know is that the total
 
03:07:45.650 --> 03:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
number of Judges that we have adds up to
 
03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
what's called a session day is the
 
03:07:50.510 --> 03:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
amount of days that a judge can sit and
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
with the judges we currently have we
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
have available
 
03:07:57.050 --> 03:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
249 session days
 
03:07:58.969 --> 03:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry that's for each judge so
 
03:08:02.090 --> 03:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
each judge can do 249 we have a total of
 
03:08:05.450 --> 03:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
about 10 500 session days in our system
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
with our judges so that's sort of the
 
03:08:10.429 --> 03:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
number that we have if you take up the
 
03:08:13.070 --> 03:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
total time that all of those cases take
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
for for those judges
 
03:08:19.250 --> 03:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
of we have 10 500 available
 
03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
it requires sixteen thousand three
 
03:08:23.630 --> 03:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
hundred to get through all those games
 
03:08:25.849 --> 03:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
one minute left thank you
 
03:08:28.849 --> 03:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
um and and what we're doing through the
 
03:08:31.250 --> 03:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
to the chief Justice's budget is adding
 
03:08:33.290 --> 03:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
to our judges so we can add session days
 
03:08:35.870 --> 03:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
so we can bring some relief into the
 
03:08:38.750 --> 03:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
system separately we have similar
 
03:08:41.809 --> 03:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
stresses in the court clerk system we
 
03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
are bringing in and we've asked for and
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
the chief justice has asked for 31
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
additional staff clerks within our court
 
03:08:50.570 --> 03:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
system to help relieve some of the
 
03:08:53.809 --> 03:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
backlog within the clerk system I could
 
03:08:55.910 --> 03:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
go on there's there's simply a great
 
03:08:58.550 --> 03:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
deal of stress in the system and what
 
03:09:01.309 --> 03:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
you hear in what you heard today some of
 
03:09:04.010 --> 03:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
the issues being length of time delay
 
03:09:07.130 --> 03:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
and uh and trying to get cases moved
 
03:09:07.140 --> 03:09:07.969 align:start position:0%
and uh and trying to get cases moved
through

03:09:07.969 --> 03:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:09:11.210 --> 03:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do would as as
 
03:09:13.130 --> 03:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn said essentially
 
03:09:16.190 --> 03:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
recreate what was in 2011 the redress of
 
03:09:18.349 --> 03:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
grievance committee where where
 
03:09:20.570 --> 03:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
individuals can come in talk about their
 
03:09:22.670 --> 03:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
case from a very one-sided perspective
 
03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
this adds into it the ability to issue a
 
03:09:28.370 --> 03:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
subpoena to a judge to come in and talk
 
03:09:30.590 --> 03:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
about case decisions they may even be
 
03:09:33.050 --> 03:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
cases that are live before that judge
 
03:09:35.809 --> 03:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
currently they may be judges or cases
 
03:09:37.490 --> 03:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
that are on appeal they may even be
 
03:09:39.410 --> 03:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
cases where the court is not issued in
 
03:09:42.170 --> 03:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
order yet and come in and have to under
 
03:09:45.769 --> 03:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
oath under a subpoena testify about the
 
03:09:48.230 --> 03:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh about the very cases that they are
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
evaluating and deciding with that I
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
understand my time is up I would be
 
03:09:54.830 --> 03:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions or answer
 
03:09:56.809 --> 03:09:56.819 align:start position:0%
questions on the side if anyone has any
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time seeing no
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
questions this uh closes the hearing on
 
03:10:06.530 --> 03:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
house resolution 14 we will reconvene
 
03:10:10.870 --> 03:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
for an exact session at 120.
 
03:10:16.510 --> 03:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
120 I suggest I have suggested that
 
03:10:19.849 --> 03:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn and whole and
 
03:10:22.969 --> 03:10:22.979 align:start position:0%

03:10:28.969 --> 03:10:28.979 align:start position:0%
come to see where we can pluck out some
 
03:10:32.690 --> 03:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
good stuff of this resolution and take
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
into account the other aspects of it
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we can square the circle not sure
 
03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see if we could try thank
 
03:10:40.200 --> 03:51:42.889 align:start position:0%

the occasional courtesy break that we
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
might meet
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:53:28.849 --> 03:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
open uh opening the executive session on
 
03:53:33.130 --> 03:53:33.140 align:start position:0%

03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
you looking for discussion or are you
 
03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
looking for a motion the chair is going
 
03:53:46.729 --> 03:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:49.370 --> 03:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
and who seconded representative
 
03:53:51.650 --> 03:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
to see you
 
03:53:54.410 --> 03:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
I mean it's not unmice to see the others
 
03:53:57.050 --> 03:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
but you weren't here so
 
03:54:01.130 --> 03:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
so chair moves retain
 
03:54:03.769 --> 03:54:03.779 align:start position:0%
um seconded by representative Moulton
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
we thought that there was some good
 
03:54:16.130 --> 03:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
things in here but it was a little
 
03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
generalized in its language and as we
 
03:54:21.650 --> 03:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
continued to bat it around you may
 
03:54:23.929 --> 03:54:23.939 align:start position:0%
remember we thought that if this bill
 
03:54:26.750 --> 03:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
were retained there could be some good
 
03:54:28.729 --> 03:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
work done on it and it could be brought
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
up in the fall for this work session
 
03:54:34.670 --> 03:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
with then a vote which will send it to

that's found in the upper left corner
 
03:57:46.370 --> 03:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
but is there another amendment that has
 
03:57:49.070 --> 03:57:49.080 align:start position:0%

03:58:13.969 --> 03:58:13.979 align:start position:0%
inadvertently ignored previously what is
 
03:58:15.650 --> 03:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
your motion thank you Mr chairman um Mr
 
03:58:18.170 --> 03:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
chairman I would wish to move uh House
 
03:58:21.250 --> 03:58:21.260 align:start position:0%

03:58:27.650 --> 03:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
0611h the motion is move House Bill 535
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.610 --> 03:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
but he didn't say it she didn't
 
03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
you didn't I guess I did not uh to pass
 
03:58:51.290 --> 03:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
would you like to I would I thought so
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:58.070 --> 03:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
it would be an otpa now let's take a
 
03:59:02.210 --> 03:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.610 --> 03:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
remember we had numbers of questions
 
03:59:07.550 --> 03:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
that came up and
 
03:59:12.170 --> 03:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
I assume that representative hole has
 
03:59:29.210 --> 03:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:30.889 --> 03:59:30.899 align:start position:0%
let's take let's take a minute and read
 
04:00:13.010 --> 04:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.020 --> 04:02:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um so I have some issues with
 
04:02:13.670 --> 04:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:02:13.680 --> 04:02:16.130 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

04:02:16.130 --> 04:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
the the original Bill I'm not talking
 
04:02:22.510 --> 04:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
quite about the amendment yet doesn't
 
04:02:24.530 --> 04:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily say that the child's
 
04:02:27.229 --> 04:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
expressed interests
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
um are in
 
04:02:33.110 --> 04:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
where so if the if the child's expressed
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
in interest conflict with the
 
04:02:37.130 --> 04:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the guardian ad
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
litem but my issue with that is that
 
04:02:42.170 --> 04:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes kids don't know what's in
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
their best interest
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
so which is why they need adults to make
 
04:02:47.809 --> 04:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
decisions for them
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
um if they could always make the right
 
04:02:50.809 --> 04:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
decision then they wouldn't really need
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
parents and in in this case they
 
04:02:55.010 --> 04:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need parents for money
 
04:02:55.020 --> 04:02:56.750 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need parents for money
well

04:02:56.750 --> 04:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
for example if I can use my teenager for
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
a for an example that you know if he uh
 
04:03:10.250 --> 04:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
if he you know made a mess and so I any
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
and he didn't clean it up and I gave him
 
04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
till a certain time frame to to clean it
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
up and he didn't and so I you know
 
04:03:18.889 --> 04:03:18.899 align:start position:0%
turned off his cell phone for the
 
04:03:20.929 --> 04:03:20.939 align:start position:0%
weekend or something like that he that
 
04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
might that's a most people would say
 
04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriate punishment but
 
04:03:26.809 --> 04:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
that would be against the child's
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
expressed interests and so because he
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
would want to keep his phone but also
 
04:03:32.689 --> 04:03:32.699 align:start position:0%
not have to clean up a mess because he's
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
a teenager so
 
04:03:37.610 --> 04:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
um so my issue is that
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes child children you know
 
04:03:42.170 --> 04:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it would be
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for an attorney to get
 
04:03:46.070 --> 04:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
involved just because a child's
 
04:03:49.010 --> 04:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
expressed interest is in conflict with a
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem I think I think
 
04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
there that opens up a can of worms
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
I wonder if lines 2234 help us that the
 
04:04:02.570 --> 04:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
the child can wave that off in other
 
04:04:05.349 --> 04:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
words the child could fire the attorney
 
04:04:09.290 --> 04:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
If the child wanted to it's not demanded
 
04:04:11.450 --> 04:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's not it's just giving the child
 
04:04:14.330 --> 04:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
another resource the council would
 
04:04:14.340 --> 04:04:15.429 align:start position:0%
another resource the council would
counsel

04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
04:04:19.969 --> 04:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.530 --> 04:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:04:24.530 --> 04:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
04:04:26.830 --> 04:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
04:04:28.969 --> 04:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
04:04:30.769 --> 04:04:30.779 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
um and thank you to representative hole
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
um who has put quite a bit of work into
 
04:04:35.399 --> 04:04:36.889 align:start position:0%
um who has put quite a bit of work into
this

04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
um making the amendment and bringing it
 
04:04:41.689 --> 04:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
back to us I I see a lot of the things
 
04:04:44.090 --> 04:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
that we had discussed in this amendment
 
04:04:46.429 --> 04:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate that
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
um I also see some of the concerns that
 
04:04:51.170 --> 04:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
Casa had are addressed by this amendment
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
as well and I appreciate that I'd just
 
04:04:56.030 --> 04:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
like to highlight there are some
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
significant changes in this amendment
 
04:05:03.050 --> 04:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
from the original Bill some of which I
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
think are really great and others I'm
 
04:05:08.689 --> 04:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
still concerned about the language so
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
under line 9 2A it says the court shall
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
appoint an attorney to represent an
 
04:05:18.290 --> 04:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
Indigent parent alleged neglect or abuse
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
his child I cannot express my support to
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
that enough I worked for dcif back in
 
04:05:26.510 --> 04:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
those years when parents didn't have
 
04:05:28.250 --> 04:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
attorneys there was like two years or
 
04:05:29.929 --> 04:05:29.939 align:start position:0%
they weren't being appointed attorneys
 
04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
and it was terrible everyone deserves to
 
04:05:32.160 --> 04:05:33.010 align:start position:0%
and it was terrible everyone deserves to
have

04:05:33.010 --> 04:05:33.020 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
an attorney giving them advice so I
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
agree with that completely B online 16
 
04:05:40.610 --> 04:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
is great
 
04:05:43.969 --> 04:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
um C it says on the date of a point of
 
04:05:46.370 --> 04:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
filing the court shall appoint an
 
04:05:47.809 --> 04:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
attorney to represent the child's
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
expressed interest for children 12 years
 
04:05:52.610 --> 04:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
or older I appreciate that there was an
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
effort made not to give you know six
 
04:05:57.050 --> 04:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
month olds and two-year-olds attorneys
 
04:05:58.849 --> 04:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
as a matter of wrote Because we all
 
04:06:01.389 --> 04:06:01.399 align:start position:0%
agree that that's probably not people's
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
best choice but there are circumstances
 
04:06:06.530 --> 04:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
where those kids might and this allows
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
for it so I appreciate that
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
um but I'm concerned about section
 
04:06:16.250 --> 04:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
number 21 to 25 regarding letting the
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
child essentially wave having an
 
04:06:21.229 --> 04:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
attorney I don't know that a 12 year old
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
who gets mad at their attorney should be
 
04:06:25.849 --> 04:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
able to waive that advice they can say
 
04:06:28.010 --> 04:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to follow it
 
04:06:30.530 --> 04:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
um but that worries me and the other big
 
04:06:33.889 --> 04:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
concern that I have with it is we
 
04:06:37.130 --> 04:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
haven't done any kind of research to
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
find out where this pool of attorneys is
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
going to come from and I don't see
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
anything in here
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
about who's going to pay for these
 
04:06:50.090 --> 04:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
attorneys and I don't want parents to be
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily burdened with additional
 
04:06:55.269 --> 04:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
legal fees and I don't want our system
 
04:06:58.610 --> 04:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
to have unnecessary backlogs if we
 
04:07:01.370 --> 04:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
simply cannot find attorneys who are
 
04:07:03.889 --> 04:07:03.899 align:start position:0%
let's assume willing to do whatever the
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
rate is that the the state decides I'd
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
really like to see this bill still
 
04:07:12.290 --> 04:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
retained a little bit longer so that
 
04:07:14.090 --> 04:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
there can be some sort of an
 
04:07:14.100 --> 04:07:15.309 align:start position:0%
there can be some sort of an
investigation

04:07:15.309 --> 04:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
honestly I would put it in the office of
 
04:07:20.389 --> 04:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
the child advocate to find out what
 
04:07:23.210 --> 04:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
where are we in our attorney situation
 
04:07:25.490 --> 04:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
what's the Staffing levels like what's
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
an appropriate compensation what are our
 
04:07:29.090 --> 04:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
neighbors doing for compensations for
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
this and where is this money going to
 
04:07:33.290 --> 04:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
come from to pay for these attorneys I
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
really hesitate to rush into appointing
 
04:07:39.050 --> 04:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
attorneys to kids when we don't have a
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
mechanism financially to pay for it
 
04:07:41.279 --> 04:07:42.490 align:start position:0%
mechanism financially to pay for it
without

04:07:42.490 --> 04:07:42.500 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:07:45.889 --> 04:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
burdening parents further and I I just I
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
can't get my mind around the financial
 
04:07:50.809 --> 04:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
impact yet but I can see myself getting
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
there if we have a financial plan which
 
04:07:55.610 --> 04:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunately still isn't attached
 
04:07:55.620 --> 04:07:56.889 align:start position:0%
unfortunately still isn't attached
so

04:07:56.889 --> 04:07:56.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:00.290 --> 04:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
let me speak a little bit here and that
 
04:08:02.510 --> 04:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
may because I think it may dovetail if
 
04:08:05.929 --> 04:08:05.939 align:start position:0%
you go back to lines 18 to 20 of the
 
04:08:05.939 --> 04:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
you go back to lines 18 to 20 of the
amendment

04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
um shall appoint an attorney to
 
04:08:12.130 --> 04:08:12.140 align:start position:0%
represent the child's Express's interest
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
turn to the next page
 
04:08:17.090 --> 04:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
and look to line two
 
04:08:20.570 --> 04:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
line two says this section will kick in
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2025.
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
the reason that is there I believe is
 
04:08:29.210 --> 04:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
multiple number one it gives the bar
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
association two years to learn how such
 
04:08:36.170 --> 04:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
appointed attorneys to children would
 
04:08:36.180 --> 04:08:37.189 align:start position:0%
appointed attorneys to children would
function

04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
function
 
04:08:40.189 --> 04:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
it will be not in the budget cycle we're
 
04:08:42.050 --> 04:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
working on now but in the next budget
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
cycle at which financial questions about
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
this I believe could be addressed and
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
the the third one about what other
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
states do we have a mechanism in the
 
04:08:55.550 --> 04:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
oversight Commission on children's
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
services who can do exactly that finding
 
04:09:01.130 --> 04:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
out what other states do and when it
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
works and finding out still other states
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
where maybe it didn't that we could
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
learn from so I think some of those
 
04:09:09.769 --> 04:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
questions that that were very wisely
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
raised I think they they have some
 
04:09:14.210 --> 04:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
answers to them representative D Simone
 
04:09:16.969 --> 04:09:16.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I wanted to talk a
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
little bit about the representatives
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
concerns and rightfully so however we're
 
04:09:27.170 --> 04:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
the policy committee and this is in
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
early bill because it will go from here
 
04:09:32.809 --> 04:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
to finance and finance will figure out
 
04:09:35.330 --> 04:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
who pays how much they pay when they pay
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
where they pay and so so forth so for
 
04:09:42.290 --> 04:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
this bill we're really supposed to be
 
04:09:44.330 --> 04:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
looking at what's in front of us which
 
04:09:47.330 --> 04:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
is the policy of the bill
 
04:09:50.330 --> 04:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know if that will help the
 
04:09:54.610 --> 04:09:54.620 align:start position:0%
representative with her questions or not
 
04:09:56.929 --> 04:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:09:59.090 --> 04:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I wholeheartedly
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Raymond
 
04:10:03.530 --> 04:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
um you know the fact that this is
 
04:10:06.650 --> 04:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
extended to 2025 tells me that it's not
 
04:10:06.660 --> 04:10:07.969 align:start position:0%
extended to 2025 tells me that it's not
ready

04:10:07.969 --> 04:10:07.979 align:start position:0%
ready
 
04:10:11.330 --> 04:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
um I I I agree with uh attorney
 
04:10:14.689 --> 04:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
appointments I mean I I received we all
 
04:10:16.849 --> 04:10:16.859 align:start position:0%
received ncaa's
 
04:10:20.570 --> 04:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
um uh latest study I believe it was uh
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and from what I got out of reading
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
that 70-something pages is the
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
importance of training so where are we
 
04:10:31.849 --> 04:10:31.859 align:start position:0%
going to get the attorneys it is is a is
 
04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
a good point because with that we'll
 
04:10:36.769 --> 04:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
come training for trauma-informed
 
04:10:39.710 --> 04:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys to use with these children
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
um you know in fact in 2025 that this
 
04:10:48.410 --> 04:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
kicks in uh in 2025 where where we're in
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
finance drafting a budget so this kicks
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
in when there isn't a budget yet
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
we don't know where the money is coming
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
from as of 2025. uh has a January of
 
04:11:01.979 --> 04:11:03.889 align:start position:0%
from as of 2025. uh has a January of
2025.

04:11:03.889 --> 04:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
04:11:07.490 --> 04:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
I I you know I
 
04:11:14.330 --> 04:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
hasn't B and C 16 and 18 uh you know the
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
May and then the 12 year old uh you know
 
04:11:19.010 --> 04:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
there were some seven or eight-year-olds
 
04:11:20.990 --> 04:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
or nine-year-olds even so I I so I want
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
to be sure that we're helping
 
04:11:28.189 --> 04:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
the the children that need the help
 
04:11:28.199 --> 04:11:28.910 align:start position:0%
the the children that need the help
um

04:11:28.910 --> 04:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:32.030 --> 04:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
in my mind supporting this in my mind
 
04:11:34.130 --> 04:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:11:34.140 --> 04:11:34.849 align:start position:0%
would be
um

04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:37.610 --> 04:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
better than nothing and and I don't I
 
04:11:38.929 --> 04:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
don't want to be better than nothing I
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
want to be what we believe is the best
 
04:11:44.210 --> 04:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
interests of uh these uh these children
 
04:11:47.330 --> 04:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bickford
 
04:11:49.729 --> 04:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:11:51.050 --> 04:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:11:53.510 --> 04:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
have the same issues that uh
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond last brought up
 
04:11:57.469 --> 04:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
in about
 
04:11:57.479 --> 04:11:59.389 align:start position:0%
in about
uh

04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:03.650 --> 04:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
mostly uh about who's paying here but
 
04:12:05.630 --> 04:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
pass this bill or try to we might
 
04:12:10.610 --> 04:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
actually get a count of
 
04:12:13.550 --> 04:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
10 11 but we need to get something like
 
04:12:15.889 --> 04:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
this that looks as complicated as to the
 
04:12:18.170 --> 04:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh the full assembly
 
04:12:21.469 --> 04:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh we need a pretty good vote so I'm
 
04:12:23.450 --> 04:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
going to recommend that we
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
consider withdrawing the motion of ought
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
to pass and go with the retain
 
04:12:30.170 --> 04:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
because I think we could polish this up
 
04:12:31.309 --> 04:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
so we get
 
04:12:33.170 --> 04:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
most of the whole committee on board
 
04:12:34.490 --> 04:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to need to get
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:43.130 --> 04:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative welcome
 
04:12:44.929 --> 04:12:44.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:12:47.150 --> 04:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to point out it was
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
stated that this was an early Bill
 
04:12:53.150 --> 04:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
however I believe it this is not an
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
early Bill well that's what I was going
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
to say if it was it had it was supposed
 
04:12:59.210 --> 04:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
to be on the calendar tomorrow or
 
04:13:01.370 --> 04:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
Thursday this is not an early Bill thank
 
04:13:01.380 --> 04:13:04.070 align:start position:0%
Thursday this is not an early Bill thank
you

04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:06.530 --> 04:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
04:13:08.570 --> 04:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
chairman uh if we're discussing some
 
04:13:10.729 --> 04:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
other changes that we might want to
 
04:13:13.849 --> 04:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
entertain with polishing this up
 
04:13:13.859 --> 04:13:15.050 align:start position:0%
entertain with polishing this up
um

04:13:15.050 --> 04:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:17.809 --> 04:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
I I agree with what representative
 
04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
Raymond was saying
 
04:13:22.490 --> 04:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
um for the most part uh for the vast
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
majority but also online 18 uh the child
 
04:13:30.650 --> 04:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
who is 12 years old or older at the date
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.170 --> 04:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
see I mean I realize like a lot of
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
things happen when a child is 12 but it
 
04:13:40.910 --> 04:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
also seems a little bit arbitrary to
 
04:13:43.729 --> 04:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
pick 12 as opposed to 10 as opposed to 8
 
04:13:46.729 --> 04:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
as opposed to so I would like to see
 
04:13:49.250 --> 04:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
maybe and and I could be the one to kind
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
of look it up especially we're retaining
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
in this this in committee and we could
 
04:13:54.830 --> 04:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
come back to it later
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
um see if they're you know what other
 
04:13:59.929 --> 04:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
states have on file for for that age uh
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
see if there's some research available
 
04:14:04.849 --> 04:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
for what age uh
 
04:14:07.370 --> 04:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
but unless there's
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
evidence that 12 year years old is the
 
04:14:14.689 --> 04:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
is the time where a child should have
 
04:14:16.729 --> 04:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
the attorney like maybe
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
we want to amend the wording to give a
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of leeway you know an 11 year
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with an 11 year old you
 
04:14:26.510 --> 04:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
know what's wrong with it
 
04:14:28.250 --> 04:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
it might be a little bit Case by case
 
04:14:28.260 --> 04:14:29.689 align:start position:0%
it might be a little bit Case by case
specific

04:14:29.689 --> 04:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:14:31.130 --> 04:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
um so we would want to put language in
 
04:14:32.929 --> 04:14:32.939 align:start position:0%
that for there
 
04:14:32.939 --> 04:14:33.830 align:start position:0%
that for there
um

04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:35.450 --> 04:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
and we might want to pick a different
 
04:14:35.460 --> 04:14:36.650 align:start position:0%
and we might want to pick a different
age

04:14:36.650 --> 04:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
age
 
04:14:36.660 --> 04:14:45.550 align:start position:0%
age
okay

04:14:45.550 --> 04:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
we have a suggestion that we can act on
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that is the suggestion is would the
 
04:14:58.010 --> 04:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
sponsor and second wish to withdraw so
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
that the bill could be retained and
 
04:15:03.050 --> 04:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
further worked on along the lines of
 
04:15:05.689 --> 04:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
what was suggested I'm not calling for a
 
04:15:08.450 --> 04:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
vote I'm just calling for a kind of a
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
sense is this something we might want to
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
do your head's pivot up and down or left
 
04:15:16.010 --> 04:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
to right
 
04:15:16.020 --> 04:15:19.670 align:start position:0%
to right
laughs

04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:28.010 --> 04:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
what do you think you you made the
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
motion I I be satisfied with with
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
retention with trying the OTP
 
04:15:46.729 --> 04:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:49.130 --> 04:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
okay now we have no motions on the floor
 
04:15:55.490 --> 04:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.500 --> 04:15:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:15:57.950 --> 04:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:15:59.590 --> 04:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
she can't see me
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
well you know I could pick up my cane
 
04:16:13.969 --> 04:16:13.979 align:start position:0%
and like thump it or something I don't
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
know that's tacky and you are only
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
adjacent to the Rowdy section you are
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
not in it so
 
04:16:25.309 --> 04:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
okay go thank you Mr chairman I move
 
04:16:27.410 --> 04:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
that we retain
 
04:16:30.830 --> 04:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
um HB 535 oh do I have to say the
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
04:16:36.530 --> 04:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
what's no no because now it goes back to
 
04:16:38.870 --> 04:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
the original Bill oh I don't but I like
 
04:16:44.450 --> 04:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:47.570 --> 04:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
if we retain it there's no reason why
 
04:16:50.450 --> 04:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
the amendment language cannot come back
 
04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
in its Glory with even more improvements
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay yes that's what I would like to do
 
04:17:03.410 --> 04:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
and you'll never guess what the check
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
chair needs right now
 
04:17:11.809 --> 04:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:17.090 --> 04:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:22.189 --> 04:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
now the word retains has two meanings in
 
04:17:24.889 --> 04:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
the dictionary for us one means death
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
With Dignity we hate it but we don't
 
04:17:29.090 --> 04:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
have the courage to say so
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
or it means we're going to keep it and
 
04:17:32.570 --> 04:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
we're going to work on it and we're
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
going to take counsel with each other
 
04:17:35.929 --> 04:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
and we're going to run back and forth
 
04:17:38.330 --> 04:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
and make this until you know everybody
 
04:17:41.389 --> 04:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
stands up in cheers that that's what I'm
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
hoping this is okay anything further of
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion which is
 
04:17:46.800 --> 04:17:48.550 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion which is
retained

04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
retained
 
04:17:51.170 --> 04:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
moved by representative Raymond second
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:00.290 --> 04:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
it recognizes representative Moulton
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for for the
 
04:18:05.090 --> 04:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
freshman in the at the table
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
um when does something that's retained
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
come back is it something we work on
 
04:18:11.210 --> 04:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
during the summer we can work on it
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
during the summer into the fall we will
 
04:18:15.050 --> 04:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
have a meeting of this committee
 
04:18:18.290 --> 04:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
sometime in the fall to pick up two
 
04:18:20.450 --> 04:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
already retained and it looks like maybe
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
a third one in others and we will work
 
04:18:26.150 --> 04:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
on them and we will vote on them and we
 
04:18:28.010 --> 04:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
will make our recommendations and you
 
04:18:30.170 --> 04:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
will write a wonderful blurb and then
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
early in January we vote on it I see
 
04:18:37.130 --> 04:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:38.929 --> 04:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
um along the lines of
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
what she just pointed out we used to do
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittees along the way and now I
 
04:18:48.769 --> 04:18:48.779 align:start position:0%
notice we're not doing that so much I do
 
04:18:50.389 --> 04:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
know that retain usually gives us more
 
04:18:52.849 --> 04:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
ability to look at than a subcommittee
 
04:18:55.370 --> 04:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
is that the idea usually it's this
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
chairman that appoints a subcommittee
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
yes purposely doing it this way rather
 
04:19:01.969 --> 04:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
than subcommittee I'm not purposely
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
doing anything right now except try to
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
get a vote but um what I would be
 
04:19:08.450 --> 04:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
interested in is
 
04:19:10.490 --> 04:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
um in a week or two I will announce the
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
different bills we've retained and ask
 
04:19:15.769 --> 04:19:15.779 align:start position:0%
of you which ones you would like to be
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:20.510 --> 04:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't answer my question but
 
04:19:23.150 --> 04:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
okay I know that
 
04:19:27.410 --> 04:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
all right I have called the question
 
04:19:30.590 --> 04:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
and now the clerk may call the roll
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:37.729 --> 04:19:37.739 align:start position:0%

04:21:12.410 --> 04:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
for a motion yes I'd like to make a
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
motion that we OTP
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
um house bill 471.
 
04:21:19.969 --> 04:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
all right yes the motion is OTP by
 
04:21:25.309 --> 04:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
who said second second representative
 
04:21:31.370 --> 04:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:31.380 --> 04:21:38.570 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

04:21:38.570 --> 04:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:21:43.130 --> 04:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I I certainly
 
04:21:46.010 --> 04:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
understand the need for final
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
disposition hearings given people uh
 
04:21:52.450 --> 04:21:52.460 align:start position:0%
Reliance on this will end in some time
 
04:21:55.490 --> 04:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
but I I believe that this bill has
 
04:21:58.370 --> 04:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
written is a false sense of a final
 
04:22:02.150 --> 04:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearing uh that that I
 
04:22:04.670 --> 04:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe this changes anything that
 
04:22:07.490 --> 04:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing in testimony
 
04:22:10.729 --> 04:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
um coming before us so
 
04:22:16.130 --> 04:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.889 --> 04:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
04:22:21.170 --> 04:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
and I second that that you know you're
 
04:22:24.490 --> 04:22:24.500 align:start position:0%
welcome oh no then I would but
 
04:22:26.510 --> 04:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative longsen but thank you Mr
 
04:22:26.520 --> 04:22:28.010 align:start position:0%
representative longsen but thank you Mr
Chuck

04:22:28.010 --> 04:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
Chuck
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
um sorry I cannot remember that part I'm
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
usually better with manners
 
04:22:34.729 --> 04:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
um you know divorces are complicated as
 
04:22:36.110 --> 04:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
we all know whether you've been in one
 
04:22:39.050 --> 04:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
or not but I think that what this bill
 
04:22:41.210 --> 04:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
is wanting to do which would be to help
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
streamline it and make it more
 
04:22:45.410 --> 04:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
predictable I think it's actually going
 
04:22:47.929 --> 04:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
to have a catastrophic backswing the
 
04:22:49.010 --> 04:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
other way
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
um the reason being is that you might
 
04:22:53.929 --> 04:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
have one divorce that could take like 30
 
04:22:56.150 --> 04:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
days and then you have another divorce
 
04:22:58.130 --> 04:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
that could take years the problem is if
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
we have to set if the judge has to set
 
04:23:02.990 --> 04:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
dates as soon as these come in and you
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
don't really know whether or not you
 
04:23:07.250 --> 04:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
want to try to reschedule it later or
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
anything else let's say you're the first
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the year but they have 6 000 cases
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
well by the time you get to the end how
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
many years off are you setting some of
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
these divorces that could have been 30
 
04:23:20.750 --> 04:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
days all of a sudden you have one that
 
04:23:22.670 --> 04:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
could have been quick but because they
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
had to set dates ahead of time now all
 
04:23:26.809 --> 04:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
of a sudden you're pushed out years
 
04:23:29.210 --> 04:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
because all these dates are filled and
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
then saying okay now we're gonna we had
 
04:23:33.410 --> 04:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
a cancellation you're on a cancellation
 
04:23:34.969 --> 04:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
list to come in earlier I think it
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
actually further complicates the court
 
04:23:37.080 --> 04:23:39.229 align:start position:0%
actually further complicates the court
system

04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:23:42.650 --> 04:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Raymond thank
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
04:23:46.010 --> 04:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
um I I share the same concerns as my
 
04:23:48.889 --> 04:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
colleagues this morning we heard a lot
 
04:23:52.130 --> 04:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
of really moving testimony on um another
 
04:23:56.330 --> 04:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh issue on H.R 14 and in part of that
 
04:23:59.090 --> 04:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
testimony it sounds like there's a
 
04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
general consensus amongst people
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
involved in family court and certainly
 
04:24:05.689 --> 04:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
with the judicial branch itself that the
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
family court is taking
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
um a significant amount of time to
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
resolve some of these cases and so I
 
04:24:13.130 --> 04:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
think it's laudable to try and come up
 
04:24:15.229 --> 04:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
with Solutions but what we heard today
 
04:24:18.769 --> 04:24:18.779 align:start position:0%
is that they have 127 000 new cases each
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
year and only we're done 42 full-time
 
04:24:25.370 --> 04:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
judges to make all that happen so I know
 
04:24:26.809 --> 04:24:26.819 align:start position:0%
that they're requesting additional
 
04:24:30.170 --> 04:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
judges in this coming budget year and a
 
04:24:31.929 --> 04:24:31.939 align:start position:0%
significant number of additional clerks
 
04:24:36.769 --> 04:24:36.779 align:start position:0%
and I I would urge us to see how
 
04:24:40.189 --> 04:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
additional Staffing assists and get
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
staff onboarded before we start
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
requiring scheduling of things because I
 
04:24:47.389 --> 04:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
just I really hate the idea of someone
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
coming in and filing for divorce and
 
04:24:51.410 --> 04:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
then hearing that their final hearing
 
04:24:54.110 --> 04:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be for 24 months because
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid that if we pass this now that
 
04:24:58.670 --> 04:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
the the court is going to err on the
 
04:25:00.830 --> 04:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
side of well this is our next free day
 
04:25:03.170 --> 04:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
for you know to schedule these things
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
because we have to keep open time in the
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
meantime for the other 126 999 cases
 
04:25:13.250 --> 04:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
that we know are coming so my feeling on
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
this is that now is not the time
 
04:25:17.279 --> 04:25:18.670 align:start position:0%
this is that now is not the time
here

04:25:18.670 --> 04:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:25:21.410 --> 04:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
04:25:23.929 --> 04:25:23.939 align:start position:0%
chairman the other
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh unanticipated consequence that that
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
we might end up seeing with if if this
 
04:25:33.110 --> 04:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill was executed as written
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I know in my case we had a temporary
 
04:25:39.790 --> 04:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
Hearing in
 
04:25:43.790 --> 04:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
October and they gave us the date of the
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
first day after January 1st which came
 
04:25:48.410 --> 04:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
and went and we and and it never
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
actually came to fruition so we might
 
04:25:54.010 --> 04:25:54.020 align:start position:0%
end up finding that in order to meet the
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
the rules of the of the statute that
 
04:25:59.990 --> 04:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
that judges are just throwing out these
 
04:26:02.450 --> 04:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
dates and not actually like meeting them
 
04:26:05.090 --> 04:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
because the dockets are so full so if if
 
04:26:07.370 --> 04:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
they're not actually coming to fruition
 
04:26:10.010 --> 04:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
then it's then it's a useless bill
 
04:26:10.020 --> 04:26:12.110 align:start position:0%
then it's then it's a useless bill
so

04:26:12.110 --> 04:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:15.889 --> 04:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.570 --> 04:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
I believe the purpose of the bill is to
 
04:26:19.969 --> 04:26:19.979 align:start position:0%
you're welcome I'm sorry I'm terribly
 
04:26:19.979 --> 04:26:21.530 align:start position:0%
you're welcome I'm sorry I'm terribly
sorry

04:26:21.530 --> 04:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
I choose my poor manners chairman
 
04:26:25.370 --> 04:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you for recognizing at
 
04:26:30.410 --> 04:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
um anyways I believe my understanding of
 
04:26:38.269 --> 04:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
the bill was
 
04:26:40.490 --> 04:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
um pretty much to get the people
 
04:26:42.530 --> 04:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
um into the queue because it is taking
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
so long so rather than having them work
 
04:26:47.689 --> 04:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
on their divorce situations and then
 
04:26:50.090 --> 04:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
decide okay well let's get on the docket
 
04:26:52.849 --> 04:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
and then find out the docket is a year
 
04:26:54.170 --> 04:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
or two years out when they've already
 
04:26:54.180 --> 04:26:55.189 align:start position:0%
or two years out when they've already
lost

04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
lost
 
04:26:57.490 --> 04:26:57.500 align:start position:0%
however many months
 
04:27:00.170 --> 04:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I believe that in testimony they
 
04:27:03.889 --> 04:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
were also saying that as we keep people
 
04:27:06.649 --> 04:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
hanging and waiting and waiting uh in
 
04:27:09.410 --> 04:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
limbo to get onto the docket it causes
 
04:27:10.969 --> 04:27:10.979 align:start position:0%
more damage to the minor children who
 
04:27:12.530 --> 04:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
are going through the trauma of the
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
parents who continue to fight it's
 
04:27:15.769 --> 04:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
costing the families more money because
 
04:27:18.649 --> 04:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
more emotions are being filed tensions
 
04:27:21.050 --> 04:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
are getting higher and a lot of that is
 
04:27:23.630 --> 04:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
just from frustration in waiting to have
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:30.720 --> 04:27:32.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to peek into every corner
 
04:27:38.990 --> 04:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else nope representative Bickford
 
04:27:39.000 --> 04:27:40.250 align:start position:0%
anyone else nope representative Bickford
sure

04:27:40.250 --> 04:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:27:44.689 --> 04:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
um I too am not ready to go forward with
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
this bill apparently because they it it
 
04:27:49.010 --> 04:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
gets under divorce it should be broader
 
04:27:51.649 --> 04:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
than divorce but the main reason
 
04:27:51.659 --> 04:27:52.849 align:start position:0%
than divorce but the main reason
is

04:27:52.849 --> 04:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:27:52.859 --> 04:27:55.610 align:start position:0%
is
um

04:27:55.610 --> 04:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.250 --> 04:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
we heard from Richard head that there's
 
04:27:59.929 --> 04:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
a real serious problem with getting
 
04:28:03.110 --> 04:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
cases and such
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh on the docket in the right place
 
04:28:08.090 --> 04:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
and I believe they're trying to do
 
04:28:09.410 --> 04:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
something about it I talked to judge
 
04:28:13.250 --> 04:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
Legend finance and this this is a seems
 
04:28:15.889 --> 04:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
to be a money issue with 127 000 was a
 
04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
thousand or yeah I get lost the numbers
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
so high and and I think I'm not ready to
 
04:28:25.370 --> 04:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
jump in and start tinkering with the
 
04:28:27.229 --> 04:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
Machinery of the court and this is what
 
04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is about tinkering with
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
their system
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't mean it shouldn't happen
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
and I may be completely wrong at this
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
point but I'm just not ready to jump
 
04:28:37.910 --> 04:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
jump in
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
so I
 
04:28:39.840 --> 04:28:41.870 align:start position:0%
so I
um

04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:43.849 --> 04:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to vote no on the ought
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:54.290 --> 04:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:57.889 --> 04:28:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:00.530 --> 04:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative panic
 
04:29:01.910 --> 04:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:03.769 --> 04:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
um chairman I do have an eye doctor's
 
04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
appointment on Friday I missed you I'm
 
04:29:05.640 --> 04:29:07.189 align:start position:0%
appointment on Friday I missed you I'm
sorry

04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:29:09.769 --> 04:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
I just got my new glasses how they're
 
04:29:12.410 --> 04:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
doing I can see you now so the eyes have
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
04:29:13.080 --> 04:29:17.630 align:start position:0%
it yeah
[Laughter]

04:29:17.630 --> 04:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:20.510 --> 04:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
is there a way that we could
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
move to on to pass under the condition
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
that we try and get more judges no
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
just asking good idea thank you we're
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
trying to get more judges believe me a
 
04:29:35.330 --> 04:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
lot of us are trying to get more judges
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to law school after all I
 
04:29:39.170 --> 04:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
was afraid they might pick me and I
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that I like this
 
04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't think this is one of these
 
04:29:50.510 --> 04:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
bills that if we retained it for six
 
04:29:52.250 --> 04:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
months we could Square the circle I
 
04:29:53.929 --> 04:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
think it's either we we say it or we
 
04:29:55.610 --> 04:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
don't say it I'm not sure if there's a
 
04:30:00.170 --> 04:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
middle place is there right you can of
 
04:30:02.929 --> 04:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
course however I'm looking forward to HR
 
04:30:05.809 --> 04:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
14 to help resolve some of these issues
 
04:30:07.729 --> 04:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
and as I said I talked to Judge Lynn
 
04:30:09.050 --> 04:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
about coming in with an amendment for
 
04:30:12.410 --> 04:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
that one and seeing if we can stop being
 
04:30:16.070 --> 04:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
a get together on these issues and go
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
from there but meantime in the meantime
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
yeah you can but it I don't think it's
 
04:30:24.290 --> 04:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
going to buy it a whole lot
 
04:30:27.889 --> 04:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
now Last Chance seeing no other hands
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:35.809 --> 04:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson I I would
 
04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
like to just point out that um
 
04:30:40.070 --> 04:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
in testimony it was told that in
 
04:30:41.809 --> 04:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
Criminal Court that everything is
 
04:30:44.689 --> 04:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
scheduled right up front and I I just
 
04:30:47.210 --> 04:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
question as to why in in divorce
 
04:30:50.090 --> 04:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
proceedings that the parents or the the
 
04:30:52.610 --> 04:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
two parties that are seeking to and
 
04:30:54.110 --> 04:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
their marriage aren't given the same
 
04:30:57.469 --> 04:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
courtesy even if it's scheduling out 24
 
04:31:00.590 --> 04:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
months at least they have an idea of
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
when they're getting out of court rather
 
04:31:05.990 --> 04:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
than just kind of languishing there and
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
just in a state of limbo of not knowing
 
04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
what's happening how do they plan their
 
04:31:11.870 --> 04:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
life ahead maybe they want to move on
 
04:31:14.450 --> 04:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
maybe they want you know it just let's
 
04:31:17.330 --> 04:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
just let's just allow the court to be
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
honest with them and tell them when
 
04:31:22.969 --> 04:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
there can expect that they're have a
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
final hearing
 
04:31:26.809 --> 04:31:26.819 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Moulton thank
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I do think there's
 
04:31:32.410 --> 04:31:32.420 align:start position:0%
some value in letting some time elapse
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
did in my in my personal situation I
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
didn't see the value in that and I
 
04:31:41.689 --> 04:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
wanted you know I know what I want to
 
04:31:43.370 --> 04:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
ask for and you know this is what we
 
04:31:46.010 --> 04:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
need in blah blah blah But as time
 
04:31:49.550 --> 04:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
elapsed different issues came up that we
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't foresee in the beginning so
 
04:31:54.889 --> 04:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
having that time elapsed having you know
 
04:31:58.729 --> 04:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
my my soon-to-be ex and I uh try to
 
04:32:00.649 --> 04:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
resolve them and you know some things
 
04:32:02.090 --> 04:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
we're able to get results on things
 
04:32:04.910 --> 04:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
weren't you know things like that
 
04:32:07.189 --> 04:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
um the time is a little bit valuable
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's frustrating and you know not
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
having the orders that you want make you
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
know Muddy's Waters and and things like
 
04:32:17.570 --> 04:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
that but by
 
04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
seeing different issues that have popped
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
up we can get that language into the
 
04:32:27.649 --> 04:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:30.110 --> 04:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
I think to answer your question I think
 
04:32:33.769 --> 04:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
that because with a criminal case you
 
04:32:36.110 --> 04:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
already it's not ongoing like one thing
 
04:32:38.210 --> 04:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
happened and that was it you know
 
04:32:38.220 --> 04:32:39.769 align:start position:0%
happened and that was it you know
whereas

04:32:39.769 --> 04:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
04:32:39.779 --> 04:32:40.969 align:start position:0%
whereas
with

04:32:40.969 --> 04:32:40.979 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:32:43.370 --> 04:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
child and family you know things are
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
always evolving and situations are
 
04:32:47.450 --> 04:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
always you know changing and and stuff
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:32:49.439 --> 04:32:51.969 align:start position:0%
like that
so

04:32:51.969 --> 04:32:51.979 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I just happen to think that the
 
04:32:59.210 --> 04:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
advantage of a retain would be that this
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
could come back next year if we don't
 
04:33:02.450 --> 04:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
retain it we have to wait two years for
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
it to crop up again
 
04:33:05.520 --> 04:33:11.810 align:start position:0%
it to crop up again
um

04:33:11.810 --> 04:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.230 --> 04:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
then I'll call the question the motion
 
04:33:23.570 --> 04:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
before us is on House Bill 471 FN

04:34:46.609 --> 04:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
are you making a motion to retain
 
04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
that is in order
 
04:34:56.929 --> 04:34:56.939 align:start position:0%
does anyone wish to Second the retain I
 
04:35:01.250 --> 04:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:05.570 --> 04:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:07.730 --> 04:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:35:12.051 --> 04:35:12.061 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what value retaining
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
this would have
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
um I mean either they can clear the
 
04:35:19.250 --> 04:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
dockets and and you know hire more
 
04:35:21.769 --> 04:35:21.779 align:start position:0%
judges or or promote lawyers to judges
 
04:35:25.849 --> 04:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
or or they can't and that's a
 
04:35:31.131 --> 04:35:31.141 align:start position:0%
complicated issue so uh I would
 
04:35:33.890 --> 04:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
be can I would be concerned that that
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
retaining it isn't going to help
 
04:35:39.769 --> 04:35:39.779 align:start position:0%
fix up the language to to make this uh
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
bill that could actually be executed uh
 
04:35:45.230 --> 04:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
so I personally would be in in favor of
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
it yelling it but but the motion on the
 
04:35:50.570 --> 04:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
floor is is to retained so
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
we should defend your retain you you
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
were going down a line of thought there
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
a minute ago on this right well my
 
04:36:00.769 --> 04:36:00.779 align:start position:0%
reasons for retain is if we should learn
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
in during retain
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the court really hasn't done their
 
04:36:06.480 --> 04:36:07.369 align:start position:0%
that the court really hasn't done their
job

04:36:07.369 --> 04:36:07.379 align:start position:0%
job
 
04:36:08.929 --> 04:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
the way they should and we feel that
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
they can be directed by the legislature
 
04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
we would be able to come forward next
 
04:36:16.369 --> 04:36:16.379 align:start position:0%
year I think it's in January usually the
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
retained bills are acted upon or we
 
04:36:21.529 --> 04:36:21.539 align:start position:0%
could just at that time let it go so
 
04:36:22.970 --> 04:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's the advantage you gain a year if
 
04:36:34.730 --> 04:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:34.740 --> 04:36:37.010 align:start position:0%
 
gosh

04:36:37.010 --> 04:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
gosh
 
04:36:39.650 --> 04:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
um even the rowdies are quiet
 
04:36:44.929 --> 04:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
04:36:51.170 --> 04:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering how what would
 
04:36:51.180 --> 04:36:52.070 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering how what would
we

04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
if we retained this what would you
 
04:36:55.199 --> 04:36:56.689 align:start position:0%
if we retained this what would you
suggest

04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
um that we would do just call each
 
04:37:01.970 --> 04:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
individual court and and ask them like
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
like survey them so to speak about what
 
04:37:08.269 --> 04:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
issues are are the stop block on the
 
04:37:10.189 --> 04:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
docket but we would have to call every
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
single like Court in the state
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering just in good
 
04:37:18.410 --> 04:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
asking in good faith what how we would
 
04:37:20.090 --> 04:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
find out this information
 
04:37:23.631 --> 04:37:23.641 align:start position:0%
why I start by thank you Mr chairman by
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
going back to
 
04:37:26.810 --> 04:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
um Mr head
 
04:37:29.090 --> 04:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
who comes to here for the court system
 
04:37:31.490 --> 04:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
and then you'd ask him if you couldn't
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
interview some
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
people and you may want to take some
 
04:37:36.830 --> 04:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
statements from uh other people which I
 
04:37:38.510 --> 04:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
think will just show up anyway
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
I don't expect it would take a lot of
 
04:37:44.090 --> 04:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh time maybe a couple meetings and then
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
you'd sit on it
 
04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:48.061 align:start position:0%
wait and see
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh we just heard
 
04:37:56.631 --> 04:37:56.641 align:start position:0%
an H HR 14 which is going to look at all
 
04:37:58.250 --> 04:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
this stuff and what representative
 
04:38:00.830 --> 04:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
Bickford's alluding to that if we retain
 
04:38:03.051 --> 04:38:03.061 align:start position:0%
this we could bring It Forward then in
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
January if we itl it it won't come back
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
for another two years so there may be a
 
04:38:07.680 --> 04:38:08.510 align:start position:0%
for another two years so there may be a
fix

04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
fix
 
04:38:11.330 --> 04:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
that we could work that we could put in
 
04:38:13.609 --> 04:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
good language for this uh so that's
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's that reason so I'm going to
 
04:38:17.929 --> 04:38:17.939 align:start position:0%
support the retain retention
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
also I always go looking for what do
 
04:38:22.131 --> 04:38:22.141 align:start position:0%
other states do do other states have
 
04:38:24.830 --> 04:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing they have people with
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
problems and judges on benches and so on
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
and what do they do and
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I hate to say uh I will ask my
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
research committee research assistant to
 
04:38:39.310 --> 04:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
do it but I know she will thank you
 
04:38:45.650 --> 04:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.449 --> 04:38:47.459 align:start position:0%

yes

04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:41:23.930 --> 04:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:41:26.750 --> 04:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I cannot support this bill
 
04:41:28.610 --> 04:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
um I don't see that anybody has
 
04:41:31.850 --> 04:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
submitted an amendment and my concerns
 
04:41:35.150 --> 04:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
remain the same that they were when it
 
04:41:38.570 --> 04:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
came before us a few weeks ago so
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
um the this bill basically is making an
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
allegation that dcyf is not providing
 
04:41:48.050 --> 04:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
families with records the way that they
 
04:41:50.208 --> 04:41:50.218 align:start position:0%
ought to be and we received significant
 
04:41:53.390 --> 04:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that already dcyf is required
 
04:41:55.730 --> 04:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
to give parents their records but they
 
04:41:58.128 --> 04:41:58.138 align:start position:0%
have to submit a request and then they
 
04:42:01.128 --> 04:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
have 60 days to do it however dcyf
 
04:42:03.050 --> 04:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't currently have the staff to
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
always meet that 60-day thing
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
furthermore we learned that if you have
 
04:42:10.010 --> 04:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
an open assessment that has not had a
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
finding made unfounded or founded you're
 
04:42:16.010 --> 04:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
not going to have the records and if
 
04:42:17.810 --> 04:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
there is a case where the police are
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
involved you're not getting the records
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
then either because then you're obstruct
 
04:42:23.208 --> 04:42:23.218 align:start position:0%
acting a case that the police are doing
 
04:42:25.150 --> 04:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
and nobody wants to get involved in that
 
04:42:28.730 --> 04:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
so this is a bill that seeks to
 
04:42:32.090 --> 04:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
solve a problem without really getting
 
04:42:34.910 --> 04:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
to the basis of what the problem is or
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
if there is a problem the last reason
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to oppose this is that I
 
04:42:42.050 --> 04:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
think that part of the
 
04:42:45.708 --> 04:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
um the germane point of the the bill was
 
04:42:48.890 --> 04:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
to try and access other records so if
 
04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
your child or your family is involved in
 
04:42:53.390 --> 04:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
tcyf dcyf is going to collect records
 
04:42:56.330 --> 04:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
from the schools from the pediatrician
 
04:42:56.340 --> 04:42:57.948 align:start position:0%
from the schools from the pediatrician
from

04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
um you know a therapist anyone that a
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
parent signs permission for dcif to
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
access records from dcyf is prevented
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
based on HIPAA from re-releasing those
 
04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
third party records there's literally no
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
way that dcyf can legally give you what
 
04:43:18.890 --> 04:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
the pediatrician gave dcyf if you want
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
that information you need to go directly
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
to the pediatrician or to the school or
 
04:43:25.128 --> 04:43:25.138 align:start position:0%
to the therapist and then you have a
 
04:43:26.930 --> 04:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
right to have it because you're the
 
04:43:30.110 --> 04:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
parent so I think that
 
04:43:30.120 --> 04:43:30.890 align:start position:0%
parent so I think that
um

04:43:30.890 --> 04:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
again I really think this is a bill
 
04:43:36.288 --> 04:43:36.298 align:start position:0%
um based on someone's personal
 
04:43:38.270 --> 04:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
experience where they didn't feel like
 
04:43:39.770 --> 04:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
they had a good experience and now
 
04:43:42.410 --> 04:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
they're trying to legislate based on one
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
example and I just don't I don't think
 
04:43:46.670 --> 04:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriate use of our of um
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
of our committee time or legislative
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
powers so
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:06.890 --> 04:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:44:11.208 --> 04:44:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass
 
04:44:16.730 --> 04:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 497 relative to the
 
04:44:18.890 --> 04:44:18.900 align:start position:0%

executive session on 497 and with that
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
opening I will open the hearing on House
 
04:47:03.470 --> 04:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 185 FN relative to the
 
04:47:05.448 --> 04:47:05.458 align:start position:0%
determination of parental rights and
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities based on shared
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
parenting and shared access to the
 
04:47:15.128 --> 04:47:15.138 align:start position:0%
child's records and I believe
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative posts will come forward
 
04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:47:26.570 --> 04:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:26.580 --> 04:47:37.310 align:start position:0%
 
95

04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:37.320 --> 04:47:42.128 align:start position:0%
 
.

04:47:42.128 --> 04:47:42.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony points well can we just
 
04:47:47.690 --> 04:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
get two yeah
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
take my mom and write those out
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
and believe it or not this bill has the
 
04:47:57.530 --> 04:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:07.368 --> 04:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
the chair is going to be passing around
 
04:48:13.970 --> 04:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
an amendment by the Bill's Prime sponsor
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the reason I do that is not that we
 
04:48:18.170 --> 04:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
can necessarily vote on it unless we
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
choose to go into an exec session but
 
04:48:22.250 --> 04:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
because very often the bill is
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
originally written I had a journey on
 
04:48:27.890 --> 04:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
its way to us and this will give us at
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
least a chance to see what the prime
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor is is thinking so that's why
 
04:48:36.410 --> 04:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
you're getting this
 
04:48:36.420 --> 04:48:37.250 align:start position:0%
you're getting this
um

04:48:37.250 --> 04:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:39.410 --> 04:48:39.420 align:start position:0%

but if I may I will take my leave
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
I will take my leave now it was a
 
04:48:53.650 --> 04:48:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.350 --> 04:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%

I come before you today
 
04:50:38.810 --> 04:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
to improve the lives of children and
 
04:50:41.868 --> 04:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
strengthen Society by protecting every
 
04:50:45.110 --> 04:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
child's rights to the love and care of
 
04:50:48.650 --> 04:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
both parents after separation or divorce
 
04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I believe you'll agree with me
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill has been before this
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
committee and house many times over the
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
years and many legislators have come
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
before me with similar bills that have
 
04:51:03.288 --> 04:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
passed both the committee and the house
 
04:51:06.530 --> 04:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
but never made it into law
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
permitting the court system is not
 
04:51:10.490 --> 04:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
working for children who do not have
 
04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
regular contact with both parents and I
 
04:51:17.170 --> 04:51:17.180 align:start position:0%
think you heard in HR 14 this morning
 
04:51:19.970 --> 04:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
a woman named Linda who was talking
 
04:51:22.128 --> 04:51:22.138 align:start position:0%
about the process the process is broken
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
it takes too long and it leaves families
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
in a very bad state
 
04:51:29.400 --> 04:51:30.830 align:start position:0%
in a very bad state
uh

04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:33.050 --> 04:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
the child's best interest is to have the

education and well-being of the child
 
04:51:51.170 --> 04:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
there is a growing and compelling
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
consensus among researchers that true
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
shared parenting is usually in the best
 
04:51:58.910 --> 04:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
04:52:01.490 --> 04:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
moms and dads have different talents
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
skills and approaches to life and this
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
creates a diverse environment for the
 
04:52:08.390 --> 04:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
child to learn grow
 
04:52:10.910 --> 04:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
and be confident under the care of their

and be confident under the care of their
parents

04:52:12.410 --> 04:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:52:14.570 --> 04:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
our laws should be clear and concise
 
04:52:17.090 --> 04:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
that no parent should be denied the
 
04:52:20.330 --> 04:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
ability to execute their Duty and power
 
04:52:23.110 --> 04:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
to protect the rights of the child
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of separation or divorce
 
04:52:28.850 --> 04:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
several states have recently passed
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
legislation beginning with the
 
04:52:33.890 --> 04:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
presumption of joint custody which is in
 
04:52:36.890 --> 04:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
the child's best interest unless the
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
courts find there is an abundance of
 
04:52:43.190 --> 04:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence of abuse
 
04:52:47.448 --> 04:52:47.458 align:start position:0%
and neglect and that is something that
 
04:52:47.458 --> 04:52:48.050 align:start position:0%
and neglect and that is something that
um

04:52:48.050 --> 04:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:51.170 --> 04:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
they are using the language in so that
 
04:52:54.410 --> 04:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
the courts really dig into what's going
 
04:52:54.420 --> 04:52:55.670 align:start position:0%
the courts really dig into what's going
on

04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:52:58.910 --> 04:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
my hope that this is the year of the
 
04:53:01.730 --> 04:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
child to thrive with both parents in
 
04:53:03.530 --> 04:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
their lives and I ask for your support

04:54:23.510 --> 04:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.730 --> 04:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
my name is Karen Calabro
 
04:54:28.610 --> 04:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
um District Hillsboro 45. okay welcome
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's only like 6 000 of us here so
 
04:54:34.128 --> 04:54:34.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
um I am I'm speaking on behalf of the um
 
04:54:40.670 --> 04:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
as primary care provider to the homeless
 
04:54:42.410 --> 04:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
um I got to see a lot of people kind of
 
04:54:44.270 --> 04:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
falling through the cracks I see a lot
 
04:54:46.010 --> 04:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
of families that are undergoing a lot of
 
04:54:48.410 --> 04:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
upheaval unfortunately it is my
 
04:54:51.170 --> 04:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
population and it is very oftentimes the
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
people whom you are talking about
 
04:54:55.610 --> 04:54:55.620 align:start position:0%
um the number one thing that I can tell
 
04:54:57.770 --> 04:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
you as a predictor of failure is a
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
disengaged parent
 
04:55:02.270 --> 04:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
um whether it be through geography or
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
through financial means or through
 
04:55:04.920 --> 04:55:06.230 align:start position:0%
through financial means or through
um

04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:08.090 --> 04:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
by choice
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of them have addiction issues and
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
and whatnot that'll oftentimes keep them
 
04:55:14.208 --> 04:55:14.218 align:start position:0%
from it and that would make good sense
 
04:55:17.330 --> 04:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
but assuming that these people have an
 
04:55:19.368 --> 04:55:19.378 align:start position:0%
interest I have seen more fathers
 
04:55:22.368 --> 04:55:22.378 align:start position:0%
squandering waiting to see their child
 
04:55:24.050 --> 04:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
then I care to count
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
and their sobriety is on the line
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
waiting so that they can have that
 
04:55:27.958 --> 04:55:29.030 align:start position:0%
waiting so that they can have that
stability

04:55:29.030 --> 04:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
stability
 
04:55:30.590 --> 04:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
so I'd ask you to consider the spot
 
04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.590 --> 04:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for your time do you
 
04:55:37.730 --> 04:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
04:55:40.010 --> 04:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
how soon before I get the pink card
 
04:55:40.020 --> 04:55:42.590 align:start position:0%
how soon before I get the pink card
[Laughter]

04:55:42.590 --> 04:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:55:46.010 --> 04:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.868 --> 04:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
it's very good thank you thank you

playing field parents knowing going into
 
04:58:15.650 --> 04:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
separation of divorce the child will
 
04:58:18.650 --> 04:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
have equal access with both parents they
 
04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
will no longer be litigating Petty
 
04:58:22.490 --> 04:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
grievances or making false allegations
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
of abuse or neglect to gain the upper
 
04:58:26.810 --> 04:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
hand in court proceedings less
 
04:58:29.150 --> 04:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
litigation frees the overburdened
 
04:58:32.868 --> 04:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
dockets from unnecessary litigation
 
04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
I believe it is the appropriate time to
 
04:58:37.850 --> 04:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
pass House Bill 185 we need to legislate
 
04:58:39.650 --> 04:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
good policies that work for most
 
04:58:42.830 --> 04:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
citizens this bill does still protect
 
04:58:45.410 --> 04:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
children from abuse and neglect
 
04:58:49.368 --> 04:58:49.378 align:start position:0%
and that is in our statue already
 
04:58:55.128 --> 04:58:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%

um to meet their basic needs we also
 
04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
operate a domestic violence advocacy
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
project where we represent clients who
 
04:59:37.368 --> 04:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
have been screened in for a high
 
04:59:40.250 --> 04:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
lethality domestic violence cases those
 
04:59:42.170 --> 04:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
are the kinds of cases where there's a
 
04:59:44.830 --> 04:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
likelihood that someone could be killed
 
04:59:47.050 --> 04:59:47.060 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:59:49.788 --> 04:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
protective order cases and we also do
 
04:59:52.730 --> 04:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting cases I'm here to
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
um my colleague Aaron Jacina did
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
circulate some written testimony in
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
05:00:05.810 --> 05:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
um an article from The Battered Women's
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
Justice project to also talk about this
 
05:00:11.810 --> 05:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
issue I'll just highlight that a main
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
reason why a parent may stay in an
 
05:00:18.288 --> 05:00:18.298 align:start position:0%
abusive marriage or relationship is to
 
05:00:21.410 --> 05:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
protect the children and for fear that
 
05:00:24.288 --> 05:00:24.298 align:start position:0%
the children will be taken away from
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
them if they do leave the relationship
 
05:00:29.868 --> 05:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
because that's often a threat that's
 
05:00:33.730 --> 05:00:33.740 align:start position:0%
used to control a victim who's
 
05:00:37.030 --> 05:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
abused in addition to financial control
 
05:00:39.948 --> 05:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the courthouse is the last
 
05:00:44.208 --> 05:00:44.218 align:start position:0%
place where an abuser can exert that
 
05:00:48.650 --> 05:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
control and manipulation that fear that
 
05:00:50.810 --> 05:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
a victim may have for their own safety
 
05:00:52.490 --> 05:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
and their children's safety may cause
 
05:00:55.730 --> 05:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
them to decide to stay together if a
 
05:00:57.530 --> 05:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
bill like this passes what where the
 
05:01:00.490 --> 05:01:00.500 align:start position:0%
presumption is equal parenting
 
05:01:04.730 --> 05:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
that could just cause them to remain in
 
05:01:06.530 --> 05:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
that relationship for fear that their
 
05:01:09.010 --> 05:01:09.020 align:start position:0%
children will spend
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
time with an abusive parent the current
 
05:01:16.610 --> 05:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
law where we the presumption Is frequent
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
and continuing contact is has worked
 
05:01:21.490 --> 05:01:21.500 align:start position:0%
really well since
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
2005. I've been to this committee
 
05:01:25.788 --> 05:01:25.798 align:start position:0%
several times I've worked on a
 
05:01:28.250 --> 05:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
commission or a committee over the
 
05:01:31.208 --> 05:01:31.218 align:start position:0%
summer to make some tweaks to that
 
05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities law
 
05:01:36.650 --> 05:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure that really frequent
 
05:01:39.170 --> 05:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
and continuing contact is the policy
 
05:01:41.868 --> 05:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
that's stated in the law we've inserted
 
05:01:43.310 --> 05:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
it into a couple of other places
 
05:01:45.288 --> 05:01:45.298 align:start position:0%
including in the best interest standard
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
that currently is in the law and so
 
05:01:50.930 --> 05:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
courts are very aware of that the other
 
05:01:53.930 --> 05:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
thing that is concerning about this is
 
05:01:56.810 --> 05:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
it creates clear and convincing evidence
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
as a standard currently the standard for
 
05:02:02.690 --> 05:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
a court to determine what's in a child's
 
05:02:05.090 --> 05:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
best interest in terms of parenting time
 
05:02:07.310 --> 05:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
is preponderance of the evidence and
 
05:02:09.530 --> 05:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
that is like a lower standard clear and
 
05:02:11.810 --> 05:02:11.820 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence is a higher standard
 
05:02:13.850 --> 05:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
and it's very unusual in the Civil
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
context to be utilized so it's harder to
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrate improve and what I see this
 
05:02:23.868 --> 05:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
doing is as it is it really undermines
 
05:02:26.510 --> 05:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to analyze what is in the
 
05:02:28.730 --> 05:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
child's best interest elevating a
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
children's rights over parent rights and
 
05:02:33.770 --> 05:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
this is a parental rights and
 
05:02:35.810 --> 05:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
responsibilities law so this committee
 
05:02:38.270 --> 05:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
really needs to think about the change
 
05:02:40.850 --> 05:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
in the policy that it would set in
 
05:02:43.250 --> 05:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
adopting something that elevates the
 
05:02:45.110 --> 05:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
child's rights above a parent's rights
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
which it potentially could do and is an
 
05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
interesting Dynamic that I hadn't
 
05:02:52.430 --> 05:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
actually considered until I sat and
 
05:02:56.330 --> 05:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
listened to the the testimony before me
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
so I those are some of the reasons I
 
05:03:01.970 --> 05:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
would caution moving forward with this
 
05:03:04.730 --> 05:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
um and I'll happy to take any questions
 
05:03:07.310 --> 05:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
my question is you would not have this
 
05:03:10.128 --> 05:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
before you it was just given to us but
 
05:03:12.788 --> 05:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
would you believe that in the amendment
 
05:03:17.050 --> 05:03:17.060 align:start position:0%
uh rebuttable is evidence of abuse
 
05:03:20.270 --> 05:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
including evidence of abuses defined and
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
it gives several rsas or criminal
 
05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
assault or abuse so the idea of
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
co-parenting if one parent may be an
 
05:03:30.610 --> 05:03:30.620 align:start position:0%
abuser is specifically
 
05:03:32.930 --> 05:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
rebutted here
 
05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen the amendment and I'm
 
05:03:37.730 --> 05:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
happy to take a look at that um and and
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
you know provide for their testimony on
 
05:03:39.958 --> 05:03:40.910 align:start position:0%
you know provide for their testimony on
that

05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
um the concern is the clear and
 
05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence standard as well and
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
I think that that really
 
05:03:49.128 --> 05:03:49.138 align:start position:0%
um elevates the ability for somebody
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
who's already
 
05:03:53.868 --> 05:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
um having a hard time articulating you
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
know because of trauma the the kind of
 
05:03:59.570 --> 05:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
abuse and the effects of it and whatnot
 
05:04:02.150 --> 05:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
05:04:02.160 --> 05:04:03.350 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
chairman

05:04:03.350 --> 05:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:04:03.360 --> 05:04:04.368 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

05:04:04.368 --> 05:04:04.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:04.378 --> 05:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:08.690 --> 05:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
my my question is with the clear and
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence they don't just take
 
05:04:14.930 --> 05:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
Word of Mouth for evidence right you
 
05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
need like you need photos of of abuse or
 
05:04:20.570 --> 05:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
some type of documentation of financial
 
05:04:24.288 --> 05:04:24.298 align:start position:0%
abuse or something right uh if if my
 
05:04:26.530 --> 05:04:26.540 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct so
 
05:04:29.150 --> 05:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
say something happened you know 10 years
 
05:04:29.160 --> 05:04:30.430 align:start position:0%
say something happened you know 10 years
ago

05:04:30.430 --> 05:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
and the and the parties are like one one
 
05:04:37.730 --> 05:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
party's being more contentious during
 
05:04:40.010 --> 05:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
the divorce you couldn't be able to go
 
05:04:43.128 --> 05:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
back in time and say oh well you know
 
05:04:45.050 --> 05:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
they they're abusive they've been
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
showing abusive patterns because that's
 
05:04:49.128 --> 05:04:49.138 align:start position:0%
not clear and convincing evidence is my
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
understanding correct
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I mean somewhat I think you would
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
need to have more corroborating evidence
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
which is what I think you're you're
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
talking about in addition to somebody's
 
05:05:01.850 --> 05:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
testimony I mean testimony is very
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
powerful evidence in in a case of
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
somebody's experience
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
um but the corroborating evidence may be
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
required which is hard to come by when
 
05:05:12.350 --> 05:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
you have
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
um domestic abuse that is often behind
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
closed doors and so you often don't have
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
the advantage of having other witnesses
 
05:05:21.708 --> 05:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
to have seen
 
05:05:25.250 --> 05:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
um you know what's occurred so I do that
 
05:05:28.010 --> 05:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
is a concern what is also concerning is
 
05:05:30.770 --> 05:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
that we've never used that standard for
 
05:05:32.750 --> 05:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
for deciding what used to be called
 
05:05:36.170 --> 05:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
custody in 2005 we we replaced all of
 
05:05:38.330 --> 05:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
that language for a reason because we're
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
not talking about children as property
 
05:05:40.200 --> 05:05:41.628 align:start position:0%
not talking about children as property
anymore

05:05:41.628 --> 05:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
um but that's a standard that we've
 
05:05:46.128 --> 05:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
never used and it's very unusual in a
 
05:05:48.890 --> 05:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
civil case to use that standard
 
05:05:50.628 --> 05:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
um you know that I can't even off the
 
05:05:52.490 --> 05:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
top of my head think of when that
 
05:05:55.368 --> 05:05:55.378 align:start position:0%
standard comes into play in civil
 
05:05:55.378 --> 05:05:56.510 align:start position:0%
standard comes into play in civil
matters

05:05:56.510 --> 05:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
matters
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
05:06:02.330 --> 05:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you so
 
05:06:04.610 --> 05:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question what is the
 
05:06:07.128 --> 05:06:07.138 align:start position:0%
current standard in family court cases
 
05:06:09.430 --> 05:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about
 
05:06:13.128 --> 05:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
parenting time or allegations of you
 
05:06:14.390 --> 05:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
know domestic violence or other
 
05:06:16.910 --> 05:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
allegations it's a preponderance of the
 
05:06:18.890 --> 05:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
evidence which means more likely than
 
05:06:18.900 --> 05:06:20.330 align:start position:0%
evidence which means more likely than
not

05:06:20.330 --> 05:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:06:25.390 --> 05:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
and under 461a
 
05:06:30.650 --> 05:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
throughout it references RSA 173b or
 
05:06:34.970 --> 05:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
um the child abuse statute those two
 
05:06:38.690 --> 05:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
statutes would that the court would use
 
05:06:40.250 --> 05:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
those statutes to Define what
 
05:06:42.830 --> 05:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
constitutes child abuse neglect or
 
05:06:44.690 --> 05:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
um and that you would have to prove by a
 
05:06:48.830 --> 05:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence that there
 
05:06:50.930 --> 05:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
was domestic violence or child abuse or
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
both present in order to
 
05:06:56.030 --> 05:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
05:06:58.550 --> 05:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
help the court to understand or decide
 
05:07:00.050 --> 05:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
that there would be something other than
 
05:07:02.510 --> 05:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
frequent and continuing contact the
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
Court's also looking at the safety of
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
the the abused parent the safety of the
 
05:07:08.990 --> 05:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
child in both and the effect of the
 
05:07:11.868 --> 05:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
abuse that that might have on the child
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not like a done deal if you
 
05:07:16.250 --> 05:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that there's been domestic
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
violence that under RSA 173b that
 
05:07:21.410 --> 05:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
there's going to be something less than
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
frequent and continuing contact you
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
still need to demonstrate why it's not
 
05:07:27.770 --> 05:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
in the child's best interest to have
 
05:07:30.770 --> 05:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
that contact with the abuser parent
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you Mr
 
05:07:33.360 --> 05:07:34.250 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you Mr
chairman

05:07:34.250 --> 05:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:07:36.830 --> 05:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
um so for people who aren't
 
05:07:38.990 --> 05:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
um you know frequently in court and get
 
05:07:40.490 --> 05:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
most of our information about court
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
cases from like television what's what
 
05:07:46.310 --> 05:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
is the significant difference that we
 
05:07:47.448 --> 05:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
need to know about the difference
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
between preponderance of the evidence
 
05:07:51.230 --> 05:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing and then the
 
05:07:52.850 --> 05:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
criminal statute of Beyond A Reasonable
 
05:07:55.310 --> 05:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
Doubt like how do I put those in line in
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
my brain so that I understand
 
05:08:00.590 --> 05:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
where each one falls on a Continuum of
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
evidence sure so preponderance of the
 
05:08:06.288 --> 05:08:06.298 align:start position:0%
evidence is like the easiest burden of
 
05:08:10.250 --> 05:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
proof it's more likely likely than not
 
05:08:12.288 --> 05:08:12.298 align:start position:0%
um Beyond A Reasonable Doubt is the
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
highest standard you know for a criminal
 
05:08:16.850 --> 05:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
case where if there's any doubt then
 
05:08:19.970 --> 05:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
you're not guilty so this is sort of in
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
between those two it's and that's the
 
05:08:24.170 --> 05:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
best way I can describe it I think
 
05:08:26.330 --> 05:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
there's some subjectivity to that but
 
05:08:29.208 --> 05:08:29.218 align:start position:0%
that's the best way to describe it
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:36.470 --> 05:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you for your
 
05:08:47.810 --> 05:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:50.208 --> 05:08:50.218 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again Mr chairman for the
 
05:08:52.310 --> 05:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
record again my name is Dana Albrecht
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
from Nashua
 
05:08:57.288 --> 05:08:57.298 align:start position:0%
um I'd actually like to begin by just
 
05:08:58.970 --> 05:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
rebutting a couple things I heard
 
05:08:58.980 --> 05:09:01.250 align:start position:0%
rebutting a couple things I heard
earlier

05:09:01.250 --> 05:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:09:01.260 --> 05:09:02.208 align:start position:0%
earlier
um

05:09:02.208 --> 05:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:06.350 --> 05:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
I think right now the in practice in
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
these abuse cases the plaintiff is
 
05:09:11.448 --> 05:09:11.458 align:start position:0%
presumed to be right with no notice to
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
the defendant until somebody shows
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise and I believe also in practice
 
05:09:19.788 --> 05:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
and some of these abuse cases we let in
 
05:09:22.910 --> 05:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
multiple levels of totem hearsay so
 
05:09:25.788 --> 05:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
they're really in practice isn't an
 
05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
evidentiary standard
 
05:09:31.128 --> 05:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
and so these statutes can be used as a
 
05:09:34.250 --> 05:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
weapon in uh whenever you have
 
05:09:37.190 --> 05:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
reciprocal hostility between divorced
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
parents in a high conflict case
 
05:09:42.770 --> 05:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh particularly with the amendment I
 
05:09:44.810 --> 05:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
think this abuse addresses the abuse
 
05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
very clearly nobody is saying that an
 
05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
abusive parent shown to be abusive
 
05:09:55.368 --> 05:09:55.378 align:start position:0%
should have 50 50 nor does this bill do
 
05:09:57.470 --> 05:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
that and so I think we're chasing a red
 
05:10:01.070 --> 05:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
herring with the abuse issue
 
05:10:04.250 --> 05:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh with that said I would just say our
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
state has lofty ideals
 
05:10:09.170 --> 05:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
empowering rights are protected under
 
05:10:12.770 --> 05:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
Article 2 of our state constitution we
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
have case law describing a spirit of
 
05:10:17.448 --> 05:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
equality that pervades the entire state
 
05:10:20.650 --> 05:10:20.660 align:start position:0%
constitution the reality on the ground
 
05:10:25.550 --> 05:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
with parenting is that's not the case
 
05:10:27.770 --> 05:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
um jumping ahead to testimony we heard
 
05:10:27.780 --> 05:10:29.628 align:start position:0%
um jumping ahead to testimony we heard
earlier

05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:10:35.208 --> 05:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
we've got 127k backlog of cases we've
 
05:10:38.030 --> 05:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
got overworked judges
 
05:10:40.550 --> 05:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
I've sat through a five-day parenting
 
05:10:43.730 --> 05:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
hearing not my case where we're arguing
 
05:10:43.740 --> 05:10:45.050 align:start position:0%
hearing not my case where we're arguing
about

05:10:45.050 --> 05:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:10:50.208 --> 05:10:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:54.650 --> 05:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
is being litigated and that's stupid
 
05:10:57.288 --> 05:10:57.298 align:start position:0%
you should come into court and a judge
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
should ask do we have an agreement and
 
05:11:01.368 --> 05:11:01.378 align:start position:0%
if the parents have an agreement we're
 
05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
done now we're off the 127k date
 
05:11:04.920 --> 05:11:06.430 align:start position:0%
done now we're off the 127k date
docket

05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
docket
 
05:11:10.010 --> 05:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
and if the answer to that is no then the
 
05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
judge should say can anybody give me a
 
05:11:14.990 --> 05:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
good reason why I shouldn't award 50 50
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
parenting time
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
and if the answer to that is no
 
05:11:22.010 --> 05:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
congratulations we're off the docket
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
gets rid of the backlog
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
and if the answer to that is yes
 
05:11:30.050 --> 05:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
then somebody should start talking one
 
05:11:32.770 --> 05:11:32.780 align:start position:0%
of the two parties with some valid
 
05:11:34.910 --> 05:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
reasons and whether the evidence you're
 
05:11:36.890 --> 05:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
standing at that point is preponderance
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
or clear and convincing you know you can
 
05:11:42.530 --> 05:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
exec that out
 
05:11:44.930 --> 05:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
um but if we just have a presumption
 
05:11:47.390 --> 05:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
that this is how we're doing it absent a
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
good reason to do otherwise we can clear
 
05:11:52.550 --> 05:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
the docket and I would just finish that
 
05:11:53.990 --> 05:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
this would have gone
 
05:11:56.690 --> 05:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
a long way towards preventing the
 
05:11:58.970 --> 05:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
tragedy of my own case
 
05:12:01.490 --> 05:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
and to address what other states are
 
05:12:03.890 --> 05:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
doing what other states are doing right
 
05:12:03.900 --> 05:12:04.910 align:start position:0%
doing what other states are doing right
now

05:12:04.910 --> 05:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:12:07.010 --> 05:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
you know California Michigan multiple
 
05:12:08.930 --> 05:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
other states is trying to figure out
 
05:12:13.550 --> 05:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:13.560 --> 05:12:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:17.570 --> 05:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
because we didn't get it right from the
 
05:12:17.580 --> 05:12:18.770 align:start position:0%
because we didn't get it right from the
beginning

05:12:18.770 --> 05:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
05:12:22.190 --> 05:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
and if we just have this I wouldn't be
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
in a six and a half year protracted
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
court case and so let's pass this and
 
05:12:30.050 --> 05:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
just make it easy and clear the docket
 
05:12:32.570 --> 05:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
that happy to take questions any
 
05:12:32.580 --> 05:12:34.788 align:start position:0%
that happy to take questions any
questions

05:13:18.288 --> 05:13:18.298 align:start position:0%
what my comments are are really into in
 
05:13:20.208 --> 05:13:20.218 align:start position:0%
in drafting comments
 
05:13:23.690 --> 05:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
um so for example
 
05:13:23.700 --> 05:13:24.770 align:start position:0%
um so for example
um

05:13:24.770 --> 05:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about the bill is
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
introduced and I did
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
um I was I was uh I was able to get a
 
05:13:32.330 --> 05:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment and I have a
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
couple thoughts on the amendment I think
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment is an improvement
 
05:13:38.448 --> 05:13:38.458 align:start position:0%
um in terms of of drafting
 
05:13:41.448 --> 05:13:41.458 align:start position:0%
um but on the original bill on lines
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
four to five it references in accordance
 
05:13:47.110 --> 05:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
with the best interests of the child
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
pursuant to our say 461 a colon 2 1A
 
05:13:53.810 --> 05:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
that's a very narrow
 
05:13:56.750 --> 05:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
um definition of best interest of the of
 
05:14:00.110 --> 05:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
the child if if that was to be used
 
05:14:00.120 --> 05:14:01.628 align:start position:0%
the child if if that was to be used
um 169

05:14:01.628 --> 05:14:01.638 align:start position:0%
um 169
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
a21 a
 
05:14:07.550 --> 05:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
is excuse me
 
05:14:10.010 --> 05:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
um simply says support frequent and
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
continued contact between child and both
 
05:14:13.850 --> 05:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
parents that's not the full definition
 
05:14:16.930 --> 05:14:16.940 align:start position:0%
of best interest of the of the child
 
05:14:20.270 --> 05:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
and really that should be a reference to
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:26.690 --> 05:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
um 461 A6 which is the definition of
 
05:14:29.770 --> 05:14:29.780 align:start position:0%
best interests of the child
 
05:14:33.948 --> 05:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
in most of the rest of of the first part
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
of section one and the amendment it
 
05:14:38.628 --> 05:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
references equal parenting time so we
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
have a lot of words in 461 a we have
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
decision making responsibility we have
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities we
 
05:14:49.250 --> 05:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
have parenting schedule and we have
 
05:14:51.770 --> 05:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
residential responsibility we do not
 
05:14:54.650 --> 05:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
currently have equal parenting time so
 
05:14:56.510 --> 05:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
now we have a new phrase that's being
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
introduced in into the mix of things
 
05:15:01.550 --> 05:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
we all may say well we know we all know
 
05:15:03.288 --> 05:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
at equal parenting time that's sort of
 
05:15:05.448 --> 05:15:05.458 align:start position:0%
obvious if we all tried to write down
 
05:15:07.250 --> 05:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
separately what equal parenting time
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
means that might be something different
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
and now a judge is going to be
 
05:15:12.770 --> 05:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
interpreting that there is no definition
 
05:15:15.410 --> 05:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
contained here uh as to what equal
 
05:15:18.850 --> 05:15:18.860 align:start position:0%
parenting time means so for example
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
Concord school district has 177 days in
 
05:15:24.770 --> 05:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
the school year so that sort of tends to
 
05:15:24.780 --> 05:15:25.610 align:start position:0%
the school year so that sort of tends to
get

05:15:25.610 --> 05:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:15:27.890 --> 05:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
boxed up with with one parent or another
 
05:15:30.890 --> 05:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
depending on their their geography you
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
know what does it mean when we're
 
05:15:34.490 --> 05:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
talking about equal parenting time as
 
05:15:36.050 --> 05:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
compared to parental rights and
 
05:15:38.810 --> 05:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
responsibilities or when we're talking
 
05:15:41.690 --> 05:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
about residential responsibility because
 
05:15:43.730 --> 05:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
one of the statute one of the rules of
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
statutory construction is well we're
 
05:15:46.970 --> 05:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
using a different word so we must mean
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
something different it's not clear what
 
05:15:52.010 --> 05:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
it is we mean when we're when we're
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
using that that particular word
 
05:15:59.270 --> 05:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and we already have sort of policy
 
05:16:01.850 --> 05:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
goals that are stated in 461a we support
 
05:16:04.970 --> 05:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
frequent and continued contact we want
 
05:16:07.610 --> 05:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
to share the uh we want the both parents
 
05:16:09.470 --> 05:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
to share in rights and responsibilities
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
we want both parents to have joint
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
decision making and those are in the
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
best interests of the child so this just
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
adds another layer without a lot of
 
05:16:18.120 --> 05:16:21.470 align:start position:0%
adds another layer without a lot of
definition

05:16:21.470 --> 05:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.480 --> 05:16:22.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:16:22.610 --> 05:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:25.368 --> 05:16:25.378 align:start position:0%
in the bill is introduced which I
 
05:16:27.050 --> 05:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
believe is if I'm reading it correctly
 
05:16:29.810 --> 05:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
and the amendment is taken out which I
 
05:16:31.610 --> 05:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
appreciate I think is a very good move
 
05:16:34.128 --> 05:16:34.138 align:start position:0%
on page two of the bill is introduced
 
05:16:36.430 --> 05:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
lines 4 through 12
 
05:16:39.890 --> 05:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
talks about access to records and what
 
05:16:43.128 --> 05:16:43.138 align:start position:0%
happens if access is denied and it says
 
05:16:45.890 --> 05:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
upon on line seven upon the written
 
05:16:48.288 --> 05:16:48.298 align:start position:0%
request of a of the parent the court
 
05:16:50.750 --> 05:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
shell upon its finding that the
 
05:16:52.610 --> 05:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
individual professional public and
 
05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
private institution organization has
 
05:16:57.288 --> 05:16:57.298 align:start position:0%
denied such requests without cause order
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
that party to stop doing stuff and to
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
award fees that is not a party in the
 
05:17:05.448 --> 05:17:05.458 align:start position:0%
litigation it's it's somebody who is
 
05:17:08.030 --> 05:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
external to the court and this would
 
05:17:10.128 --> 05:17:10.138 align:start position:0%
require us to make findings to somebody
 
05:17:12.288 --> 05:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
who's not involved in a proceeding in
 
05:17:14.330 --> 05:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
front of the court that is not something
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
the court can do and then sort of they
 
05:17:19.070 --> 05:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't have an opportunity to present to
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
talk to do anything but orders are being
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
issued again them apparently without
 
05:17:26.810 --> 05:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
their knowledge I believe that is that
 
05:17:28.610 --> 05:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
is corrected in the amendment by simply
 
05:17:31.970 --> 05:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
dropping that part of it out
 
05:17:31.980 --> 05:17:35.288 align:start position:0%
dropping that part of it out
um

05:17:35.288 --> 05:17:35.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
in uh in both the amendment and the bill
 
05:17:41.690 --> 05:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk about the
 
05:17:44.090 --> 05:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced
 
05:17:44.100 --> 05:17:45.288 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced
um

05:17:45.288 --> 05:17:45.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
lines 14 to 15 talks about if you go to
 
05:17:50.570 --> 05:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
the introduction the presumption that
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
equal parenting time per calendar year
 
05:17:54.650 --> 05:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the child may
 
05:17:55.970 --> 05:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
be rebutted
 
05:17:58.670 --> 05:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
and then 14 and 15 says if one of the
 
05:18:01.368 --> 05:18:01.378 align:start position:0%
parties does not request sole primary or
 
05:18:05.208 --> 05:18:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:07.250 --> 05:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
that at least I have some troubles
 
05:18:09.170 --> 05:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
interpreting exactly what that means
 
05:18:11.930 --> 05:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about equal parenting
 
05:18:14.330 --> 05:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
time but one of the parties simply does
 
05:18:17.390 --> 05:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
not request sole primary joint that
 
05:18:20.330 --> 05:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
appears to be a rebut to equal parenting
 
05:18:22.670 --> 05:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
time and truthfully I'm just confused as
 
05:18:25.970 --> 05:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
as to exactly how that would be applied
 
05:18:29.330 --> 05:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
in in terms of of a court trying to
 
05:18:33.890 --> 05:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.900 --> 05:18:37.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:18:37.250 --> 05:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:39.230 --> 05:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
and with that I would conclude my
 
05:18:40.550 --> 05:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
comments but be happy to answer any
 
05:18:40.560 --> 05:18:41.810 align:start position:0%
comments but be happy to answer any
questions

05:18:41.810 --> 05:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:18:44.930 --> 05:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Nelson
 
05:18:47.570 --> 05:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:18:49.128 --> 05:18:49.138 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:18:49.138 --> 05:18:50.390 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:55.310 --> 05:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
is there any way we can find out data on
 
05:18:55.320 --> 05:18:57.948 align:start position:0%
is there any way we can find out data on
um

05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:02.750 --> 05:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
how much time presently is awarded like
 
05:19:04.190 --> 05:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't know exactly how to word this
 
05:19:07.788 --> 05:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
question but um so we don't so okay yeah
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
you probably know what I'm I'm asking so
 
05:19:13.550 --> 05:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question we do not
 
05:19:16.368 --> 05:19:16.378 align:start position:0%
in our database have a way of extracting
 
05:19:20.868 --> 05:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
out orders of of time awarded so it we
 
05:19:22.490 --> 05:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
don't have a database that we could
 
05:19:24.170 --> 05:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
extract that from simply because that
 
05:19:27.230 --> 05:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
data is not inputted into it we know how
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
many cases are filed we know
 
05:19:32.990 --> 05:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
um you know some limited data but we we
 
05:19:34.850 --> 05:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
don't input all of the data from an
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
order into into our database so then we
 
05:19:41.650 --> 05:19:41.660 align:start position:0%
can't extract it okay thank you
 
05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
05:19:46.368 --> 05:19:46.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:19:46.378 --> 05:19:52.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
taking

05:19:52.430 --> 05:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:54.970 --> 05:19:54.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:58.910 --> 05:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
defined equal parenting and what that
 
05:19:58.920 --> 05:20:00.410 align:start position:0%
defined equal parenting and what that
means

05:20:00.410 --> 05:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
means
 
05:20:01.850 --> 05:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I did
 
05:20:03.410 --> 05:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
not look I only looked at the New
 
05:20:05.030 --> 05:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statutes to see if there was a
 
05:20:07.490 --> 05:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
definition I did not look if there are
 
05:20:09.170 --> 05:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
definitions around the country and if
 
05:20:10.368 --> 05:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
they're the same
 
05:20:13.610 --> 05:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:13.620 --> 05:20:18.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:20:18.430 --> 05:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.730 --> 05:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.090 --> 05:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Ed
 
05:20:26.100 --> 05:20:28.128 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Ed
um

05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:28.138 --> 05:20:29.470 align:start position:0%
um
in

05:20:29.470 --> 05:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:20:29.480 --> 05:20:31.128 align:start position:0%
in
2005

05:20:31.128 --> 05:20:31.138 align:start position:0%
2005
 
05:20:32.930 --> 05:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
we passed
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
presumption in favor of shared parenting
 
05:20:35.040 --> 05:20:36.650 align:start position:0%
presumption in favor of shared parenting
rights

05:20:36.650 --> 05:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
rights
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh bill you know one of the differences
 
05:20:41.330 --> 05:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
was do we use the definition of
 
05:20:43.730 --> 05:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
comparable instead of equal use the
 
05:20:45.850 --> 05:20:45.860 align:start position:0%
words comparable would that be
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
helpful that passed the committee four
 
05:20:53.448 --> 05:20:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
I I think the if if you use the same
 
05:20:58.670 --> 05:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
words that we've used before those tend
 
05:21:01.670 --> 05:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
to have had some some time to be
 
05:21:03.890 --> 05:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
interpreted I'm not sure exactly and I
 
05:21:05.810 --> 05:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
apologize exactly what change you would
 
05:21:07.310 --> 05:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
be proposing
 
05:21:09.050 --> 05:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
you instead of equal you would say
 
05:21:11.330 --> 05:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
comparable yeah utilizing the word
 
05:21:13.850 --> 05:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
comparable as opposed to equal that's
 
05:21:16.368 --> 05:21:16.378 align:start position:0%
that's the difference I can see
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
between the two bills in 2005 and the
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
one now
 
05:21:23.448 --> 05:21:23.458 align:start position:0%
um and yeah truthfully
 
05:21:24.948 --> 05:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
um I would have to think about it I
 
05:21:26.690 --> 05:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the I haven't looked
 
05:21:28.550 --> 05:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
at how comparable has been interpreted
 
05:21:32.570 --> 05:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
in that context I and if I may I'd like
 
05:21:36.410 --> 05:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
your remark can I have your written
 
05:21:38.750 --> 05:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
document of your remarks and I've got
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
script I'll take some copy pen scratch
 
05:21:43.250 --> 05:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
notes notes well can you do them over
 
05:21:46.070 --> 05:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
that and submit them to the chairman for
 
05:21:48.830 --> 05:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
us to review I can certainly try because
 
05:21:49.970 --> 05:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
I thought you had a lot of good
 
05:21:52.490 --> 05:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
information in there I know I'm happy to
 
05:21:54.650 --> 05:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
try to put it into a into an email today
 
05:22:00.430 --> 05:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:22:09.948 --> 05:22:09.958 align:start position:0%
I am admittedly new to all of this so I
 
05:22:12.650 --> 05:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
would just like to question since the
 
05:22:14.810 --> 05:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
um not able to Define equal is there a
 
05:22:19.010 --> 05:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
reason why we just don't say 50 50
 
05:22:21.650 --> 05:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
parenting so so thank you for the
 
05:22:23.628 --> 05:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
question I I think the you know
 
05:22:26.628 --> 05:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
conceptually equal means equal and I
 
05:22:29.208 --> 05:22:29.218 align:start position:0%
understand what equal means does it is
 
05:22:31.610 --> 05:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
it everybody has to have the same number
 
05:22:35.330 --> 05:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
of hours is it time spent with the child
 
05:22:38.570 --> 05:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily residential who's
 
05:22:41.990 --> 05:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
keeping track of the time so if
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
you know equal is is a great word
 
05:22:49.250 --> 05:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
equal what is it is it you know it's
 
05:22:50.750 --> 05:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
probably not residential time because
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's just already sort of in the
 
05:22:55.010 --> 05:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
statute as something we're supposed to
 
05:22:58.368 --> 05:22:58.378 align:start position:0%
aspire to it's you know it's is it
 
05:23:00.530 --> 05:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
what's the other word
 
05:23:00.540 --> 05:23:02.030 align:start position:0%
what's the other word
um

05:23:02.030 --> 05:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:02.040 --> 05:23:03.708 align:start position:0%
um
oops

05:23:03.708 --> 05:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
oops
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
hold on I've lost my place now I have a
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
clip that's my problem
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
um is it so we we already have sort of
 
05:23:19.730 --> 05:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:22.850 --> 05:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
um frequent and continuous contact and
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
residential responsibility so if equal
 
05:23:28.730 --> 05:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be essentially
 
05:23:30.170 --> 05:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
are we talking residential
 
05:23:33.190 --> 05:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility so that we're equal time
 
05:23:37.490 --> 05:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
in in the in the respect of homes
 
05:23:39.770 --> 05:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's fine if that's what's
 
05:23:43.368 --> 05:23:43.378 align:start position:0%
meant just say it uh if it is time spent
 
05:23:46.610 --> 05:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
with with the child okay then then I
 
05:23:48.890 --> 05:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
think just say that and then sort of how
 
05:23:51.050 --> 05:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
do we measure that
 
05:23:51.060 --> 05:23:52.368 align:start position:0%
do we measure that
um

05:23:52.368 --> 05:23:52.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:54.170 --> 05:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
or is it something else and I don't know
 
05:23:56.330 --> 05:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
what the something else would be
 
05:23:58.368 --> 05:23:58.378 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's just a question of
 
05:24:00.110 --> 05:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
saying what are we what are we making
 
05:24:02.330 --> 05:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
equal what's the what what's the math
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
formula look like to come up with 50 50.
 
05:24:09.170 --> 05:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so if this was
 
05:24:12.890 --> 05:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
clarified to say equal time with parents
 
05:24:16.368 --> 05:24:16.378 align:start position:0%
and not that other frequent visiting if
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
it said these are the options you either
 
05:24:22.910 --> 05:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
go to a five two five two schedule or a
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
um two two three schedule or so that we
 
05:24:27.650 --> 05:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
know that in a month of 30 days it's 15
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
days you're with Mom and 15 days with
 
05:24:33.410 --> 05:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
Dad and how mom and dad decide whether
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to go every other week or
 
05:24:37.128 --> 05:24:37.138 align:start position:0%
whether you're going to make up time
 
05:24:40.128 --> 05:24:40.138 align:start position:0%
in the summer or but somehow
 
05:24:42.410 --> 05:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
the days of the year are divided and you
 
05:24:45.410 --> 05:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
spend equal amounts of time when you
 
05:24:47.930 --> 05:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
look at the overall year
 
05:24:49.970 --> 05:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
um if it's at all possible because then
 
05:24:52.190 --> 05:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
when you I guess when I look down and I
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
see where it says what you were
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
questioning about unless one party says
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
they can't do it and they're not looking
 
05:24:59.570 --> 05:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
for that it could be that that person
 
05:25:01.610 --> 05:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
lives out of state they're working out
 
05:25:03.470 --> 05:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
of state or for some reason can't take
 
05:25:05.930 --> 05:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
it on so I could see where what that
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
would mean but
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the bill would be
 
05:25:12.770 --> 05:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
good if we could just Define that one
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
um equal parenting what exactly is that
 
05:25:16.970 --> 05:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question and and
 
05:25:18.288 --> 05:25:18.298 align:start position:0%
whether you define it or not the
 
05:25:19.970 --> 05:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
question is whether you want to have
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
control of that definition or if you
 
05:25:24.230 --> 05:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
want that to sort of evolve over time
 
05:25:25.610 --> 05:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
um with the court system they're going
 
05:25:27.170 --> 05:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
to have to Define this because there's
 
05:25:29.448 --> 05:25:29.458 align:start position:0%
not something more specific in in the
 
05:25:29.458 --> 05:25:30.350 align:start position:0%
not something more specific in in the
bill

05:25:30.350 --> 05:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:25:32.510 --> 05:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
 
05:25:34.910 --> 05:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:25:37.550 --> 05:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
you again for taking my next question
 
05:25:40.010 --> 05:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
um with that being said about
 
05:25:42.110 --> 05:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
um struggling to fund a definition of
 
05:25:45.288 --> 05:25:45.298 align:start position:0%
equal time what is the definition of
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
frequent because that's that's not a an
 
05:25:51.890 --> 05:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
exact measure as well so how does the
 
05:25:53.690 --> 05:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
how does the court determine exactly
 
05:25:55.910 --> 05:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
what frequent is
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
truthfully did not poll or look into
 
05:26:01.368 --> 05:26:01.378 align:start position:0%
that before coming here today so I don't
 
05:26:03.230 --> 05:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
have a I don't know off the top of my
 
05:26:03.240 --> 05:26:07.610 align:start position:0%
have a I don't know off the top of my
head

05:26:07.610 --> 05:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:09.770 --> 05:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
seeing No Hands hearing no voices thank
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony I think you'll
 
05:26:14.150 --> 05:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
look forward to that transcription from
 
05:26:17.390 --> 05:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:22.970 --> 05:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:22.980 --> 05:26:33.010 align:start position:0%

05:26:33.010 --> 05:26:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:35.930 --> 05:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony as a
 
05:26:37.850 --> 05:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
person who's extremely concerned about
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse and how it is handled in
 
05:26:40.798 --> 05:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse and how it is handled in
court

05:26:41.830 --> 05:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
court
 
05:26:45.470 --> 05:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
I may sound unusual in that I really
 
05:26:47.090 --> 05:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
05:26:50.690 --> 05:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
for multiple reasons currently there is
 
05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
no requisite requirement for a judge to
 
05:26:56.690 --> 05:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
consider domestic abuse or even any
 
05:26:58.730 --> 05:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
other reason why somebody should not
 
05:27:03.530 --> 05:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
have parenting rights uh a protracted
 
05:27:06.770 --> 05:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
Court hearings have been reduced in the
 
05:27:09.410 --> 05:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
states that have adopted equal shared
 
05:27:12.650 --> 05:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
parenting they have been reduced over 50
 
05:27:16.490 --> 05:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
percent in fact in one state if they
 
05:27:18.128 --> 05:27:18.138 align:start position:0%
have actually
 
05:27:20.628 --> 05:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
an entire Law Firm
 
05:27:22.730 --> 05:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
that hired many people has gone out of
 
05:27:22.740 --> 05:27:23.990 align:start position:0%
that hired many people has gone out of
business

05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:27:29.390 --> 05:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
this this promise is to save parents a
 
05:27:32.208 --> 05:27:32.218 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money
 
05:27:34.550 --> 05:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
once you stop fighting about that's the
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
main thing I'm sorry I can't speak well
 
05:27:40.970 --> 05:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
but I'll just try to get my ideas across
 
05:27:44.170 --> 05:27:44.180 align:start position:0%
um that's really what mostly people uh
 
05:27:47.510 --> 05:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
protract their their legal fights over
 
05:27:49.788 --> 05:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
is their children the most valuable
 
05:27:52.128 --> 05:27:52.138 align:start position:0%
thing we have is our children
 
05:27:55.490 --> 05:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh so once you settle that
 
05:27:55.500 --> 05:27:56.208 align:start position:0%
uh so once you settle that
um

05:27:56.208 --> 05:27:56.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:59.708 --> 05:27:59.718 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot more to fight over
 
05:28:02.990 --> 05:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
with the great reduction in charges of
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence this also frees up our
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
agencies that investigate domestic
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
violence so that they have more time to
 
05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
investigate the ones that are are much
 
05:28:14.650 --> 05:28:14.660 align:start position:0%
more serious
 
05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I was really
 
05:28:20.628 --> 05:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about was how do you prove you
 
05:28:22.128 --> 05:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
know how do you prove there's domestic
 
05:28:22.138 --> 05:28:23.990 align:start position:0%
know how do you prove there's domestic
violence

05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
violence
 
05:28:26.090 --> 05:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
um currently like I said under current
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
rules we all know hard Tails where it
 
05:28:31.368 --> 05:28:31.378 align:start position:0%
wasn't even considered
 
05:28:33.890 --> 05:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
the judge just decided that one person
 
05:28:36.410 --> 05:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
would get a hundred percent of the of
 
05:28:37.850 --> 05:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:28:40.850 --> 05:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
of the custody and they didn't have to
 
05:28:43.788 --> 05:28:43.798 align:start position:0%
consider the whether that was safe or
 
05:28:47.270 --> 05:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
not so worse came to worse they would
 
05:28:50.810 --> 05:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
give a child to a domestic abuser 50 of
 
05:28:52.490 --> 05:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
the time right now it's happening a
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
hundred percent so the burden of proof
 
05:28:58.310 --> 05:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
that isn't some esoteric thing out in
 
05:29:00.770 --> 05:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
the clouds there's some genuine concrete
 
05:29:03.650 --> 05:29:03.660 align:start position:0%
ways that you can determine whether a
 
05:29:06.050 --> 05:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
parent is not safe for a child to live
 
05:29:08.810 --> 05:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
with and that there's a history a
 
05:29:11.030 --> 05:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
history of crimes and assault and DV
 
05:29:14.208 --> 05:29:14.218 align:start position:0%
that's that's recorded
 
05:29:17.810 --> 05:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
um you can read court documents to see
 
05:29:22.550 --> 05:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
if there's uh conditions like um is
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
there a place for the child to actually
 
05:29:27.230 --> 05:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
stay with this person
 
05:29:29.330 --> 05:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
um is there safe housing
 
05:29:32.330 --> 05:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh are the or the parent have they ever
 
05:29:35.090 --> 05:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
shown any kind of behavior that sounds
 
05:29:38.030 --> 05:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
like they really aren't aren't up to
 
05:29:38.040 --> 05:29:39.770 align:start position:0%
like they really aren't aren't up to
Priority

05:29:39.770 --> 05:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
Priority
 
05:29:39.780 --> 05:29:40.788 align:start position:0%
Priority
um

05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
then there's also medical records
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
because if this person is an abuser
 
05:29:48.050 --> 05:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
there should be some medical records
 
05:29:50.510 --> 05:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
because they've hurt somebody
 
05:29:54.890 --> 05:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm kind of Riley amused at not being
 
05:29:57.288 --> 05:29:57.298 align:start position:0%
able to just discern what 50 50
 
05:29:59.390 --> 05:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
parenting is
 
05:30:02.510 --> 05:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
coming from a mathematical background my
 
05:30:04.610 --> 05:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
background is engineering
 
05:30:04.620 --> 05:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
background is engineering
equal

05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
equal
 
05:30:08.030 --> 05:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
is 50 50.
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
so I really think that's not hard to to
 
05:30:13.610 --> 05:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
determine and it's nice to give the
 
05:30:16.010 --> 05:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
parents some flexibility to figure out
 
05:30:19.368 --> 05:30:19.378 align:start position:0%
how to do those 15 days per month that's
 
05:30:21.050 --> 05:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
fine we don't have to tell them exactly
 
05:30:24.170 --> 05:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
but we have to say that is the goal
 
05:30:27.470 --> 05:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate very much your attention
 
05:30:29.868 --> 05:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and are there
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:36.288 --> 05:30:36.298 align:start position:0%
thank you I do not see any so thank you
 
05:30:38.930 --> 05:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
very much and the chair recognizes Ed
 
05:30:38.940 --> 05:30:53.448 align:start position:0%
very much and the chair recognizes Ed
Brian's

05:30:53.448 --> 05:30:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:56.150 --> 05:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable committee my name is
 
05:30:57.708 --> 05:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
Ed Bryans I'm from Marlboro New
 
05:30:57.718 --> 05:30:59.810 align:start position:0%
Ed Bryans I'm from Marlboro New
Hampshire

05:30:59.810 --> 05:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:31:02.628 --> 05:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
um I respect this committee's time
 
05:31:04.368 --> 05:31:04.378 align:start position:0%
um I'm so happy to hear some of the
 
05:31:06.650 --> 05:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
people of Representative gay going over
 
05:31:09.410 --> 05:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
the drop in domestic violence claims
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
from the states of Kentucky West
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
Virginia and Arkansas that all have a
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
shared parenting bill
 
05:31:17.810 --> 05:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
um they're lawyers and judges can now
 
05:31:21.610 --> 05:31:21.620 align:start position:0%
address issues that are real
 
05:31:24.770 --> 05:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
I want to
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
teach this committee a couple coin
 
05:31:28.250 --> 05:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
phrases that some of us that have been
 
05:31:31.128 --> 05:31:31.138 align:start position:0%
through the system use one of them will
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
be called false domestic violence claims
 
05:31:35.930 --> 05:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
the Silver Bullet the Silver Bullet is
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
when a claim is made parenting time is
 
05:31:40.730 --> 05:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
taken away from one person or the other
 
05:31:43.070 --> 05:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
and it sets the pace for the final
 
05:31:45.170 --> 05:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
outcome of a hearing
 
05:31:48.410 --> 05:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
the other uh coin phrase we we use is
 
05:31:52.128 --> 05:31:52.138 align:start position:0%
being a Disneyland Dad when a father who
 
05:31:54.590 --> 05:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
is fit for every other weekend to visit
 
05:31:56.270 --> 05:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
with his child
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
only has four days a month with that
 
05:32:01.490 --> 05:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
child you don't spend that time working
 
05:32:03.890 --> 05:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
on a child's homework uh teaching them
 
05:32:06.288 --> 05:32:06.298 align:start position:0%
discipline giving them chores normal
 
05:32:09.170 --> 05:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
things that a father maybe would do but
 
05:32:10.850 --> 05:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
instead you want to make that four days
 
05:32:13.550 --> 05:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
a month as enjoyable and fun with that
 
05:32:17.390 --> 05:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
child and you're gonna allow it you're
 
05:32:19.490 --> 05:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
gonna spoil the kid so you end up
 
05:32:22.010 --> 05:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
raising a spoiled child
 
05:32:25.788 --> 05:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
um again 10 years ago I went through a
 
05:32:27.770 --> 05:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
family court matter
 
05:32:31.670 --> 05:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
um the end result was 50 50.
 
05:32:33.890 --> 05:32:33.900 align:start position:0%
um here I am 10 years later with a 15
 
05:32:36.170 --> 05:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
year old daughter that I am so grateful
 
05:32:38.150 --> 05:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
to share time with her mother because
 
05:32:41.330 --> 05:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
boy she has a lot of drama
 
05:32:45.948 --> 05:32:45.958 align:start position:0%
um but we don't at this point look at
 
05:32:47.868 --> 05:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
she stays an extra day at Mom's house
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
she's got a sports event she doesn't get
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
back till late you know it's 59 41
 
05:32:55.250 --> 05:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
percent and maybe 30 percent one week it
 
05:32:57.410 --> 05:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
may be 75 percent another
 
05:33:00.050 --> 05:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
but the the fact is is that the mother
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
and I communicate
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
and we do what's best for our child
 
05:33:07.310 --> 05:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
going into the family court Arena that's
 
05:33:09.830 --> 05:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what it was it was drag all the
 
05:33:11.930 --> 05:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
dirty laundry all the most negative
 
05:33:13.550 --> 05:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
things we can find about each other
 
05:33:16.010 --> 05:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
because the system is set up to be a
 
05:33:17.390 --> 05:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
winner take all
 
05:33:22.670 --> 05:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
and he that wins the prize has the child
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm very different than my co-parent
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
my ex is very organized very methodical
 
05:33:32.390 --> 05:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
I may be a little bit more adventurous
 
05:33:32.400 --> 05:33:33.230 align:start position:0%
I may be a little bit more adventurous
um

05:33:33.230 --> 05:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:39.050 --> 05:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:40.910 --> 05:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
I've been involved a little bit with the
 
05:33:43.310 --> 05:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
political Arena my daughter surprised me
 
05:33:44.330 --> 05:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
one day
 
05:33:46.010 --> 05:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
um put her name in and ran for and
 
05:33:48.470 --> 05:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
became the school president she's the

hurt but she's adventurous she's strong
 
05:33:58.490 --> 05:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
she's determined but she's also
 
05:34:00.590 --> 05:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
organized like her mother
 
05:34:04.250 --> 05:34:04.260 align:start position:0%

support this bill and finally see it go

05:35:40.368 --> 05:35:40.378 align:start position:0%
you committee for having me today I'm
 
05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
going to start my name is Laura tolerski
 
05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm represent Hillsborough 11 which is
 
05:35:46.310 --> 05:35:46.320 align:start position:0%

05:35:48.650 --> 05:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
right off by telling you that I have
 
05:35:50.330 --> 05:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
communicated with the chair and vice
 
05:35:50.340 --> 05:35:51.410 align:start position:0%
communicated with the chair and vice
chair

05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:35:53.330 --> 05:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
um that I hope the committee will
 
05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
consider retaining this bill
 
05:35:58.550 --> 05:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
um to learn more about the issue I know
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
that the language is written in this
 
05:36:02.830 --> 05:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
bill is not going to solve the problem
 
05:36:05.208 --> 05:36:05.218 align:start position:0%
and I think that can save us a whole lot
 
05:36:08.810 --> 05:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
of time here if we just take that bill
 
05:36:10.490 --> 05:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:36:12.770 --> 05:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
stop looking at the text but just use
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to learn a little bit
 
05:36:16.070 --> 05:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
more about special immigrant juvenile
 
05:36:18.530 --> 05:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
status and what the problem might be so
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
I hope you can um
 
05:36:22.430 --> 05:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
take a minute to listen to me while I
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit of background
 
05:36:24.770 --> 05:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
about how this came about and then I
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
know that there's people who are going
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:32.270 --> 05:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
um unmarried citizen non-citizen youth
 
05:36:34.128 --> 05:36:34.138 align:start position:0%
under the age of 21 in the U.S can be
 
05:36:36.230 --> 05:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
classified under federal law as special
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
immigrant juveniles Congress created
 
05:36:40.490 --> 05:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
this classification for vulnerable youth
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
who have been abused neglected or
 
05:36:45.110 --> 05:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
abandoned by one or both parents or
 
05:36:47.208 --> 05:36:47.218 align:start position:0%
their guardian and whose best interests
 
05:36:49.310 --> 05:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
are served by not being returned to
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
their country and instead remaining in
 
05:36:52.550 --> 05:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
the care and custody of the nominated
 
05:36:52.560 --> 05:36:53.930 align:start position:0%
the care and custody of the nominated
Guardian

05:36:53.930 --> 05:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
Guardian
 
05:36:56.570 --> 05:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
sij classification and protection has
 
05:36:59.090 --> 05:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
been available since 1990 when Congress
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
passed a law to assist these youth with
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
obtaining lawful permanent residents
 
05:37:05.150 --> 05:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
through a special immigrant Visa this
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
classification itself does not Grant
 
05:37:10.070 --> 05:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
citizenship or even lawful residents
 
05:37:11.330 --> 05:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
and requesting this Federal
 
05:37:14.090 --> 05:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
classification as a two-part process our
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
own state courts are step one since it
 
05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
is the purview of the states to
 
05:37:19.788 --> 05:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
determine whether a child has been
 
05:37:22.368 --> 05:37:22.378 align:start position:0%
abused neglected or abandoned in what is
 
05:37:24.288 --> 05:37:24.298 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the child
 
05:37:27.050 --> 05:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
pursuing this status requires a Judicial
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
determination regarding the necessary
 
05:37:31.310 --> 05:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
criteria without the state court
 
05:37:33.530 --> 05:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
determination a youth cannot seek the
 
05:37:36.170 --> 05:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
federal law path to sij classification
 
05:37:38.930 --> 05:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
protection and stabilizing status
 
05:37:40.670 --> 05:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
after the state court findings are
 
05:37:43.070 --> 05:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
issued the second step is to then apply
 
05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
for this sij classification and it is
 
05:37:47.690 --> 05:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
the federal decision makers who review
 
05:37:50.510 --> 05:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
the application and make a determination
 
05:37:52.010 --> 05:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
in other words the federal government
 
05:37:54.470 --> 05:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
has the sole responsibility to regulate
 
05:37:56.390 --> 05:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
immigration but certain responsibilities
 
05:37:58.550 --> 05:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
have been given to the states such as
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
determinations regarding abused
 
05:38:02.810 --> 05:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
neglected and abandoned children it is
 
05:38:04.128 --> 05:38:04.138 align:start position:0%
the state court that must provide
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
factual findings about a vulnerable
 
05:38:06.000 --> 05:38:06.948 align:start position:0%
factual findings about a vulnerable
child

05:38:06.948 --> 05:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:38:09.170 --> 05:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
why did Congress give States this
 
05:38:09.180 --> 05:38:10.490 align:start position:0%
why did Congress give States this
responsibility

05:38:10.490 --> 05:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:38:12.170 --> 05:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
because the protection well-being and
 
05:38:13.490 --> 05:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
determining the best interest of
 
05:38:15.050 --> 05:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
children is directly in the Wheelhouse
 
05:38:17.628 --> 05:38:17.638 align:start position:0%
of our state courts
 
05:38:19.670 --> 05:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
it is important to remember the New
 
05:38:21.170 --> 05:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts are not giving these
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
children immigration status
 
05:38:24.590 --> 05:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding New Hampshire state
 
05:38:26.330 --> 05:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
court determinations regarding
 
05:38:28.010 --> 05:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
dependency or custody of young
 
05:38:30.170 --> 05:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
non-citizens they can still be denied
 
05:38:32.930 --> 05:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
sij classification but it is the federal
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
immigration authorities that will deny
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
or accept the special immigrant juvenile
 
05:38:39.110 --> 05:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
petition not the state
 
05:38:41.448 --> 05:38:41.458 align:start position:0%
Congress defers and relies on the states
 
05:38:43.730 --> 05:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
to make findings regarding dependency
 
05:38:45.590 --> 05:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
and custody of Youth and appropriate
 
05:38:47.628 --> 05:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
State Court proceedings through which
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
these vulnerable youth May seek these
 
05:38:50.160 --> 05:38:51.288 align:start position:0%
these vulnerable youth May seek these
findings

05:38:51.288 --> 05:38:51.298 align:start position:0%
findings
 
05:38:53.150 --> 05:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
so that's the background
 
05:38:55.010 --> 05:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
since learning about this issue and
 
05:38:56.628 --> 05:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
drafting the bill I've met with several
 
05:38:58.730 --> 05:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
immigrant attorneys and Advocates and
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
every one of them agrees that state law
 
05:39:03.170 --> 05:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
Provisions are needed to provide for
 
05:39:04.910 --> 05:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate proceedings and
 
05:39:06.590 --> 05:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
determinations for these vulnerable
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
youth and the new statutory provisions
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
and modifications must fit within the
 
05:39:13.850 --> 05:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire framework
 
05:39:16.070 --> 05:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
also since this bill was drafted
 
05:39:18.350 --> 05:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
information has come to light concerning
 
05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
issues arising in the adjudication of
 
05:39:22.550 --> 05:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
these matters for minor children within
 
05:39:24.170 --> 05:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
the existing framework in New Hampshire
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
as well as an increased scrutiny at the
 
05:39:28.250 --> 05:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
federal level of orders issued in cases
 
05:39:30.288 --> 05:39:30.298 align:start position:0%
for older Youth and for these reasons
 
05:39:32.330 --> 05:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
and to allow more clarity to come of
 
05:39:34.550 --> 05:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
these issues it seems most prudent to
 
05:39:36.470 --> 05:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
retain and revisit this legislation in
 
05:39:39.708 --> 05:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
the fall or again in a future year
 
05:39:42.530 --> 05:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
so why should we care about this issue
 
05:39:45.288 --> 05:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
there is some inconsistency among New
 
05:39:47.448 --> 05:39:47.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire judges in consideration of the
 
05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
cases filed on behalf of these
 
05:39:51.708 --> 05:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
vulnerable youth some judges issue
 
05:39:53.750 --> 05:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
findings While others don't see it in
 
05:39:55.368 --> 05:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
their Authority
 
05:39:57.890 --> 05:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
children particularly those in the group
 
05:40:00.350 --> 05:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
are the most vulnerable and are at risk
 
05:40:02.810 --> 05:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
for further abuse and Trauma and run the
 
05:40:05.570 --> 05:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
risk of homelessness prostitution forced
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
labor or trafficking and we fail them by
 
05:40:10.250 --> 05:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
not protecting them
 
05:40:11.990 --> 05:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the time that the committee
 
05:40:13.850 --> 05:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
has given to the support and issue today
 
05:40:16.610 --> 05:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
I believe you will hear from others who
 
05:40:18.170 --> 05:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
may have thoughts on retaining the bill
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
to look at the issue further in an
 
05:40:21.530 --> 05:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
attempt to provide guidance and to
 
05:40:23.448 --> 05:40:23.458 align:start position:0%
provide the structure needed to solve
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
this problem in our state
 
05:40:28.448 --> 05:40:28.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for you and the
 
05:40:33.430 --> 05:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
other members to get us copies of
 
05:40:36.288 --> 05:40:36.298 align:start position:0%
documents so that as you know things
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
wind down here in the spring we'll be
 
05:40:40.190 --> 05:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
able to open up our folders and start
 
05:40:43.310 --> 05:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
reading through what you have so when we
 
05:40:45.708 --> 05:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
have a day to just get everybody
 
05:40:47.868 --> 05:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
together and have some fun with it uh
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
we'll be pre-informed a little bit sure
 
05:40:52.190 --> 05:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
I think you'll hear from um different
 
05:40:54.170 --> 05:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
parties that uh may be interested in
 
05:40:55.910 --> 05:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
being part of that conversation any
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:06.530 --> 05:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
um representative DeSimone please pass
 
05:41:09.890 --> 05:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
two of your Altoids down to the
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:15.610 --> 05:41:15.620 align:start position:0%
representative bigford
 
05:41:15.620 --> 05:41:17.708 align:start position:0%
representative bigford
[Laughter]

05:41:17.708 --> 05:41:17.718 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:41:20.208 --> 05:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:41:20.218 --> 05:41:20.868 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:41:22.080 --> 05:41:23.690 align:start position:0%
thank you
I

05:41:23.690 --> 05:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
pretty washed on all this immigration
 
05:41:28.070 --> 05:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
stuff it's right outside my knowledge
 
05:41:31.910 --> 05:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
now 21 I see the age 21 in this case and
 
05:41:33.170 --> 05:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
generally of course New Hampshire we
 
05:41:35.628 --> 05:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
talk about 18 being agent majority could
 
05:41:38.810 --> 05:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
you explain that to me a little further
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
sure that was um part of the question
 
05:41:42.110 --> 05:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
um when I was going to file the bill and
 
05:41:46.010 --> 05:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
um that's some of the questions that
 
05:41:47.930 --> 05:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
we're trying to work out to see if if
 
05:41:49.250 --> 05:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
this is the right application for that
 
05:41:52.550 --> 05:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
so oh okay you can't really answer it no
 
05:41:54.830 --> 05:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
other than the federal law allows up to
 
05:41:57.650 --> 05:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
21. okay thank you thank you though
 
05:41:59.930 --> 05:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone
 
05:42:01.910 --> 05:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:42:04.430 --> 05:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question on the same line of
 
05:42:08.930 --> 05:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
the age of 21. it says here child means
 
05:42:11.150 --> 05:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
an unmarried person and I'm going to go
 
05:42:12.890 --> 05:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
back to a bill that we had a couple of
 
05:42:15.110 --> 05:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and in the state of New
 
05:42:18.350 --> 05:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh with judicial and parental
 
05:42:21.530 --> 05:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
consent you can be married at 16.
 
05:42:24.910 --> 05:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
not a good idea but you can be by law
 
05:42:28.550 --> 05:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
so do you really think that 21 should be
 
05:42:30.948 --> 05:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
the age of an unmarried
 
05:42:30.958 --> 05:42:33.948 align:start position:0%
the age of an unmarried
person

05:42:33.948 --> 05:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:36.050 --> 05:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just uh reporting on the fact that
 
05:42:37.610 --> 05:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
the federal law allows up to the age of
 
05:42:40.250 --> 05:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
21 for this immigration status
 
05:42:45.948 --> 05:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:48.770 --> 05:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you
 
05:42:52.550 --> 05:42:52.560 align:start position:0%

05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:00.230 --> 05:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay this is Portuguese right all right
 
05:43:04.128 --> 05:43:04.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:06.470 --> 05:43:06.480 align:start position:0%

05:43:29.750 --> 05:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:31.610 --> 05:43:31.620 align:start position:0%

05:43:34.490 --> 05:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
pushing the button and that activates
 
05:43:36.050 --> 05:43:36.060 align:start position:0%

05:43:49.548 --> 05:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
um so I have uh provided you with uh a
 
05:43:53.708 --> 05:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
sheet of paper of uh some uh important
 
05:43:55.910 --> 05:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
documentation pertaining to special
 
05:43:58.128 --> 05:43:58.138 align:start position:0%

um so you just open your camera uh I'm
 
05:44:05.628 --> 05:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
sorry because there was a lot of paper I
 
05:44:07.850 --> 05:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
didn't want to print out a lot of papers
 
05:44:10.910 --> 05:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
so uh if you open your phone
 
05:44:13.430 --> 05:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
um you can scan the code and you will
 
05:44:17.208 --> 05:44:17.218 align:start position:0%
pop up with the PDF so I'm trying to
 
05:44:19.670 --> 05:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
save you know some trees here but I also
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
sent it to your emails as well
 
05:44:26.570 --> 05:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
um so I I know I said I'm going to be
 
05:44:28.430 --> 05:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
five minutes but I'm gonna be a lot
 
05:44:31.250 --> 05:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
briefer than that so
 
05:44:33.948 --> 05:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
um so again my name is Bruno I am a
 
05:44:36.590 --> 05:44:36.600 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire Brazilian Council uh we
 
05:44:41.570 --> 05:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
are a non-profit organization who
 
05:44:44.448 --> 05:44:44.458 align:start position:0%

05:44:44.458 --> 05:44:45.788 align:start position:0%
assists uh immigrants and and other
individuals

05:44:45.788 --> 05:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:44:48.170 --> 05:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
mainly in the state of New Hampshire but
 
05:44:51.650 --> 05:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
in all the states as well I am also an
 
05:44:53.590 --> 05:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
immigration attorney
 
05:44:58.250 --> 05:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
I my license is active in Massachusetts
 
05:45:02.690 --> 05:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
um and in New Hampshire uh it's not I
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
have it as you know like not active so I
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
still pay my dues
 
05:45:10.850 --> 05:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
um but uh for for the purposes of a
 
05:45:13.430 --> 05:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
special immigrant juveniles
 
05:45:16.368 --> 05:45:16.378 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of cases mainly in
 
05:45:18.350 --> 05:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they're under the
 
05:45:20.510 --> 05:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
federal statute
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
um under their CFR
 
05:45:28.930 --> 05:45:28.940 align:start position:0%
um acfr it allows anyone who is under 21
 
05:45:31.490 --> 05:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
to apply for a special immigrant
 
05:45:31.500 --> 05:45:32.770 align:start position:0%
to apply for a special immigrant
juvenile

05:45:32.770 --> 05:45:32.780 align:start position:0%
juvenile
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
with uh USCIS
 
05:45:40.368 --> 05:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
um but in order to do that they need a
 
05:45:43.490 --> 05:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
practical order uh from the state courts
 
05:45:46.730 --> 05:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
I stating that it is not in the best
 
05:45:50.208 --> 05:45:50.218 align:start position:0%
interest to uh to return to to their
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
home country uh that they have been
 
05:45:58.010 --> 05:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
either abused abandoned or neglected by
 
05:46:03.048 --> 05:46:03.058 align:start position:0%
one or both their parents and typically
 
05:46:07.250 --> 05:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
um what happens is uh in the order we
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
ask the court to either
 
05:46:14.708 --> 05:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
um to be responsible for that child or
 
05:46:18.830 --> 05:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
99.9 of the time we asked the court to
 
05:46:22.850 --> 05:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
denominate another individual such as
 
05:46:24.548 --> 05:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
the other parent
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
and typically uh it's the mother who to
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
continue being responsible for for the
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
child and
 
05:46:35.990 --> 05:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
um in the New Hampshire unfortunately
 
05:46:40.010 --> 05:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
way we are having a lot of issues with
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh getting special findings
 
05:46:45.890 --> 05:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
um so the the courts they are in
 
05:46:50.330 --> 05:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
Conflict on how to issue these and uh
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
some of um the attorneys uh also do not
 
05:46:58.610 --> 05:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
know how to move forward so we are all
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
lost uh in New Hampshire on uh how to
 
05:47:05.690 --> 05:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
get special orders
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
um here and and this bill I think in
 
05:47:12.590 --> 05:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
like a representative terlurski is
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
05:47:17.628 --> 05:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
um you know take the first step to come
 
05:47:21.470 --> 05:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
together and hopefully solve the issue
 
05:47:24.430 --> 05:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
we currently have in the state
 
05:47:26.990 --> 05:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
so the documents that that I have
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
provided to you
 
05:47:32.628 --> 05:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
um the first one the USCIS definition is
 
05:47:35.570 --> 05:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
simply provides what the definition of a
 
05:47:39.490 --> 05:47:39.500 align:start position:0%
special juvenile if and
 
05:47:43.788 --> 05:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
if you also click on the the link it
 
05:47:46.430 --> 05:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
brings you to to the web page which is
 
05:47:48.110 --> 05:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
going to provide the same information as
 
05:47:51.230 --> 05:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
the PDF it's going to show you all the
 
05:47:53.990 --> 05:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
the requirements for
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the state court orders the
 
05:47:59.330 --> 05:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh one of the questions was
 
05:48:03.110 --> 05:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
whether the the person is unmarried at a
 
05:48:04.850 --> 05:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
state court level
 
05:48:07.788 --> 05:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
um the state can still issue the the or
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
the order uh but under uh federal law uh
 
05:48:15.890 --> 05:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
that would not be accepted but the state
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
can still issue these essentially would
 
05:48:21.288 --> 05:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
be a dependency order
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
um to to that child
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and he also uh the second QR code
 
05:48:31.910 --> 05:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
States the the purpose of why this law
 
05:48:31.920 --> 05:48:33.890 align:start position:0%
States the the purpose of why this law
was

05:48:33.890 --> 05:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:48:37.368 --> 05:48:37.378 align:start position:0%
um was created uh essentially there are
 
05:48:40.430 --> 05:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of abandoned abused and neglected
 
05:48:45.230 --> 05:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
children all over the world and and a
 
05:48:47.448 --> 05:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
lot of these children when you know they
 
05:48:49.610 --> 05:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
came to this country they didn't have a
 
05:48:52.490 --> 05:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
say on whether uh you know they wanted
 
05:48:54.110 --> 05:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
to leave their school in their home
 
05:48:56.868 --> 05:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
country you know their friends all they
 
05:48:58.330 --> 05:48:58.340 align:start position:0%
they knew
 
05:49:01.128 --> 05:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
behind the church or come you know to a
 
05:49:03.048 --> 05:49:03.058 align:start position:0%
new place
 
05:49:05.150 --> 05:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and you know like a whole completely
 
05:49:07.208 --> 05:49:07.218 align:start position:0%
uh different life
 
05:49:11.170 --> 05:49:11.180 align:start position:0%
and the third one uh is the the CFR
 
05:49:15.010 --> 05:49:15.020 align:start position:0%
which provides the uh the actual
 
05:49:18.770 --> 05:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
language of the the federal code on what
 
05:49:20.110 --> 05:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
and uh the the fourth QR code uh at the
 
05:49:24.718 --> 05:49:26.030 align:start position:0%
and uh the the fourth QR code uh at the
bottom

05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%

typically file
 
05:49:54.890 --> 05:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:57.650 --> 05:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:49:59.270 --> 05:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:50:02.030 --> 05:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative disamoni thank you Mr
 
05:50:03.830 --> 05:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:50:03.840 --> 05:50:05.390 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

05:50:05.390 --> 05:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:50:08.510 --> 05:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
um how many uh special immigrant
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
juveniles do we have in New Hampshire to
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
your knowledge
 
05:50:16.430 --> 05:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
that is a very good question
 
05:50:21.288 --> 05:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
um so uh it is hard to to say uh because
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of immigrants they they live in
 
05:50:27.288 --> 05:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
fear so they live in the shadows and
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
it's a very difficult to give you a
 
05:50:31.368 --> 05:50:31.378 align:start position:0%
number but I'm gonna give you uh you
 
05:50:33.530 --> 05:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
know like a number from
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:50:35.520 --> 05:50:36.730 align:start position:0%
um the
um

05:50:36.730 --> 05:50:36.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:40.250 --> 05:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
ah the I forgot so it's part of uh one
 
05:50:42.708 --> 05:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
of the programs from from the chamber uh
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
in New York uh it's a new American uh
 
05:50:48.350 --> 05:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I forgot the name of the report I'm
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
so sorry
 
05:50:52.910 --> 05:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
um so we estimated that we have uh
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 000 undocumented
 
05:50:57.530 --> 05:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
immigrants in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:51:01.690 --> 05:51:01.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:06.490 --> 05:51:06.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up it is that juveniles or all
 
05:51:09.948 --> 05:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
undocumented so all undocumented
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman would
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
it be appropriate for uh me to
 
05:51:21.230 --> 05:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge attorney de Brito as a
 
05:51:23.570 --> 05:51:23.580 align:start position:0%

was happy to have to be able to walk
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
over here today
 
05:52:50.990 --> 05:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
um as representative talerski explained
 
05:52:53.150 --> 05:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
in her opening remarks special immigrant
 
05:52:55.430 --> 05:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
juvenile status or Siege is all
 
05:52:57.430 --> 05:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
inevitably call it as I talk today
 
05:53:00.170 --> 05:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
provides a path to permanent residency
 
05:53:02.270 --> 05:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
for non-citizen youth who have been
 
05:53:04.368 --> 05:53:04.378 align:start position:0%
abused neglected or abandoned by one or
 
05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
both of their parents that path begins
 
05:53:09.770 --> 05:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
with a determination made by a juvenile
 
05:53:12.170 --> 05:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
or similar court that the child is under
 
05:53:15.048 --> 05:53:15.058 align:start position:0%
21 that the child is unmarried and that
 
05:53:17.208 --> 05:53:17.218 align:start position:0%
the child is dependent upon the court
 
05:53:19.128 --> 05:53:19.138 align:start position:0%
that the child has been abused neglected
 
05:53:22.430 --> 05:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
or abandoned by one or both or other
 
05:53:24.350 --> 05:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
um by one or both of their parents or
 
05:53:27.048 --> 05:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
another another caretaker and that it is
 
05:53:28.610 --> 05:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the child to
 
05:53:31.150 --> 05:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
remain in the United States
 
05:53:31.160 --> 05:53:32.948 align:start position:0%
remain in the United States
as

05:53:32.948 --> 05:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:53:36.048 --> 05:53:36.058 align:start position:0%
the federal government has delegated the
 
05:53:38.270 --> 05:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
this these responsibilities for the
 
05:53:40.250 --> 05:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
findings to the state court because it
 
05:53:41.930 --> 05:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
is within their purview to make best
 
05:53:43.548 --> 05:53:43.558 align:start position:0%
interest findings
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
um for youth residents of their states
 
05:53:49.010 --> 05:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:53:51.230 --> 05:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
because these findings are based upon
 
05:53:53.150 --> 05:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
state law the mechanisms vary from state
 
05:53:54.590 --> 05:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
to state
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
the bill presented today has identifies
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
an issue that presents a discrepancy
 
05:54:01.070 --> 05:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
between New Hampshire state law and the
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
federal requirements under New Hampshire
 
05:54:05.390 --> 05:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
law a child may only be depend dependent
 
05:54:07.788 --> 05:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
upon the court if he or she is under 18
 
05:54:11.090 --> 05:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
or over 18 and incapacitated
 
05:54:12.708 --> 05:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
Federal immigration law defines the
 
05:54:15.288 --> 05:54:15.298 align:start position:0%
child as anyone under 21. this bill
 
05:54:17.270 --> 05:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
intends in part to bridge that Gap and
 
05:54:18.590 --> 05:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
to bring New Hampshire into compliance
 
05:54:21.170 --> 05:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
with its obligations under federal law
 
05:54:22.930 --> 05:54:22.940 align:start position:0%
there are many other procedural
 
05:54:25.250 --> 05:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
difficulties with SIDS that are winding
 
05:54:26.150 --> 05:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
their way through the New Hampshire
 
05:54:28.070 --> 05:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
courts right now
 
05:54:29.628 --> 05:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
um lawyers in the state have been
 
05:54:31.250 --> 05:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
seeking these special findings through
 
05:54:34.128 --> 05:54:34.138 align:start position:0%
three primary mechanisms for the past
 
05:54:36.770 --> 05:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
probably 20 years now
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
um guarded through guardianship
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
petitions through 169 C abuse neglect
 
05:54:42.288 --> 05:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
petitions and through parenting
 
05:54:42.298 --> 05:54:43.670 align:start position:0%
petitions and through parenting
petitions

05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
petitions
 
05:54:45.288 --> 05:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
and in recent months the New Hampshire
 
05:54:46.910 --> 05:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
circuit court has stated a firm
 
05:54:48.948 --> 05:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
preference for the use of the
 
05:54:50.510 --> 05:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
guardianship petition because it does
 
05:54:53.208 --> 05:54:53.218 align:start position:0%
not require dcyf involvement like the
 
05:54:55.910 --> 05:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
169c petition does
 
05:54:58.010 --> 05:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
um some judges however are not aligned
 
05:54:59.810 --> 05:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
with the court and finding that they
 
05:55:01.610 --> 05:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
either have no authority to issue such
 
05:55:04.128 --> 05:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
findings in a guardianship hearing or
 
05:55:06.830 --> 05:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
just simply declined to do so
 
05:55:08.990 --> 05:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
um further guardianship is not the
 
05:55:11.390 --> 05:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate vehicle for every case as
 
05:55:12.948 --> 05:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
some children's need for dependency on
 
05:55:14.810 --> 05:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
the court varies in form
 
05:55:17.448 --> 05:55:17.458 align:start position:0%
these jurisdictional issues along with
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
some service difficulties are the main
 
05:55:21.590 --> 05:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
obstacles to efficient administration of
 
05:55:23.448 --> 05:55:23.458 align:start position:0%
these cases in the New Hampshire family
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
courts right now and this bill does not
 
05:55:28.250 --> 05:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
address each of those difficulties that
 
05:55:31.310 --> 05:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
we have that we find ourselves facing
 
05:55:33.890 --> 05:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
um as attorneys who represent these
 
05:55:33.900 --> 05:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
um as attorneys who represent these
clients

05:55:35.510 --> 05:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
clients
 
05:55:37.368 --> 05:55:37.378 align:start position:0%
um I agree that there needs to be
 
05:55:39.128 --> 05:55:39.138 align:start position:0%
guidance in the statute on the proper
 
05:55:40.910 --> 05:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
procedure for seeking these special
 
05:55:43.730 --> 05:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
findings the this bill attempts to do
 
05:55:45.590 --> 05:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
that but ultimately presents additional
 
05:55:45.600 --> 05:55:46.970 align:start position:0%
that but ultimately presents additional
issues

05:55:46.970 --> 05:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion as it is of
 
05:55:53.810 --> 05:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
Representative talerski's um it is
 
05:55:55.490 --> 05:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
in the best interest to retain this bill
 
05:55:59.948 --> 05:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
for work in the fall or at a later time
 
05:56:02.448 --> 05:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
as we try to work out through the court
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
system some of the procedural issues
 
05:56:08.448 --> 05:56:08.458 align:start position:0%
that are that we're facing with the
 
05:56:08.458 --> 05:56:09.830 align:start position:0%
that are that we're facing with the
courts

05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
courts
 
05:56:12.230 --> 05:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
um additionally approximately two two
 
05:56:14.030 --> 05:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and after the introduction of
 
05:56:16.548 --> 05:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
the bill the USCIS which is the United
 
05:56:19.850 --> 05:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
States immigration citizenship Services
 
05:56:21.350 --> 05:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
um citizenship and Immigration Services
 
05:56:23.448 --> 05:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
sorry said that backwards
 
05:56:25.128 --> 05:56:25.138 align:start position:0%
um has made clear that bills like this
 
05:56:27.110 --> 05:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
one which seek to impose a new cause of
 
05:56:28.788 --> 05:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
action solely for the purpose of
 
05:56:31.430 --> 05:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
obtaining special findings will trigger
 
05:56:32.990 --> 05:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
additional scrutiny
 
05:56:34.788 --> 05:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
um by them when they are reviewing these
 
05:56:36.770 --> 05:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
immigration petitions after the family
 
05:56:39.230 --> 05:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
court process and they may not
 
05:56:40.910 --> 05:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately provide the protection that
 
05:56:42.288 --> 05:56:42.298 align:start position:0%
everyone seeks to achieve for these
 
05:56:44.208 --> 05:56:44.218 align:start position:0%
vulnerable youth
 
05:56:46.190 --> 05:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
um that is the last thing we want when
 
05:56:48.830 --> 05:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's not the purpose of amending the law
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
I think representative tolerski for
 
05:56:52.368 --> 05:56:52.378 align:start position:0%
putting her voice behind this fight and
 
05:56:54.410 --> 05:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
for seeking to help abused abandoned or
 
05:56:56.090 --> 05:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
neglected non-citizen youth seeking
 
05:56:58.070 --> 05:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
refuge in New Hampshire
 
05:57:00.530 --> 05:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
um I again support these efforts and
 
05:57:03.830 --> 05:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
hope that we can work them out over
 
05:57:07.010 --> 05:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
um over the time and into the fall
 
05:57:07.020 --> 05:57:08.090 align:start position:0%
um over the time and into the fall
um

05:57:08.090 --> 05:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:10.368 --> 05:57:10.378 align:start position:0%
we certainly look forward to working
 
05:57:11.628 --> 05:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
with the committee to resolve this
 
05:57:14.270 --> 05:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
discrepancy in the law and working out
 
05:57:15.830 --> 05:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
the procedural issues we're facing right
 
05:57:18.890 --> 05:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
now in the family courts thank you

um between the time it was drafted which

period yeah the bill was drafted during
 
06:02:23.510 --> 06:02:23.520 align:start position:0%

to finish up in late December
 
06:02:28.610 --> 06:02:28.620 align:start position:0%

conflict with what was in statute under

06:02:42.948 --> 06:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:02:42.958 --> 06:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
with
um

06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:47.990 --> 06:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
having Rules of Evidence for cases
 
06:02:50.510 --> 06:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
within the dcyf right in the child
 
06:02:54.830 --> 06:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
neglect and abuse statutes so
 
06:02:57.288 --> 06:02:57.298 align:start position:0%
um under current law
 
06:03:00.548 --> 06:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
under 169 C12
 
06:03:04.128 --> 06:03:04.138 align:start position:0%
there is a carve out and I think I can
 
06:03:06.410 --> 06:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
read it for you real quick
 
06:03:06.420 --> 06:03:07.850 align:start position:0%
read it for you real quick
um

06:03:07.850 --> 06:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:09.890 --> 06:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
that the rules of evidence do not apply
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
that's where it goes today
 
06:03:15.770 --> 06:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and part of that is
 
06:03:17.990 --> 06:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
um maybe there might be a good reason to
 
06:03:19.970 --> 06:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
not apply Rules of Evidence it's hard to
 
06:03:22.030 --> 06:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do with a young child
 
06:03:26.208 --> 06:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
who has relative information now in an
 
06:03:29.868 --> 06:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
abuse case and dcyf needs to testify on
 
06:03:29.878 --> 06:03:32.990 align:start position:0%
abuse case and dcyf needs to testify on
that

06:03:32.990 --> 06:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:33.000 --> 06:03:34.730 align:start position:0%
 
however

06:03:34.730 --> 06:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:03:34.740 --> 06:03:35.390 align:start position:0%
however
um

06:03:35.390 --> 06:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
there should be some standard by which
 
06:03:41.090 --> 06:03:41.100 align:start position:0%
evidence is presented in these cases and
 
06:03:44.930 --> 06:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to deal with 169
 
06:03:44.940 --> 06:03:46.430 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to deal with 169
C12

06:03:46.430 --> 06:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
C12
 
06:03:49.430 --> 06:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay which I quote in here in any
 
06:03:50.990 --> 06:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
hearing under this chapter the court
 
06:03:52.490 --> 06:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
shall not be bound by the technical
 
06:03:54.350 --> 06:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence and may admit evidence
 
06:03:56.208 --> 06:03:56.218 align:start position:0%
which it considers relevant in material
 
06:03:58.490 --> 06:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
evidence of Prior founded or unfounded
 
06:04:00.170 --> 06:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
reports of abuse or neglect shall be
 
06:04:01.970 --> 06:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
admissible in the proceedings under this
 
06:04:04.310 --> 06:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
chapter in order to establish a relevant
 
06:04:06.770 --> 06:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
pattern or course of conduct that is the
 
06:04:08.288 --> 06:04:08.298 align:start position:0%
current law today
 
06:04:10.368 --> 06:04:10.378 align:start position:0%
the amendment in front of you actually
 
06:04:13.010 --> 06:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
replaces all of that
 
06:04:14.690 --> 06:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
we should have some standard by which
 
06:04:18.530 --> 06:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.910 --> 06:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
what we have seen is cases where people
 
06:04:24.948 --> 06:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
are denied the chance to have
 
06:04:27.948 --> 06:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
information that is beneficial to them
 
06:04:29.868 --> 06:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
because the judge has complete
 
06:04:29.878 --> 06:04:32.510 align:start position:0%
because the judge has complete
discretion

06:04:32.510 --> 06:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:38.690 --> 06:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
that sets up a non-due process type
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
process I guess right there is no due
 
06:04:44.030 --> 06:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
process if all the evidence is slanted
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
in favor of the state pursuing a
 
06:04:46.558 --> 06:04:48.650 align:start position:0%
in favor of the state pursuing a
respondent

06:04:48.650 --> 06:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
respondent
 
06:04:50.690 --> 06:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
the next section of this which is two
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
and this was asked for what if there
 
06:04:54.470 --> 06:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be a waiver
 
06:04:58.310 --> 06:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and I drafted in lines 14 and 15 if
 
06:04:59.570 --> 06:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
the judge has reason to believe that
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
applying the Rules of Evidence would
 
06:05:03.410 --> 06:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
challenge adversely affect the case the
 
06:05:04.970 --> 06:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
judge May waive the rules of evidence
 
06:05:06.830 --> 06:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
and shall note in the file the rationale
 
06:05:08.208 --> 06:05:08.218 align:start position:0%
for this decision
 
06:05:10.430 --> 06:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
I believe when you do shells and statues
 
06:05:12.890 --> 06:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement always right it's
 
06:05:14.628 --> 06:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
either May or shall
 
06:05:16.610 --> 06:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
shall is right the Rules of Evidence
 
06:05:18.288 --> 06:05:18.298 align:start position:0%
shall be applied but if there's a reason
 
06:05:21.410 --> 06:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
that the judge has
 
06:05:23.510 --> 06:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and this can be in consultation with
 
06:05:25.128 --> 06:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
either the attorneys
 
06:05:26.750 --> 06:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
um has reason to believe that the Rules
 
06:05:28.970 --> 06:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
of Evidence would be adversity adverse
 
06:05:31.070 --> 06:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
to the hearing allowing the judge to
 
06:05:32.990 --> 06:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
waive those rules would be
 
06:05:35.208 --> 06:05:35.218 align:start position:0%
um prudent and then he just needs to
 
06:05:38.390 --> 06:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
note he or she needs to know why in the
 
06:05:41.750 --> 06:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
case they did that for instance it's a
 
06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
pro se respondent and the pro se
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
respondent doesn't necessarily know All
 
06:05:47.570 --> 06:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence so the pro se
 
06:05:49.850 --> 06:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
respondent could in fact trip himself or
 
06:05:52.368 --> 06:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
herself up on trying to respond to an
 
06:05:55.128 --> 06:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
accusation because they aren't familiar
 
06:05:57.708 --> 06:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
with court rules
 
06:06:00.350 --> 06:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
um there might be a case where the state
 
06:06:03.230 --> 06:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
as the plaintiff has compelling evidence
 
06:06:05.150 --> 06:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
that would be difficult to admit because
 
06:06:07.128 --> 06:06:07.138 align:start position:0%
it's a young it's a child in this case
 
06:06:08.930 --> 06:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
and and the child can't testify
 
06:06:10.490 --> 06:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
themselves we don't want the child to
 
06:06:13.070 --> 06:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
testify so now it's second-hand
 
06:06:15.288 --> 06:06:15.298 align:start position:0%
information but it needs to be presented
 
06:06:17.810 --> 06:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
because it's relevant to the case so the
 
06:06:20.090 --> 06:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
judge has that level of discretion in
 
06:06:22.070 --> 06:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
section two
 
06:06:22.080 --> 06:06:23.330 align:start position:0%
section two
uh

06:06:23.330 --> 06:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:06:25.548 --> 06:06:25.558 align:start position:0%
excuse me for one second are there extra
 
06:06:28.310 --> 06:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
copies of the amendment around could you
 
06:06:32.830 --> 06:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
give one to attorney Ed I think since
 
06:06:36.890 --> 06:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
oh um should be 30 copies or so it could
 
06:06:38.350 --> 06:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
be yeah
 
06:06:42.288 --> 06:06:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:42.298 --> 06:06:45.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:06:45.708 --> 06:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:47.690 --> 06:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
because I think this amendment really is
 
06:06:50.930 --> 06:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
a good faith effort on the sponsor to
 
06:06:53.030 --> 06:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
um take into account a variety of things
 
06:06:56.868 --> 06:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
right the original bill when drafted put
 
06:06:58.910 --> 06:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
it into court rules but it was so broad
 
06:07:01.510 --> 06:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
it would have covered all family court
 
06:07:05.030 --> 06:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings and it was never intended I
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
I would suggest you suspend for just a
 
06:07:11.208 --> 06:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:13.368 --> 06:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
okay back up about three sentences and
 
06:07:15.890 --> 06:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:18.830 --> 06:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
sure the bill has filed
 
06:07:21.230 --> 06:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
06:07:25.070 --> 06:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
um OLS drafted into section 490--d which
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
has to do with oversight of Courts
 
06:07:31.910 --> 06:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
the issue is it covers all
 
06:07:34.010 --> 06:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
um Family Court proceedings and there
 
06:07:35.270 --> 06:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
are other things that go on in family
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
courts other than child neglect and
 
06:07:40.070 --> 06:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
abuse cases right this would have
 
06:07:44.150 --> 06:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
impacted all cases relative to divorce
 
06:07:45.650 --> 06:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
proceedings for instance some other
 
06:07:45.660 --> 06:07:46.730 align:start position:0%
proceedings for instance some other
things

06:07:46.730 --> 06:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:07:49.610 --> 06:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
this is really about a narrow section of
 
06:07:51.590 --> 06:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
that which is why the language actually
 
06:07:54.548 --> 06:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
should have been put in 169-c to address
 
06:07:59.570 --> 06:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
the cases what under 169 C
 
06:07:59.580 --> 06:08:00.830 align:start position:0%
the cases what under 169 C
um

06:08:00.830 --> 06:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:06.170 --> 06:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:08.090 --> 06:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
um level of drafting issue that was
 
06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
corrected in the amendment as well
 
06:08:13.788 --> 06:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
so I would ask that you would consider
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
and debate on the amended version of
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
zero six one nine H as opposed to the
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill as filed
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
and it would be easy as the committee to
 
06:08:25.850 --> 06:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
to default back to the bill but you've
 
06:08:27.890 --> 06:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
all been provided and copies of this
 
06:08:29.930 --> 06:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
we've provided copies to those in
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
attendance so that it can be discussed
 
06:08:36.288 --> 06:08:36.298 align:start position:0%
um on this and it's simply establishing
 
06:08:38.208 --> 06:08:38.218 align:start position:0%
a baseline so everybody knows the rules
 
06:08:39.410 --> 06:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
of the game going into a court
 
06:08:39.420 --> 06:08:40.788 align:start position:0%
of the game going into a court
proceeding

06:08:40.788 --> 06:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
06:08:42.590 --> 06:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
with that I'll close my testimony
 
06:08:49.690 --> 06:08:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:51.890 --> 06:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
06:08:54.110 --> 06:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
chairman you should just assume I have a
 
06:08:55.788 --> 06:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
question I would suggest you alternate
 
06:08:57.470 --> 06:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
arms otherwise you will wind up being
 
06:08:59.810 --> 06:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
lopsided thank you it's possible it's
 
06:09:01.850 --> 06:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
possible thank you representative Hull
 
06:09:04.430 --> 06:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
um once again for coming before us
 
06:09:04.440 --> 06:09:05.090 align:start position:0%
um once again for coming before us
um

06:09:05.090 --> 06:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:08.030 --> 06:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
and for catching that legal reference
 
06:09:09.470 --> 06:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
right away because that was one of my
 
06:09:11.628 --> 06:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
big circled questions from before and
 
06:09:13.368 --> 06:09:13.378 align:start position:0%
that changes
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
um my reading of this significantly
 
06:09:18.890 --> 06:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
um so now I'm back to
 
06:09:20.930 --> 06:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
um a question I'm gonna ask you about
 
06:09:20.940 --> 06:09:22.310 align:start position:0%
um a question I'm gonna ask you about
the

06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:09:24.230 --> 06:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
um Amendment which is basically the same
 
06:09:24.240 --> 06:09:25.070 align:start position:0%
um Amendment which is basically the same
thing

06:09:25.070 --> 06:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:09:28.270 --> 06:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
um my question is it seems to me that
 
06:09:31.368 --> 06:09:31.378 align:start position:0%
your Roman numeral one and Roman numeral
 
06:09:31.378 --> 06:09:32.990 align:start position:0%
your Roman numeral one and Roman numeral
two

06:09:32.990 --> 06:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:09:35.270 --> 06:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
are kind of In conflict with each other
 
06:09:36.830 --> 06:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if you can speak a
 
06:09:38.330 --> 06:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
little bit more about it because Roman
 
06:09:41.510 --> 06:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
numeral one says that this the court
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
shall admit any evidence or testimony
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
offered by the respondent
 
06:09:49.128 --> 06:09:49.138 align:start position:0%
but then number two says the court shall
 
06:09:50.690 --> 06:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
apply the New Hampshire Rules of
 
06:09:50.700 --> 06:09:51.890 align:start position:0%
apply the New Hampshire Rules of
Evidence

06:09:51.890 --> 06:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
Evidence
 
06:09:53.750 --> 06:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
unless they waive it and give a reason
 
06:09:56.510 --> 06:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
why so if they're does that mean that
 
06:09:58.730 --> 06:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
the respondent
 
06:10:00.048 --> 06:10:00.058 align:start position:0%
um can have whatever they wanted
 
06:10:03.470 --> 06:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
admitted but then dcyf or a therapist or
 
06:10:04.970 --> 06:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
whomever are held to a different
 
06:10:07.430 --> 06:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
standard than the parent or are you
 
06:10:09.170 --> 06:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
06:10:11.510 --> 06:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they will admit it but they have to
 
06:10:13.430 --> 06:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
have a footnote saying why they admitted
 
06:10:15.230 --> 06:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
it so I'm like I'm confused about how
 
06:10:17.390 --> 06:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
the two parts work together merge
 
06:10:19.548 --> 06:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
together great question thank you so
 
06:10:22.190 --> 06:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
that is a question I think I understood
 
06:10:24.410 --> 06:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
it and to answer your question how do
 
06:10:26.510 --> 06:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
sections Roman numeral one and Roman
 
06:10:29.150 --> 06:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two merge together and I
 
06:10:30.830 --> 06:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
think we need to establish what is the
 
06:10:32.510 --> 06:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence I would expect that if
 
06:10:35.208 --> 06:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
dcyf is at a hearing
 
06:10:36.770 --> 06:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
their attorneys are going to understand
 
06:10:39.170 --> 06:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence they will be able
 
06:10:40.910 --> 06:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
to follow the rules they can go to the
 
06:10:42.530 --> 06:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
judge and say I need to waive the Rules
 
06:10:44.990 --> 06:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
of Evidence because of X right I have
 
06:10:47.150 --> 06:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
compelling reason to waive the rules and
 
06:10:49.190 --> 06:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
they can make that motion to the judge
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
that's going to be easy for an attorney
 
06:10:53.270 --> 06:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
um likewise the respondent or their
 
06:10:56.868 --> 06:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
attorney could could do the same thing
 
06:10:58.970 --> 06:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
this establishes the floor we all are
 
06:11:00.470 --> 06:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to use the Rules of Evidence so we
 
06:11:02.270 --> 06:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
have some process we have some
 
06:11:03.890 --> 06:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
collective set of Standards by which
 
06:11:06.230 --> 06:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
evidence is being applied both parties
 
06:11:08.810 --> 06:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
can ask for a wave of the rules
 
06:11:10.548 --> 06:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
the only thing that is required when
 
06:11:12.288 --> 06:11:12.298 align:start position:0%
that happens is the judge has to know
 
06:11:15.230 --> 06:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
why he or she is doing that and I think
 
06:11:17.270 --> 06:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's the footnote in the case that
 
06:11:20.090 --> 06:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
says look I believe that dcy have had
 
06:11:22.970 --> 06:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
compelling evidence and I I okay but it
 
06:11:24.590 --> 06:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
didn't comply with the rules the
 
06:11:26.628 --> 06:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
standard Rules of Evidence so I admitted
 
06:11:28.070 --> 06:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
it because it was relevant to the
 
06:11:29.628 --> 06:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
hearing and would have adversely
 
06:11:31.788 --> 06:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
affected the outcome and it doesn't
 
06:11:34.610 --> 06:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's neutral language it's not right
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
in favor of the plaintiff or or the
 
06:11:39.288 --> 06:11:39.298 align:start position:0%
respondent it's purely neutral Outland
 
06:11:41.690 --> 06:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
because the judge may come may see
 
06:11:43.490 --> 06:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
something in that evidence that is
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
valuable to making a decision so does
 
06:11:47.270 --> 06:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
that help you understand how they merge
 
06:11:47.280 --> 06:11:48.948 align:start position:0%
that help you understand how they merge
together

06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
together
 
06:11:51.288 --> 06:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
no it didn't I got halfway there so I
 
06:11:53.810 --> 06:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
understand I because I think you spoke
 
06:11:56.930 --> 06:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
to number two number two is the Rules of
 
06:11:59.628 --> 06:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
Evidence shall apply unless there's some
 
06:12:01.310 --> 06:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
compelling reason why they shouldn't and
 
06:12:04.070 --> 06:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm hearing you say either the
 
06:12:06.830 --> 06:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
respondent or dcyf can say here's why it
 
06:12:08.930 --> 06:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply and the judge can make a
 
06:12:11.448 --> 06:12:11.458 align:start position:0%
ruling but then number one says except
 
06:12:13.250 --> 06:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
that doesn't apply to the respondent the
 
06:12:14.510 --> 06:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
respondent can have whatever they want
 
06:12:14.520 --> 06:12:15.830 align:start position:0%
respondent can have whatever they want
admitted

06:12:15.830 --> 06:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
admitted
 
06:12:20.448 --> 06:12:20.458 align:start position:0%
so right yes okay so we're in sync and I
 
06:12:22.730 --> 06:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
will explain why one is left for the
 
06:12:22.740 --> 06:12:23.930 align:start position:0%
will explain why one is left for the
respondent

06:12:23.930 --> 06:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
respondent
 
06:12:27.230 --> 06:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
so this is a constitutional issue I
 
06:12:29.570 --> 06:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
don't have my I do hold on the New
 
06:12:31.788 --> 06:12:31.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution right under part
 
06:12:36.048 --> 06:12:36.058 align:start position:0%
first article 20 I think
 
06:12:39.470 --> 06:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
um is is very similar language about all
 
06:12:42.288 --> 06:12:42.298 align:start position:0%
proofs favorable to them right and that
 
06:12:45.170 --> 06:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
has to do with criminal cases but in
 
06:12:48.590 --> 06:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
this case it would apply as well
 
06:12:48.600 --> 06:12:49.490 align:start position:0%
this case it would apply as well
um

06:12:49.490 --> 06:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:51.470 --> 06:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
did you say you think it's article 20. I
 
06:12:53.030 --> 06:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
want to say it's article 20. let me just
 
06:12:55.368 --> 06:12:55.378 align:start position:0%
check real quick I'm happy to Google
 
06:12:55.378 --> 06:12:56.270 align:start position:0%
check real quick I'm happy to Google
that

06:12:56.270 --> 06:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:12:56.280 --> 06:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

06:12:57.110 --> 06:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:12:57.120 --> 06:12:58.368 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

06:12:58.368 --> 06:12:58.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:03.230 --> 06:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:03.240 --> 06:13:04.548 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:07.430 --> 06:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
rights of the Q is 15 right no
 
06:13:09.110 --> 06:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
um every subject shall have a right to
 
06:13:11.270 --> 06:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
produce all proofs that may be favorable
 
06:13:13.490 --> 06:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
to himself sorry it's written in single
 
06:13:15.350 --> 06:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
gender at that point to meet with the
 
06:13:16.970 --> 06:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
witnesses against them face to face and
 
06:13:19.128 --> 06:13:19.138 align:start position:0%
to be fully heard in his defense by
 
06:13:21.350 --> 06:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
himself and counsel and
 
06:13:23.930 --> 06:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's regarding Criminal
 
06:13:27.470 --> 06:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
criminal it doesn't and both in in all
 
06:13:27.480 --> 06:13:28.788 align:start position:0%
criminal it doesn't and both in in all
of

06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:13:30.470 --> 06:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
um part first right of the
 
06:13:31.788 --> 06:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Bill of Rights it does
 
06:13:33.350 --> 06:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
address civil cases it talks about
 
06:13:34.850 --> 06:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
Property Transfers it talks about
 
06:13:36.350 --> 06:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
charges over fifteen hundred dollars
 
06:13:37.970 --> 06:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
right requiring
 
06:13:42.770 --> 06:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
um a jury trial so I would argue that in
 
06:13:45.048 --> 06:13:45.058 align:start position:0%
this case right
 
06:13:47.330 --> 06:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about child neglect
 
06:13:48.970 --> 06:13:48.980 align:start position:0%
and abuse
 
06:13:51.470 --> 06:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
accusations and we're talking about
 
06:13:53.390 --> 06:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
potentially the removal of home which is
 
06:13:55.368 --> 06:13:55.378 align:start position:0%
a punishment on par with a felony level
 
06:13:57.410 --> 06:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
offense at least in my eyes that's right
 
06:13:59.150 --> 06:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
it's certainly traumatic right it's
 
06:14:00.530 --> 06:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
traumatic for all parties involved
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
including the child if we're if if the
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
state is getting that involved into the
 
06:14:06.530 --> 06:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
case or right in that involved in the
 
06:14:09.830 --> 06:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
family through this case there is Merit
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
to the respondent having
 
06:14:14.208 --> 06:14:14.218 align:start position:0%
access to all proofs that are favorable
 
06:14:16.250 --> 06:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
to him or her per the Constitution part
 
06:14:18.288 --> 06:14:18.298 align:start position:0%
first Article 15 which is why it's
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
drafted I did not quote verbatim but it
 
06:14:22.430 --> 06:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
is drafted to be very similar to that
 
06:14:24.770 --> 06:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
style language
 
06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
um and then remember the state has
 
06:14:29.390 --> 06:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
effectively unlimited resources in a
 
06:14:32.208 --> 06:14:32.218 align:start position:0%
dcyf case the respondent does not the
 
06:14:33.530 --> 06:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
respondent has what their checkbook
 
06:14:35.208 --> 06:14:35.218 align:start position:0%
allows or what they can borrow or what
 
06:14:37.310 --> 06:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
their friends will give them that is a
 
06:14:39.708 --> 06:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
very lopsided case when it comes to a
 
06:14:41.810 --> 06:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
court hearing it's not two parties
 
06:14:41.820 --> 06:14:43.208 align:start position:0%
court hearing it's not two parties
laying

06:14:43.208 --> 06:14:43.218 align:start position:0%
laying
 
06:14:47.270 --> 06:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
debating on even Financial playing field
 
06:14:50.448 --> 06:14:50.458 align:start position:0%
almost always the responded is does not
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
have access to the same resources that
 
06:14:57.170 --> 06:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:57.180 --> 06:14:59.690 align:start position:0%
 
sure

06:14:59.690 --> 06:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:01.128 --> 06:15:01.138 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
06:15:01.138 --> 06:15:06.650 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

06:15:06.650 --> 06:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:09.048 --> 06:15:09.058 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you the
 
06:15:22.730 --> 06:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:24.170 --> 06:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
06:15:25.610 --> 06:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Richard head
 
06:15:27.170 --> 06:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs coordinator
 
06:15:29.810 --> 06:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
 
06:15:29.820 --> 06:15:30.410 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
um

06:15:30.410 --> 06:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:32.270 --> 06:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the sponsors
 
06:15:34.430 --> 06:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
clarification in the amendment and I'm
 
06:15:36.110 --> 06:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
just going to speak to the amendment as
 
06:15:38.510 --> 06:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to the original bill on the
 
06:15:40.610 --> 06:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
assumption that is going forward in that
 
06:15:40.620 --> 06:15:41.390 align:start position:0%
assumption that is going forward in that
way

06:15:41.390 --> 06:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:15:43.128 --> 06:15:43.138 align:start position:0%
um the amendment does help clarify in
 
06:15:44.990 --> 06:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
terms of limiting it to the section and
 
06:15:48.830 --> 06:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
or limiting it to 169 C
 
06:15:48.840 --> 06:15:50.270 align:start position:0%
or limiting it to 169 C
um

06:15:50.270 --> 06:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:53.030 --> 06:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
I do believe notwithstanding the
 
06:15:55.310 --> 06:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative's explanation as to why
 
06:15:57.048 --> 06:15:57.058 align:start position:0%
paragraphs one and two are not
 
06:16:00.048 --> 06:16:00.058 align:start position:0%
inconsistent um they are inconsistent
 
06:16:02.990 --> 06:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
and in paragraph one goes substantially
 
06:16:03.000 --> 06:16:04.250 align:start position:0%
and in paragraph one goes substantially
Beyond

06:16:04.250 --> 06:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
Beyond
 
06:16:07.070 --> 06:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
what the Constitution provides in part
 
06:16:09.010 --> 06:16:09.020 align:start position:0%
one Article 15
 
06:16:12.470 --> 06:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
the the amendment in in paragraph Roman
 
06:16:15.170 --> 06:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
one would read that on the court shall
 
06:16:18.350 --> 06:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
admit any evidence or testimony in any
 
06:16:22.850 --> 06:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
form offered by the respondent oops
 
06:16:22.860 --> 06:16:24.830 align:start position:0%
form offered by the respondent oops
um

06:16:24.830 --> 06:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:26.810 --> 06:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
in a Family Division case which the
 
06:16:28.310 --> 06:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
respondent believes will be favorable to
 
06:16:30.288 --> 06:16:30.298 align:start position:0%
his or her case
 
06:16:32.448 --> 06:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
each one it still talks about Family
 
06:16:36.170 --> 06:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
Division case but it's in 169 C so I
 
06:16:37.548 --> 06:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
would have to assume that's limited to
 
06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
169 C I think that needs to still be
 
06:16:43.610 --> 06:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
clarified but the expansion is that
 
06:16:45.650 --> 06:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
there shall admit any evidence or
 
06:16:50.330 --> 06:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
testimony in any form so it is it
 
06:16:53.510 --> 06:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's no res there's no capacity for
 
06:16:56.208 --> 06:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
the judge to apply the rules of evidence
 
06:17:00.890 --> 06:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
for example as to relevance and
 
06:17:06.410 --> 06:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
so if if a uh respondent believed that
 
06:17:09.770 --> 06:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
reading six U.S Supreme Court cases
 
06:17:13.610 --> 06:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
front to back was favorable to his or
 
06:17:15.048 --> 06:17:15.058 align:start position:0%
her case
 
06:17:16.730 --> 06:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
they could do that I think under this
 
06:17:19.310 --> 06:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
section they could because it requires
 
06:17:21.650 --> 06:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
the court to admit the evidence in any
 
06:17:24.010 --> 06:17:24.020 align:start position:0%
form offered by the respondent
 
06:17:26.990 --> 06:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
and all the respondent has to say is I
 
06:17:28.670 --> 06:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
believe this would be favorable to my
 
06:17:32.930 --> 06:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
case so I think that is it is as written
 
06:17:36.288 --> 06:17:36.298 align:start position:0%
extremely Broad and and does not allow
 
06:17:38.770 --> 06:17:38.780 align:start position:0%
the court to apply any rules but simply
 
06:17:41.270 --> 06:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
requires the court to allow the
 
06:17:43.670 --> 06:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
testimony to occur in whatever form
 
06:17:46.610 --> 06:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
forever however long it may actually
 
06:17:46.620 --> 06:17:47.930 align:start position:0%
forever however long it may actually
take

06:17:47.930 --> 06:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
take
 
06:17:52.490 --> 06:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
with regard to the second uh paragraph
 
06:17:54.530 --> 06:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
um in the amendment which would again
 
06:17:58.368 --> 06:17:58.378 align:start position:0%
apply only to 169 C truthfully I I did
 
06:18:01.788 --> 06:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
not come prepared to I to talk about
 
06:18:05.090 --> 06:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
why it is that the statute
 
06:18:08.030 --> 06:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
in its current form says
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
um that the rules of evidence do not
 
06:18:13.910 --> 06:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
have to apply and there was probably a
 
06:18:16.010 --> 06:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
very good reason back when the when the
 
06:18:19.548 --> 06:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
statute was uh passed
 
06:18:21.708 --> 06:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
um it's been amended a couple times in
 
06:18:26.390 --> 06:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
1979 and 2017 is the most recent and
 
06:18:27.890 --> 06:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
truthfully because I didn't have the
 
06:18:29.628 --> 06:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
amendment I didn't go back through and
 
06:18:32.270 --> 06:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
try to identify exactly what was the
 
06:18:34.490 --> 06:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
concern that was being addressed at the
 
06:18:37.070 --> 06:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
time and I'd be concerned without more
 
06:18:37.080 --> 06:18:39.048 align:start position:0%
time and I'd be concerned without more
information

06:18:39.048 --> 06:18:39.058 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:18:39.058 --> 06:18:40.510 align:start position:0%
information
um

06:18:40.510 --> 06:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:44.270 --> 06:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
that that we do try to identify that and
 
06:18:46.368 --> 06:18:46.378 align:start position:0%
learn as to exactly what was being
 
06:18:46.378 --> 06:18:47.690 align:start position:0%
learn as to exactly what was being
protected

06:18:47.690 --> 06:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
protected
 
06:18:49.670 --> 06:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
that said
 
06:18:49.680 --> 06:18:50.510 align:start position:0%
that said
um

06:18:50.510 --> 06:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:52.250 --> 06:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
in the phrasing of the bill in the
 
06:18:54.350 --> 06:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
waiver language it says if the judge has
 
06:18:55.730 --> 06:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that applying the
 
06:18:57.770 --> 06:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence shall adversely affect
 
06:19:00.350 --> 06:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
the case the judge May waive the Rules
 
06:19:02.570 --> 06:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
of Evidence the judge does not look to
 
06:19:04.910 --> 06:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not information adversely
 
06:19:09.410 --> 06:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
affects a case that's really a uh a
 
06:19:11.930 --> 06:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
litigant's role as to what supports a
 
06:19:15.770 --> 06:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
case the judges is interested in what is
 
06:19:19.548 --> 06:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
um in the best interest of Justice
 
06:19:23.090 --> 06:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
um or or whatever this this the cases
 
06:19:25.368 --> 06:19:25.378 align:start position:0%
that's reformed we're the judge is not
 
06:19:26.990 --> 06:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what is adversely
 
06:19:29.990 --> 06:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
affecting someone's case because that
 
06:19:31.788 --> 06:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
case has to be presented to the judge
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
the judge is not presenting the case to
 
06:19:36.410 --> 06:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
the witness so it should have a standard
 
06:19:38.090 --> 06:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
if there's if this is going to go
 
06:19:41.750 --> 06:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
forward that the waiver would be
 
06:19:43.628 --> 06:19:43.638 align:start position:0%
um that the judge could waive the rules
 
06:19:46.548 --> 06:19:46.558 align:start position:0%
as Justice may require or some of the
 
06:19:49.128 --> 06:19:49.138 align:start position:0%
other more standard language language
 
06:19:51.830 --> 06:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
that you see in the statute under uh
 
06:19:53.448 --> 06:19:53.458 align:start position:0%
providing the court with the authority
 
06:19:57.230 --> 06:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
to waive I would however
 
06:19:59.930 --> 06:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
just pausing that I
 
06:20:01.850 --> 06:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
I would like more time to be able to
 
06:20:05.448 --> 06:20:05.458 align:start position:0%
evaluate exactly why 169 C12 exists in
 
06:20:07.250 --> 06:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
its current form and talk to some judges
 
06:20:10.250 --> 06:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
as to sort of fact circumstances as to
 
06:20:12.830 --> 06:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
as to how it does apply and I'd be happy
 
06:20:14.750 --> 06:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
to supplement uh with the German's
 
06:20:18.170 --> 06:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
permission uh my testimony in writing
 
06:20:19.610 --> 06:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
um with that I would I'd like to give
 
06:20:22.850 --> 06:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
you both a bite at the Apple not now but
 
06:20:25.788 --> 06:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
later on the way towards two weeks from
 
06:20:28.670 --> 06:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
now when we will exec it so to be fair
 
06:20:30.530 --> 06:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
to you to do that I think that would be
 
06:20:32.868 --> 06:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
a good thing to do and in the light of
 
06:20:34.970 --> 06:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
some of these things I think the prime
 
06:20:37.970 --> 06:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
sponsor will have some things to do as
 
06:20:40.128 --> 06:20:40.138 align:start position:0%
well so bring it on both of you and
 
06:20:42.230 --> 06:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
we'll do this in two weeks thank you
 
06:20:44.030 --> 06:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
06:20:47.330 --> 06:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the chair now recognizes uh
 
06:21:01.250 --> 06:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:03.650 --> 06:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee um
 
06:21:05.208 --> 06:21:05.218 align:start position:0%
my name is Keith kenning for the record
 
06:21:07.010 --> 06:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'm the office security director at wake
 
06:21:09.170 --> 06:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
point we sit in opposition of this bill
 
06:21:11.330 --> 06:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
um is written as amended
 
06:21:13.310 --> 06:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
um I would just reiterate everything
 
06:21:16.430 --> 06:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
that um attorney had said we have all
 
06:21:18.230 --> 06:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
the same concerns and the same concerns
 
06:21:20.448 --> 06:21:20.458 align:start position:0%
that representative Raymond has it's
 
06:21:21.770 --> 06:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
particularly concerning the first
 
06:21:24.288 --> 06:21:24.298 align:start position:0%
paragraph I agree in hearing under this
 
06:21:25.670 --> 06:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
chapter the court shall admit any
 
06:21:28.670 --> 06:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
evidence any evidence personal evidence
 
06:21:30.590 --> 06:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
intimate evidence
 
06:21:33.110 --> 06:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
in any form
 
06:21:34.670 --> 06:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
offered by the respondent in the Family
 
06:21:36.770 --> 06:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
Division case was the respondent beliefs
 
06:21:38.510 --> 06:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
will be favorable to his or her case so
 
06:21:40.128 --> 06:21:40.138 align:start position:0%
this is kind of like saying we're going
 
06:21:42.410 --> 06:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
to have baseball rules but in the fifth
 
06:21:44.090 --> 06:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
and sixth inning the visiting team can
 
06:21:45.708 --> 06:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
do whatever they want
 
06:21:47.628 --> 06:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
and the umpires can't do anything about
 
06:21:50.270 --> 06:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
it and that just can't be if you're
 
06:21:51.410 --> 06:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
going to have Rules of Evidence The
 
06:21:52.970 --> 06:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence need to apply equally
 
06:21:55.310 --> 06:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
to everyone I think trying to put the
 
06:21:57.048 --> 06:21:57.058 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence in the family court is
 
06:21:58.490 --> 06:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
literally like trying to put clothes
 
06:22:00.890 --> 06:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
adult clothes on a child there are
 
06:22:03.048 --> 06:22:03.058 align:start position:0%
reasons that they don't apply in a
 
06:22:04.670 --> 06:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
family court there are many things
 
06:22:06.470 --> 06:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
children don't understand from hearsay
 
06:22:08.150 --> 06:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
to other things so you know that's
 
06:22:10.430 --> 06:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
difficult but even if you decide you
 
06:22:11.990 --> 06:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to do that and try to make that
 
06:22:14.090 --> 06:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
work you can't have a system set up that
 
06:22:15.830 --> 06:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
the respondent decides what goes into
 
06:22:17.750 --> 06:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
the record and the judge just has no
 
06:22:19.850 --> 06:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
ability to stop that I just I don't see
 
06:22:21.948 --> 06:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
how the court system I agree with Mr
 
06:22:23.750 --> 06:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
head you know somebody could decide to
 
06:22:25.730 --> 06:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
go on for eight days admitting evidence
 
06:22:27.948 --> 06:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
it'd be nothing the judge could do if if
 
06:22:30.048 --> 06:22:30.058 align:start position:0%
the respondent said I consider this
 
06:22:31.910 --> 06:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
relevant so I find this very concerning
 
06:22:33.890 --> 06:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to say so thank you
 
06:22:35.750 --> 06:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
very much thank you will you take any
 
06:22:37.788 --> 06:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
questions sure are there any questions
 
06:22:40.448 --> 06:22:40.458 align:start position:0%
for him to take
 
06:22:42.530 --> 06:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford without having
 
06:22:44.448 --> 06:22:44.458 align:start position:0%
to clear your throat
 
06:22:47.150 --> 06:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
 
06:22:49.368 --> 06:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
um you said that Rules of Evidence
 
06:22:51.470 --> 06:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
should not apply I believe that's what
 
06:22:53.570 --> 06:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
you said Family Court
 
06:22:55.610 --> 06:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
currently I don't believe all the rules
 
06:22:57.048 --> 06:22:57.058 align:start position:0%
of voting so they do not apply to family
 
06:22:58.850 --> 06:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
court for for various reasons and you
 
06:23:01.310 --> 06:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
think yes thank you for the question
 
06:23:02.750 --> 06:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but go ahead I'm sorry I interrupted
 
06:23:05.990 --> 06:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
you no that uh I was concerned about
 
06:23:07.788 --> 06:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
where you're going with that you use the
 
06:23:10.190 --> 06:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
terminology about adult clothes on a
 
06:23:12.850 --> 06:23:12.860 align:start position:0%
child but I'm trying to understand
 
06:23:17.330 --> 06:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
what rules do apply which ones don't and
 
06:23:19.250 --> 06:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
just to understand the
 
06:23:20.628 --> 06:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
the issue here
 
06:23:22.250 --> 06:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question my
 
06:23:24.470 --> 06:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is and I'm I can guarantee
 
06:23:25.970 --> 06:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
you I'm not the perfect person to ask
 
06:23:27.830 --> 06:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
this question I just know there's more
 
06:23:29.868 --> 06:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the family courts in
 
06:23:32.208 --> 06:23:32.218 align:start position:0%
order to in order to accommodate the
 
06:23:34.010 --> 06:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
needs of the family court that are
 
06:23:36.470 --> 06:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
different from a normal court system and
 
06:23:38.810 --> 06:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
so as I said if the committee decided
 
06:23:40.250 --> 06:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
they wanted to apply the Rules of
 
06:23:42.410 --> 06:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
Evidence perhaps that's something that
 
06:23:44.628 --> 06:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
we should you could look into but you
 
06:23:46.128 --> 06:23:46.138 align:start position:0%
can't apply the rules of evidence and
 
06:23:47.930 --> 06:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
then say but it doesn't apply in certain
 
06:23:50.510 --> 06:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
situations yeah I got that yeah okay
 
06:23:54.490 --> 06:23:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:57.410 --> 06:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you so
 
06:24:00.170 --> 06:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
much and making the assumption that the
 
06:24:02.030 --> 06:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
card that representative Betty gay
 
06:24:04.810 --> 06:24:04.820 align:start position:0%
handed in has her name on it
 
06:24:07.368 --> 06:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
I'm good at this I will call
 
06:24:16.730 --> 06:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:18.590 --> 06:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
hey Betty K
 
06:24:20.150 --> 06:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:24:23.208 --> 06:24:23.218 align:start position:0%
I have a very my interpretation of this
 
06:24:26.628 --> 06:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
is that Roman numeral two is really
 
06:24:28.628 --> 06:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
really important
 
06:24:32.750 --> 06:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
and what what I would do is I wouldn't
 
06:24:35.150 --> 06:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
have one and two I'd have two well
 
06:24:38.390 --> 06:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
renumber it and it would say
 
06:24:40.190 --> 06:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
in all proceedings under this chapter
 
06:24:42.110 --> 06:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
the court shall apply the New Hampshire
 
06:24:45.830 --> 06:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence to any evidence or
 
06:24:48.708 --> 06:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
testimony in any form offered by the
 
06:24:50.628 --> 06:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
respondent in a Family Division case
 
06:24:52.788 --> 06:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
which the respondent believes will be
 
06:24:55.490 --> 06:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
favorable to his or her case
 
06:24:58.430 --> 06:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
to enhance the predictable orderly fair
 
06:25:02.090 --> 06:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
and reliable presentation of evidence
 
06:25:05.150 --> 06:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
to me that's what it's really saying we
 
06:25:12.110 --> 06:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
we want to allow the court the judge
 
06:25:12.120 --> 06:25:13.548 align:start position:0%
we want to allow the court the judge
to

06:25:13.548 --> 06:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:25:15.288 --> 06:25:15.298 align:start position:0%
study anything
 
06:25:18.170 --> 06:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
and apply the rules and if he thinks
 
06:25:21.350 --> 06:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to make the case not it's
 
06:25:23.390 --> 06:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
going to twist the case you know
 
06:25:25.548 --> 06:25:25.558 align:start position:0%
applying the exact wording
 
06:25:29.690 --> 06:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
then he gets to gets to uh uh change it
 
06:25:33.048 --> 06:25:33.058 align:start position:0%
and shall note in the file the rationale
 
06:25:36.048 --> 06:25:36.058 align:start position:0%
we really would like records of when
 
06:25:40.368 --> 06:25:40.378 align:start position:0%
rules are changed so to me Roman
 
06:25:42.590 --> 06:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
numerals 2 says everything and what
 
06:25:45.530 --> 06:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral says is could be included
 
06:25:47.990 --> 06:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
in that sentence it's just that you have
 
06:25:50.570 --> 06:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
the right to submit anything but the
 
06:25:52.788 --> 06:25:52.798 align:start position:0%
judge is going to apply the rules of
 
06:25:56.030 --> 06:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
evidence and has the freedom to dis to
 
06:25:59.090 --> 06:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
disregard the exact letter of the law of
 
06:26:01.970 --> 06:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
evidence as long as they know why they
 
06:26:03.490 --> 06:26:03.500 align:start position:0%
did it
 
06:26:05.990 --> 06:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
come on
 
06:26:08.570 --> 06:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
give representative hole a call tonight
 
06:26:10.610 --> 06:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
would you because he had to leave okay
 
06:26:13.128 --> 06:26:13.138 align:start position:0%
any questions on that
 
06:26:16.128 --> 06:26:16.138 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none seeing no one with a
 
06:26:18.288 --> 06:26:18.298 align:start position:0%
pink card running up to get it under the
 
06:26:18.298 --> 06:26:22.670 align:start position:0%
pink card running up to get it under the
deadline

06:26:22.670 --> 06:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:22.680 --> 06:26:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
no

06:26:23.750 --> 06:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:26:25.548 --> 06:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a request
 
06:26:29.448 --> 06:26:29.458 align:start position:0%
thank you close the hearing on 499
 
06:26:31.548 --> 06:26:31.558 align:start position:0%
you could have you know I mean you could
 
06:26:34.788 --> 06:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:37.910 --> 06:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that's it for the day and have fun
 
06:26:40.850 --> 06:26:40.860 align:start position:0%

and maybe Thursday snowstorm
