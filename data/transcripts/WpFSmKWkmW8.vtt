absolutely

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
first action for the day
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm is that 577
 
00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
so welcome
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
um been delayed a little bit with uh
 
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
getting some of our uh normal paperwork
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
that we need for hearings and exec
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
sessions but uh I think we're ready for
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing on uh House Bill 654 which
 
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
is relative to the one-year certificate
 
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
certificate of teaching eligibility and
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh call on uh representative layout to
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
present the Bill thank you very much uh
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli and members of
 
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
Rick Ladd I come from Haverhill New
 
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that's graphed in five uh
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
we have a number of communities which
 
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
are in that number five now landath
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
Piermont Warren Pier um
 
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
Benton Haverhill I think I got them
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
um what we have here performs today is
 
00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
654 is a bill relative to the one-year
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
certification of teacher teaching
 
00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.290 align:start position:0%
certification of teacher teaching
eligibility

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
and the reason why this bill is before
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
you it went before the
 
00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
the committee which we have here for
 
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
allowing late legislation to come
 
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.390 align:start position:0%
allowing late legislation to come
forward

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
and it's late legislation that came in
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that we have another
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
committee that's very active and we need
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
to even gear it up seeing we lost our
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
our chairman and now we have to have
 
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
another chairman for the teacher
 
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
shortage committee identified and it's a
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
Senate bill so the Senate has to
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
identify the chairman or for identify
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
the people are going to be on it so at
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
any rate this bill is one where we're
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
trying to look at the situation which we
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
have with the teacher shortage which is
 
00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 align:start position:0%
a very real situation in our state
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
especially in the areas of Science in
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
mathematics and special education and
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
within science you can also Link in
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
technical support or technical uh
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
aspects of teaching and in support so
 
00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do to try to get
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
past this and and support getting more
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
people into the field of education so
 
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
this is just one just one of the options
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
which we have available to rectify this
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage or to support us in in
 
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
getting somebody in the classroom that
 
00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
has certification that may be a little
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
bit different certification than the
 
00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
certification which we would normally
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
have for a chemistry teacher in the high
 
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.870 align:start position:0%
have for a chemistry teacher in the high
school

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like to explain uh how this
 
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.110 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like to explain uh how this
works

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
we may have a shortage in in school
 
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
district Y and it might be a science
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
teacher and yet they can't find somebody
 
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
with the credential or the certification
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
in that specific area it's a very
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
specific area of instruction which you
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
need to have that background information
 
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
and and so but we have another way of
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
doing it when you get to the front door
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
School the two days before school starts
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
and there's not a teacher available for
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
chemistry what do you do
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
so this legislation that we're talking
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
about this area of Statute 189 39b was
 
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
put into place a number of years ago so
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
hire a person that had a bachelor's
 
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.809 align:start position:0%
hire a person that had a bachelor's
degree

00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
had a criminal background check and that
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
came out fine and had some understanding
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
and experience or understanding of the
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
of the subject of chemistry so that that
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
person could get the local
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
superintendent can do this
 
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
but the limit of time is just one year
 
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:43.700 align:start position:0%
and so you have a one-year
 
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
certification to do this
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
what this bill also does is that even in
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
the one year it also says this teacher
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
this person is certified must be held
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
accountable to the professional code of
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
ethics and professional code of conduct
 
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.750 align:start position:0%
ethics and professional code of conduct
um

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
this is put in there just so it's
 
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
understood I believe that when it comes
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
right down to the rulemaking authority
 
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education which is
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
already establishes that I think we
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
already have it but this identifies it
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
and there shouldn't be any concerns now
 
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
in that regard every teacher must comply
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
with that code and I think that's
 
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
supported by Administration and staff
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
and teachers within the building as well
 
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
but getting back to the top part of this
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
there this one year is one where a
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
person may be identified we may identify
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage and they come in
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
let's say in November
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
that one-year ticket is good for one
 
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
year November to November
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that then extends into the
 
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
next school year and they have somebody
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's done an excellent job and has
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
said I really want to become a teacher
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
in this system I have now gotten into a
 
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
course either at one of the four years
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
to get the credential done properly but
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
you and I know that you can't do this in
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
one short year or even a half a year
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
after they get in the class and make
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
decision I want to go on so this
 
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
one-year extension allows that
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
individual to do that it also affords
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity that you don't have as
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
much change going into the classroom uh
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
when you have somebody really is doing
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
the job for you as an administrator I
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
would say well I'd like to be able to
 
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
keep this person although I want to
 
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
ensure that the basic standards that we
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
have for certification are applied to
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
this Pathway to certification
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
I've also received and you have in front
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
of you a this communication came to us
 
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
just yesterday from
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
Steve Appleby from doe behind us and
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
there's some changes there which I'm
 
00:10:58.009 --> 00:10:58.019 align:start position:0%
going to let him speak to where this the
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
way the legislation's written right now
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
it says teaching educator we have some
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
other certified people they're not
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
necessarily teaching they could be
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
supporting in technical support excuse
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
me representative um are there copies of
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah I've seen copies on both sides
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be coming down
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
is that copy just the amended version
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
that you see you passed around not your
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
testimony this is draft language it's
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
not an amendment we haven't gotten the
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
amendment back from OLS but this is the
 
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
draft that I got from the DOE
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay last night this is done okay here
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
we go
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
so there should be copies out there for
 
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.310 align:start position:0%
so there should be copies out there for
everybody

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
okay rather than my taking you through
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
this I'm going to have director Appleby
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
do that these are some changes that
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
they're seeing that if we add these
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
changes it it's going to really support
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
those people in some schools that really
 
00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:05.579 align:start position:0%
need to be able to do this they're going
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
to have the the wherewithal the
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
statutory language behind them to do it
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
so I'd be glad to take any questions
 
00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:14.839 align:start position:0%
from the committee at this time
 
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
please leave any questions to this one
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
to the department which is going to
 
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.509 align:start position:0%
to the department which is going to
follow

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative miler thank you
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I think also you uh representative
 
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
lad you mentioned the content area
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
problems but also in the isn't it true
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
that in the teacher shortage uh
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
committee we also identified problems of
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
rural school districts retaining
 
00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:44.459 align:start position:0%
teachers as well as underperforming
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
schools retaining teachers and that was
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
also part of the conversation above and
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
beyond just the content areas that you
 
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned yes and I had we had one other
 
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
area representative Miler yes rural
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
location is an issue underperforming is
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
an issue but poverty is also an issue
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
there's a direct relationship between
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
the level of poverty in the community
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the achievement of students and so
 
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.730 align:start position:0%
and the achievement of students and so
and

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
you and I know that if I were looking
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
for a job I would certainly look for a
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
job which is going to pay ten thousand
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
dollars more per year than the one that
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
may be local so rather than working in
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
Haverhill I try to trip down and get a
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
job in Lebanon or Hanover
 
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
and that's happening in my district and
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
I know it's happening all over the state
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
so there are three areas and these are
 
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
three critical areas that must be
 
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
addressed and this is just one of many
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
of the ideas that come out of the
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage committee and that's an
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
active committee still working towards
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
trying to develop some resolution to
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
when we encountered this in future years
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
we have a methodology to try to address
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
it and also to ensure the pool of people
 
00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
with certification is there for us in
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
this state we lose a lot of our folks
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Tanner
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
has any uh effort been made to look at
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
uh or to ask these people that are on
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
these one or two year uh teaching
 
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.170 align:start position:0%
these one or two year uh teaching
certificate

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh to go licenses
 
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.180 align:start position:0%
um to actually be
 
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
trying to get certification to actually
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
be in the process of trying to get
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
certification through some of the other
 
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
methods that you can get certification
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
yes and I that's ongoing and you notice
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
that there's while you may have received
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
an email from the Department just the
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
other evening I don't know if everybody
 
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
got it where if you average out the
 
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
number of of folks that are attempting
 
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
to get this resolved through this
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
one-year teacher certification spout 140
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
people a year roughly 100 to 150 in that
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
neighborhood out of the total number of
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
certification which we have in the State
 
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.949 align:start position:0%
certification which we have in the State
28

00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
28
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
000 so we're talking really a small
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
number over top but this is just another
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox for the school
 
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
district to open the doors with somebody
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the classroom that has expertise in
 
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
the area we're looking for
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
a representative luno
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
 
00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:16.730 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
Vlad

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
Vlad
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
um this may be maybe it's a question for
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
you maybe it's a question for Mr Appleby
 
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.889 align:start position:0%
you maybe it's a question for Mr Appleby
when

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
um uh from the Department on on this but
 
00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:28.019 align:start position:0%
of the 150-ish
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
employed under this under the existing
 
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
statute are are those
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
um and and I know nope what what you
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
handed out refers it makes some other
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
um there's some other language changes
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
in here referring to them as Educators
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
not teachers which which makes and I
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
think you I ought to vacate that
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
question too okay yeah no that's
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
director I think that he has a knowledge
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
what's going on and he's working very
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
closely with several districts right now
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
in and trying to help them out have the
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
people in place so and that's a good
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
question I think I know where you're
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
going no I'm happy to I'm having to take
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
that up at the same thanks
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for my
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.389 align:start position:0%
question representative
um

00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
my concern is to make sure there's
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
safeguards here so this doesn't become
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
the practice the standard practice
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
because I fear that we're going to start
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think that we need that
 
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
second year of Eligibility without a
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
doubt you go north of the Notch and buy
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
any newspaper there's a zillion jobs you
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%
could walk into today if you were
 
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:45.500 align:start position:0%
licensed I just don't want it to be
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
an acceptable practice for a person to
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
start with a two-year
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
and now we're making exceptions because
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
they're there three years four years and
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
what quality are we providing to the
 
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
kids so I would want some safeguards and
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
maybe the code of ethics or the code of
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
conduct is gonna
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
or some checks and balances on whether
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
they are moving through a program uh UNH
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
is great about their teacher rule
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
program produces great teachers off-site
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's another North Country teacher
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
program I mean these are resources that
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
I would suspect
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
school districts all over the state have
 
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
um in some fashion so somebody needs to
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
Mentor that candidate to make sure
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
they're working towards a teacher degree
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
if that is their chosen pathway I think
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and I I believe
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
that Mr can really help you out with
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
that but one other part of this you
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
can't just go for a certification like
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
this for one year and then two years
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
later that person comes in with no this
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
is worded so it has to be consecutive at
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
abutting the year that you issued the
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
first one in okay following that so that
 
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
is putting a little control on it and I
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
agree with you I'm I'm I see this as
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
just an emergency route which we can
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
take and I believe when I talked with
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
the superintendents this last Monday at
 
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
the conference over at Grappone they
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
they see this as just that that they
 
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
want to have somebody in with the CR the
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
certification in the ways now I'm not
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
talking CTE because CTE is a totally
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
different ball game here so um they
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
understand this I don't don't truthfully
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen any real abuse on that I
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
think most your administrator
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
superintendents are aware of this they
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
try to get somebody it's just like well
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
this is a CTE situation where Chris
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
Dodge had down in Salem and person hired
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
three days before took off for a job
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
that doubled his salary elsewhere in
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
Kansas or in the midwest you know he it
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
was a tech type oriented position and
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
going from that at the max at Chris
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
Dodge could the director of CT and Salem
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
could offer was right around seventy
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a person went out and
 
00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
doubled the salary
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.850 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
um

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
is there any thought about maybe these
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
this candidate taking the Praxis one as
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
all teacher candidates need after
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
semester two I believe are required to
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
take a basic skills
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
test before they go on into the prep
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
program or would you ask that question
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
too I will yes that this is Steve's
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
my question there are actually two
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if and I appreciate the
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
numbers currently our small 142 150. but
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there's any
 
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
statement made about how many people
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
teaching through this credential a
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
particular system could have at the same
 
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.370 align:start position:0%
particular system could have at the same
time

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
are you saying that you might have an
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
elementary teacher that wants to teach
 
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:54.500 align:start position:0%
in the high school and doesn't have a
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
credential for high school no I'm sorry
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
I wasn't clear
 
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
I'm saying what percentage of teaching
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
staff in a particular School
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
at one point in time could be teaching
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
in this way I think experience would it
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
would come from Steve Appleby on that I
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
I don't have I I don't want to guess at
 
00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:16.390 align:start position:0%
I don't have I I don't want to guess at
that

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify the meaning of
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
line 24
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
is that saying that a particular
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
individual can only do this once in one
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
District or is it saying something else
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
this is controlled by Department of
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
Education they don't care where you are
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
in what school it's once one time only
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
and this that's a requirement for this
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
we have different alternative Pathways
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
towards certification this is one of
 
00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:44.510 align:start position:0%
towards certification this is one of
those

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
and it's controlled by Doe very closely
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
represent painter
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
um I actually got into a little
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
discussion with some people up in my
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
area I think it was that earlier this
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
summer and uh on this subject and they
 
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
were uh trying to see if there was they
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
were talking about retired teachers
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
bringing retired teachers back and
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
whether there was going to be an
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
incentive for them to do it because
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
right now it's a disincentive
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
um as far as the retirement uh system
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know is set up and that sort of
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
thing and has any was any discussion
 
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
made about bringing retired teachers
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
back in there has been a lot of
 
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
discussion I see representative going
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
yeah like that on the teacher shortage
 
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059 align:start position:0%
committee we've talked about retirement
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
we've had the retirement folks in to
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
explain how that system works so how
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
many hours that a retired employee is
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
allowed to work in the classroom that's
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
something that I know uh Steve Appley is
 
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
very aware of how many hours is that
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
about 30 hours per
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
29.5 I was 0.5 off that there are
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
allowed to teach over the course of the
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
year and of course that's to if you're
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
retired we are looking at that we know
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of retired teachers out
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
there that are you know maybe interested
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
in in coming back and helping out in a
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
shortage or it will just retire too
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
early and they're saying I want to get
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
back in the game and and so but they're
 
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
also collecting retirement at the same
 
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
time then you start talking about
 
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
benefits and all that other from the
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
state and what they're going to get at
 
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
the system we've had that same issue
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
with municipal government and when it
 
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
comes to Corrections some of the retires
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
as a state trooper wants to come back
 
00:22:29.649 --> 00:22:29.659 align:start position:0%
and work as a corrections officer
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
retirement is always something that's
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
got to be considered this one has to be
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
considered and it is possible that you
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
could do that but you're you have a
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
limitless how much you can work so an
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
average day what's five five and a half
 
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
hours of teaching multiply that times
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
five you come underneath that 29.5 so
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
you can do that
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:54.539 align:start position:0%
um so I one of the concerns was that
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
um you know by the time you retire
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have multiple
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
certifications in multiple different
 
00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:00.770 align:start position:0%
certifications in multiple different
subjects

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
subjects
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
if you retire and say you know you don't
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
let you don't renew your certification
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
um did they discuss it all about we've
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
discussed that on that committee as well
 
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
yeah a lot of people let that lapse and
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
then you know any further questions for
 
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad I've seen none thank
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
you very much and we'll call uh Stephen
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
good morning representatives for the
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
record Stephen Appleby from Auburn New
 
00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am the director of educator
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
support and higher education at the
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:52.250 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I'll make a couple of points and then
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'll answer questions I think
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
um some some pieces and I'll try and
 
00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
address some of what I was hearing for
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd
 
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.350 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd
um

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
we ran some numbers which I shared with
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative lad which I think he can
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
disseminate but over the last five years
 
00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:13.220 align:start position:0%
um we have issued beginning in the
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
2018-2019 uh year we issued 85 the
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
following year 1920 we issued 83 uh 2021
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
the first year of the pandemic we issued
 
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.409 align:start position:0%
the first year of the pandemic we issued
143

00:24:26.409 --> 00:24:26.419 align:start position:0%
143
 
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
2021-2022 we issued 152 and this year to
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
date we've issued 136 of these it's
 
00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:36.179 align:start position:0%
important to note that once an
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
individual currently in the current
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
system is issued one of these one-year
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
certificates they can never get another
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
one it goes into our licensure system
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
and if they try and go to another
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
District in a couple of years and that
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
District asks us for one we have to
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
inform that District that they've
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
already used that one in the previous
 
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
year so they can't skip a couple of
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
years and come back it's a one-time only
 
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
per person
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
as it stands today forever
 
00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.510 align:start position:0%
as it stands today forever
so

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and with the wording in the bill this
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
would extend it to a second consecutive
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
year within the district they're already
 
00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:08.870 align:start position:0%
year within the district they're already
in

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
and as as representative Ladd mentioned
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes folks are hired mid-year this
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
is often used as well
 
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:18.500 align:start position:0%
um when they have an unexpected
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
long-term absence from an educator so
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
for example I was speaking yesterday
 
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
with Hollis Brookline they had an
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
educator go out on leave long-term
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
medical leave in the fall they utilized
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
the one-year certificate to bring
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
someone into cover
 
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
they really like the individual
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
but that individual doesn't qualify yet
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
for a statement of Eligibility which
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
puts them on the site-based pathway uh
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
where they go on an intern license
 
00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:47.210 align:start position:0%
where they go on an intern license
essentially

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
um but they really like the individual
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
and they want to do a second year
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
because lo and behold this teacher is
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
going to be out it looks like again and
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
they would like to keep that consistency
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
and keep that individual and they will
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
use that second year to get them
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
converted over to the intern
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
authorization process
 
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.390 align:start position:0%
authorization process
so

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
um that's typically the pathway for
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
districts they bring someone in because
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's an emergency and if they like
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
that individual they then help them get
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
qualified for an intern authorization
 
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
and they start on that alternative
 
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.289 align:start position:0%
and they start on that alternative
pathway

00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
pathway
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
um to full licensure so
 
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
um questions I'm representative luno so
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thanks very
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
much Steve for uh for joining us this
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
morning and being able to take some uh
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
technical questions on this when you
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
were just referring to we issued what
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
what were you talking about so
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
um there are administrative rules which
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
instruct the Bureau of credentialing to
 
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
process the school board has to notify
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
the department and we take that
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
notification and process a one-year
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
certificate we called emergency
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
authorization an administrative rule but
 
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
and then we track that oh okay yeah and
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
a follow-up on that so so the way the
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
current law seems to read to me is that
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
the local school board
 
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.570 align:start position:0%
the local school board
um

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
um uh issues the Certificate of
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
Eligibility and then just for
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
clarification that well it says in the
 
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
statute they notify the department then
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
the Department issues a we call it an
 
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization emergency and
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's our way of tracking it and
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
complying okay and then and then and so
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
that was really sort of clarification
 
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
the follow-up is um is really for the
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
for the second year
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
um under the current law
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
um could could somebody
 
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
um uh could a person who's who's
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
employed under the emergency
 
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.490 align:start position:0%
employed under the emergency
authorization

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:45.500 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
request a um uh what is it what is it
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
called in the doe and ALT
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
um oh a statement of Eligibility yeah
 
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
yeah could they operate for a second
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
year they under under alt without
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
changing the law
 
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
so the the issue uh they could but they
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
would have to meet now the requirements
 
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
of whatever endorsement that they're
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
pursuing the entry level requirements so
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
um and in order if they
 
00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:18.059 align:start position:0%
um sort by backup uh the alternative
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
Pathways that used to be called We Now
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
call it site-based licensing program
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
um those individuals applied to the
 
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
department for what's called a statement
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
of Eligibility to the Bureau of
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
credentialing and we review their
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
qualifications typically academic
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
history have they taken Praxis core to
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
show basic academic skills we review all
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
of those and if they meet those for the
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
given endorsement let's say chemistry
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
teacher we issue them what's called a
 
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
statement of Eligibility they then take
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
that statement of Eligibility and they
 
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
go to districts and they interview and
 
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
if a district says we want to hire you
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
the district then contacts the
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
department on their behalf to seek an
 
00:28:59.810 --> 00:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
intern authorization
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
and the district files what we call the
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of plan which is their
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
development plan and that can that plan
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
can be one year in length to meet the
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
requirements or it can be up to three
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
years in length most individuals it
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
takes them a year to two years very few
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
you know some go three years but many
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh one to two years so
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
um the the one-year Certificate of
 
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
Eligibility is is almost a Runway if you
 
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
will towards that
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and because sometimes some of the
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
endorsements may require 10 classes in
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
that subject area and that individual
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
may not have them right
 
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.870 align:start position:0%
may not have them right
um

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
so that that this gives the district
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
time again to you know try before we buy
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
do we do we think this individual is a
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
fit and has the quality you know the the
 
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
skills the disposition to be an educator
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
um they can say okay now we're going to
 
00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
keep them the the other issue that that
 
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
comes up and again I was talking to hola
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
Sportline yesterday and they were
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
talking about you know when a teacher or
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
an educator unexpectedly goes out on
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
leave and then they come back
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
but maybe they relapse or they have some
 
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.059 align:start position:0%
other medical and they go back out
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
and so we had someone on a one year they
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
came in they covered
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
that one year expires over the summer
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
that educator comes back and three weeks
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
into school they leave again
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
they want to reach back out to that
 
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.190 align:start position:0%
they want to reach back out to that
person

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
and perhaps now keep them but you know
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
the giving them the extra year
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
um the district was very much in favor
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
of because they feel that it gives them
 
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
flexibility okay great thank you very
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
much for the questions from the
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
committee representative Tanner
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you I whenever I am involved in
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
the discussion of certified teachers
 
00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
versus non-certified teachers
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
I'm I've flashed back to several
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
instances and and they're rare but they
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
were instances where people didn't have
 
00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
the temperament to teach came in on a
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
one-year certificate and something you
 
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
know they blew up at a kid or even maybe
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
assaulted a kid
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
um and you know if you're certified and
 
00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
you've gone through teacher training not
 
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
only do you learn the you know how to
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
handle adolescents and some psychology
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
and you learn teaching methods and you
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
are also screened during your student
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
teaching for temperament and and you
 
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
learn the laws of the regulate
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
um you know teaching in in the public
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
schools and over the years when we've
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
talked about sex education and and I was
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
a health teacher so I had that field uh
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
in my toolbox and
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
outrageous things happened I had to say
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
that it was probably somebody that
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
didn't have the training that I had and
 
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
so I really value that that training
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
that a certified teacher has the process
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
that they go through I also worked with
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
the Department a couple times on
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
alternative licensing and didn't feel in
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
in several cases that
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
what we prescribed was adequate to
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
prepare somebody for for actually being
 
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
in the classroom
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
I take
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
um representative cascadden's remarks
 
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
very much to heart that I think that
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
they should be uh involved with some
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
program where there's mentoring
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
um and that I I hope that and you know
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
and to leave it up to the school I don't
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
know if that's because superintendents
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
and principals are so overburdened but
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
you know to have a mentor in in the
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
school uh that's actually monitoring
 
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%
things to to kind of short-circuit any
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
things that are going to blow up
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
um and I'm wondering if I guess my
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
do you feel
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
can you
 
00:32:59.159 --> 00:33:00.110 align:start position:0%
can you
um

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
do you feel that my concerns are being
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
met in in doing this uh Bill the way it
 
00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
is and allowing that second year of of
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:15.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to just make sure I get to
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
the core of what you are mentioning you
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
know so I've been at the department for
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
five years and I have we have not had a
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
misconduct issue involving an individual
 
00:33:33.409 --> 00:33:33.419 align:start position:0%
on a one-year certificate in the five
 
00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:36.059 align:start position:0%
years I've been there
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
um we've had misconduct issues of course
 
00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
with licensed Educators we've had
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
misconduct issues with Educators who are
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
um going work on an intern authorization
 
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
but we have not had one to my knowledge
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
for someone on a one year
 
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.090 align:start position:0%
for someone on a one year
um

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:52.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if that would come rise to
 
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
your level that uh you know that if
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're on a one-year certificate or
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
just brand new kind of in the first day
 
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
I we've had people come in and walk out
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
in the first day you know I mean
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
so I just right they have no idea what
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's like facing 30 high school kids or
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
Elementary you know first graders right
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
so I would just say from from a
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
geographic standpoint our investigator
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
um we you know speak daily about
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:32.930 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
I would know yeah I'm pretty confident
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
that I would know if they were on that
 
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.089 align:start position:0%
that I would know if they were on that
um

00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
so and I think it's important
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
um to note that again we have 28 000
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
individuals that hold a license
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
Statewide from the Department of
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
Education of that 28 000 uh several
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
thousand hold what we call a license for
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
life that the department used to issue
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
or the State Board you stationed many
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
years ago they never expire but those
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
folks typically are retired by now so
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
and I see representative Heath shaking
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
your head
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
um she remembers those
 
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
um so if we say there's 25 to 26 000 now
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
that hold a license again several
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
thousand of those folks are not in New
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're in other states maybe
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
they went to school here and they got
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
their license here and then they
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
relocated so now we're down to say let's
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
say 23 24
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
000 individuals well again some number
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
of those are administrators or not t not
 
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.490 align:start position:0%
of those are administrators or not t not
working

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
so maybe there's eighteen thousand
 
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
seventeen thousand teachers I did reach
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
out to the Nea to see if they had some
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
numbers on teachers
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
um and and they were looking into that
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
but if we say 17 or 18 000 teachers
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
um you know Educators not administrators
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
but all of the support rules and and the
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
teachers then I think those numbers of
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
100 to 150 a year
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
are really really small and I know the
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
question came up earlier about in any
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
one District I think it's important to
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
note that we have 107 saus and about
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
500-ish public schools in our state K-12
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
and we're get you know issuing less than
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
a third of that number annually so
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
um there could be two in a particular
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
but I I think
 
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know the numbers for sure
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
but I would be surprised if there's more
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
than a couple in a particular SAU at any
 
00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:20.510 align:start position:0%
than a couple in a particular SAU at any
time

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative miler
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
being here this morning
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
I've got three three quick questions how
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
many of these
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
individuals go on and seek a teaching
 
00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.170 align:start position:0%
individuals go on and seek a teaching
certificate

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
many many do many I don't have an exact
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
number but it's more often than not okay
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh set out second question is you use
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
the term in here educator
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh could you explain why you use that
 
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
term rather than like instructor or why
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
that particular term so we have made a
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
concerted effort over the last five
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
years to be consistent in our language
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
when describing positions historically
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at throughout the education
 
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.630 align:start position:0%
if you look at throughout the education
statutes

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
you know we even use the word the the
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
term superintendent very Loosely if you
 
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
go by Statute every school building in
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
our state is supposed to have a super
 
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.690 align:start position:0%
our state is supposed to have a super
superintendent

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
um so we've been trying at least in the
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau of credentialing in my area to
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
clean up our language so that it it
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
statured and Rule match and it and it
 
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
says what we want it to say and it
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't just imply something so by my my
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
suggested Amendment to the chair
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
um by changing that to educator we now
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
not only cover just teachers but we
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
cover folks like digital learning
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
Specialists Librarians some of those
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
support roles that districts have have
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
also had trouble with
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
um so we at which sometimes as well have
 
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
very high bars to entry
 
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
one more and final question I'm assuming
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
that these individuals under this
 
00:37:56.329 --> 00:37:56.339 align:start position:0%
certificate fall under the collective
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement of the local school
 
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
district is that correct
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
I could not I do not know so that would
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
be an employment question so perhaps
 
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.730 align:start position:0%
be an employment question so perhaps
um

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:09.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you uh
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden thank you Mr
 
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
chair uh just double checking so a
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
candidate who's on a one-year emergency
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
waiver then goes through the
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
site-based plan technically has four
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
years to get their license as a teacher
 
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
well once they're on the site-based that
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
they've got three years so let's say
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
they're halfway through their one-year
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
certificate and they apply for an intern
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
authorization now it's time now it's
 
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
three years so so it could be three and
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
a half right and usually that comes at
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
the expense of that candidate so
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
whatever's on their plan they have to
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
take so many courses they have to do so
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
many field work so by going with this
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
additional year technically gives them a
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
five-year potential
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
if they're a good candidate which they
 
00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:02.099 align:start position:0%
incur the cost so this buys them an
 
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
extra year I mean college courses aren't
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
cheap so I just want to double check
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
that that might be a path that would
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
entice people to work towards teacher
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
certification if they never could afford
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
it right I think okay I think that's
 
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.190 align:start position:0%
it right I think okay I think that's
correct

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.230 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
Damon

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:23.579 align:start position:0%
not sure if this is a question for you
 
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
or for the Bill's sponsor
 
00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
but reflecting on both representative
 
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
cascadden and represented Tanner's
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
remarks and I wrote the word Mentor
 
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
right before you said it
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
could there be language in the revision
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
of the bill to require districts to
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
designate a particular mentor
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
for these individuals as opposed to just
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
generically saying that they will be
 
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.150 align:start position:0%
generically saying that they will be
helped

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't know if I could answer
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
I there could be
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm not sure
 
00:40:06.359 --> 00:40:09.470 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm not sure
um

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
what would be our mechanism to ensure
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
from I'm just thinking practically
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
because again in my world the Bureau of
 
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
credential where you know we if there's
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
a rule we have to have some way to make
 
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
sure it's followed
 
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.430 align:start position:0%
sure it's followed
um

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.930 align:start position:0%
um
follow

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:33.260 align:start position:0%
I think it would be that the person
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
identified as the mentor in the school
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
would that would need to be communicated
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
to doe in that 30 day when they submit
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
we have this person who's coming into
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
the system in this way
 
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.510 align:start position:0%
the system in this way
um

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned that obviously the
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
existing educator staff is extremely
 
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.589 align:start position:0%
existing educator staff is extremely
busy

00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
busy
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
and people certainly intend to be
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
helpful but there's a difference between
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
generally having people you can find
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
somebody to ask a question of versus
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
having a mentoring relationship with
 
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.490 align:start position:0%
having a mentoring relationship with
somebody

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
who is more closely connected to how
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
that one individual is progressing
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I particularly think it's important
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
because as I'm pretty sure we'd all
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
agree you can be very very knowledgeable
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
in a subject area and not be skilled at
 
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.609 align:start position:0%
in a subject area and not be skilled at
teaching

00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh anything any further questions
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for letting me
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
ask a question thank you Steve for being
 
00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:34.970 align:start position:0%
ask a question thank you Steve for being
here

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
um we have wonderful teacher education
 
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
facilities in our state they're fabulous
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
has any consideration been given to when
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
um an individual is is
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
um hired by a district that may be
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
um some kind of an arrangement could be
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
made with one of the existing teacher Ed
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
programs some kind of a contract or
 
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
something that they would oversee
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
because I agree teachers are overwhelmed
 
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on in our Public
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
Schools but at the same time teaching is
 
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
hard and um either a mentor or
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
I think it would be preferable to have
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
someone from an academic institution be
 
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
working with the CTE would that be a
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
possibility that something could be
 
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
um considered to uh put that kind of a
 
00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
I don't see why not
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
um but but I also would say that there
 
00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:41.579 align:start position:0%
are occasions they're less often but
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
there are occasions where a district may
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
use this and they use it for four months
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
because an individual is out for a short
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
period but longer than the substitute
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
rule allows and so maybe in that case
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
sponsoring that person to go further so
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you represent pedernal thank you
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Appleby for
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
I agree with mentoring I mean it can be
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
unbelievably helpful but I'm wondering
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
if a it's out of the scope of this law
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
and be whether or not that is something
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
that would be that we would prefer to
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
leave up to local control through the
 
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.339 align:start position:0%
superintendent or the principal to set
 
00:43:20.339 --> 00:43:21.589 align:start position:0%
superintendent or the principal to set
the

00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
um parameters for how they run their
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
schools thank you thank you for the
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
question as I've been told many times I
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
don't have that much of an opinion that
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
anyone cares about so
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
um I I what I will say and answer is I
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
think the mentoring issue from what we
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
have seen what I have seen is a much
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
larger issue than this
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit at the study
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
committee this past year about the
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
turnover of new teachers that 22 year
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
old who comes out of a program and they
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
put him in a classroom in September and
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
that you know we'll see in June and they
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't get support some districts I can
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
tell you Merrimack Valley School
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
District does a fantastic job with new
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
Educators they have a dedicated person
 
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's their only job but there are
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
other districts where it's pretty much
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
what I just said we'll see in June and
 
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
then we have high turnovers so I think
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
the mentoring piece is a larger and may
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
warrant some other
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
um other thoughts
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
so representative cascadden thank you is
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
it all right for me to address the
 
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.650 align:start position:0%
it all right for me to address the
mentor

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
mentor
 
00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.569 align:start position:0%
mentor
question

00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:33.530 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:35.660 align:start position:0%
so I have um
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
overseeing many of these plans because I
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
feel it's the role of the superintendent
 
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
to monitor those people not every
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
District does I've been to a district
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
where the secretary monitored it and I
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
took it over immediately
 
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:49.730 align:start position:0%
took it over immediately
um

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you from my training on
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
these anytime a person went on an
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
emergency waiver and then began a plan
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
the candidate was required to find a
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
mentor anywhere that was certified in
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
the field they were working on so I I
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
Mentor teachers in Littleton who are
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
getting certified as English speakers of
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
other languages because I'm certified in
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
that field and then you monitor I mean I
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
within the district you meet you should
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
meet with that candidate on an annual
 
00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
basis to see how they're progressing
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
through their plan and to provide
 
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
resources but yes they should be a
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
mentor that knows that
 
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
um there are also districts who have
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
titled two funds we had a very extensive
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
um mentoring program so that we paid
 
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
stipends to teachers who wanted to be
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
mentors to new teachers within the
 
00:45:42.839 --> 00:45:43.849 align:start position:0%
mentors to new teachers within the
district

00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:45:46.329 --> 00:45:46.339 align:start position:0%
and again it's not consistent I'm sure
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
but it's a valuable tool as
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
representative Heath said so mentoring
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
does occur and it should occur to those
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
candidates so thank you thank you
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
um I think mentoring maybe is a separate
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh subject to address
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
um uh I mean it's uh
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
Standalone role but um
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Mr Appleby I
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
see none just comment one closing
 
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:16.730 align:start position:0%
see none just comment one closing
comment

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
um chair lad just whispered in my ear
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
that there is a bill regarding mentoring
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you um
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
Brian Hawkins representing Nea New
 
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today I'll I'll uh keep my
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
comments fairly brief a lot of the
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
questions we had about this bill were
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
addressed uh specifically some of the
 
00:46:53.569 --> 00:46:53.579 align:start position:0%
questions that representative cascadden
 
00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
and Tanner are raised with respect to
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
you know we want to put people into the
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
classroom we don't want to just put a
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
warm body there we want to make sure
 
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
that that person is you know especially
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
if they're interested in it or as
 
00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:10.940 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible being put on a a a a
 
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
certification plan if that's if that's
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
what they want to do so uh so I guess my
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
point in raising that again is just that
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
we in looking at this that we're looking
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
at this as only one small piece of the
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
puzzle and not
 
00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:29.339 align:start position:0%
um you know something that is going to
 
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:31.940 align:start position:0%
be helpful in in
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
the long term which I think is Let's uh
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
strengthen the pipeline of educators we
 
00:47:40.569 --> 00:47:40.579 align:start position:0%
have coming into the profession
 
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
as Mr Appleby and representative Ladd
 
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know there are several
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
bills uh working their way through the
 
00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:50.099 align:start position:0%
legislature and Senate on that
 
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
specifically on
 
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:52.790 align:start position:0%
specifically on
um

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
mentoring there is a a bill that will
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully make its way over here having
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
to do with the state better supporting
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
mentoring programs for local school
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
districts I just wanted to also answer
 
00:48:10.329 --> 00:48:10.339 align:start position:0%
the the question regarding uh position
 
00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
positions in a in a collective uh you
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
know collective bargaining unit
 
00:48:19.569 --> 00:48:19.579 align:start position:0%
so I think the short answer would be yes
 
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:24.020 align:start position:0%
if uh if if there is a covered position
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
that that person with the emergency
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
certificate is filling then they would
 
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
be in the bargaining unit
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
um so something like math math teachers
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
are in the bargaining unit I'm feeling a
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
math teacher position not in the bargain
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
unit so
 
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.690 align:start position:0%
unit so
um

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh any questions
 
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative lead
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
I want to tack onto what Brian was just
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
saying but going a little bit farther
 
00:48:59.930 --> 00:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's responsibility in statute right now
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
where all certified people are evaluated
 
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
by Administration or by their supervisor
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
each year there's observations and
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation required now when you add
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
into that you know it the the people I
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
was uh evaluating and we I had to do so
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
many observations for every evaluation
 
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
and for a person that's in their first
 
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
year as three evaluations a year in my
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
district so that was our policy so that
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
holds up this uh nine observations that
 
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
are written down and communicated but
 
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
there's many you're in there every day
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
when I see somebody needing that help
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
immediately we start in with the
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring mentoring program and that's
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
written up as part of the observation
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
report the evaluation report and and I
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
hope we can tack on to what's going on
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
in the Senate right now because that
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
does result in needed funds to do that
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
one of the recommendations I went made
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
where it was that the person go back to
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
University main Farmington and take some
 
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
courses in language arts and if they
 
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to even you know continue the
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
year that they were in so I I think it's
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
incumbent Upon Our principles and maybe
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
it's the director of special education
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's doing the supervision of the you
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
know the uh the life skills teacher to
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're in that classroom
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
also unfortunately we lay down a lot of
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
paperwork for them and regulations and
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
it keeps them out of the class oh thank
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll close the hearing on
 
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
House Bill 654 and I think we are next
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
scheduled for executive session
 
00:50:40.569 --> 00:50:40.579 align:start position:0%
um was there some request for a break
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
yes so we will uh break for a caucus
 
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.339 --> 01:23:03.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:03.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
Yeah

01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
Yeah
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
well moving forward right here uh I'd
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
like to welcome everybody back we are
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
now the education committee is going to
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
go into executive session we have a

01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to discuss 155 along with
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
168 they're both overlap in terms of
 
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:43.500 align:start position:0%

Surety bonds

01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
155 does also do a couple of things in
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
terms of membership of the division of
 
01:26:00.729 --> 01:26:00.739 align:start position:0%
higher ed support in terms of
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
removing one member and
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
listing several others for the
 
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
possibility of designee in terms of the
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
surety bond we had discussion of of that
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
along with 168 which is a bill that I
 
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
had worked with
 
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
um Mr Appleby on and in further
 
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
discussions with that
 
01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:27.410 align:start position:0%
discussions with that
um

01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
he thought he actually liked the
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
language in 155 better than what we had
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
worked on in 168 in terms of uh the uh
 
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
10 percent of annual growth in the year
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
in which the of the current Academic
 
01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.110 align:start position:0%
in which the of the current Academic
Year

01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:51.260 align:start position:0%
um which is the language in 155.
 
01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.910 align:start position:0%
um which is the language in 155.
so

01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
um he he thought that was a better
 
01:26:58.729 --> 01:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
language actually
 
01:26:58.739 --> 01:26:59.330 align:start position:0%
language actually
um

01:26:59.330 --> 01:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where it came from but he
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
liked it better uh so
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
um you know our intention was to move a
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
155 and then I would
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
um i.tl my own bill 168.
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the second
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
none thank you for sure as rep Port
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
Ellie said this is a just a basic need
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
the department of vacation brought to us
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
to rather they prefer this bill over the
 
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
one they brought to us so
 
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
it was just get done
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
let's open up to uh further discussion
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
now from the committee members
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative miler uh thank you Mr
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
chair uh somebody answered the question
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
for me please why do we want to reduce
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
to 10 percent of the annual growth
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
what's the advantage of that
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
as we particularly look at trying to
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
protect students
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
in case something should happen
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh so why why do we want to do it why
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know who to direct that too but
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh if I might yes go ahead yeah
 
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
um I I think Mr Appleby had indicated
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
that he thought that that was a
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
reasonable based on the fact that there
 
01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
have only been foreclosures in 20 plus
 
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
years to his knowledge
 
01:28:28.450 --> 01:28:28.460 align:start position:0%
um and it would also help
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
new career schools uh get started
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
um without the overwhelming burden of a
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
higher surety bond and the charges for
 
01:28:40.139 --> 01:28:41.629 align:start position:0%
higher surety bond and the charges for
such

01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
such
 
01:28:41.639 --> 01:28:42.649 align:start position:0%
such
um

01:28:42.649 --> 01:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
but he felt that that was
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
adequate based on past history
 
01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.930 --> 01:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
Madam Clerk
 
01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
the motion is
 
01:29:04.689 --> 01:29:04.699 align:start position:0%

foreign

01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go you know we can just
 
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
leave it at
 
01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
um at the
 
01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
well there's no recommendation right now
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely no recommendation so that we
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
have left itl or retained
 
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.810 align:start position:0%
have left itl or retained
right

01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
and then events going to be ought to
 
01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
pass on the on the floor if it goes to
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
the whole unless unless routine
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's right oh
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
we have several options which we can do
 
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:07.010 align:start position:0%
we have several options which we can do
here

01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
um this is not an early bill
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
if we see there's some things which need
 
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
further work on it
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
you can retain one
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
and not take action on the second bill
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
here today which is very similar
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
and and because if you retain it it's
 
01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.790 align:start position:0%
and and because if you retain it it's
retained

01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
and we can work on it but we would work
 
01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
over on the up or the course of the
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
remainder of this year and then November
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
have to come up with a recommendation if
 
01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
I could suggest that we we move forward
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
and what happens with 155 happens with
 
01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:49.729 align:start position:0%
and what happens with 155 happens with
155.

01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's basically what we're talking
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
about right now if we don't we have two
 
01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
ways of moving forward with that bill
 
01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
well I thought I thought oh you said Mr
 
01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
chair was that um that we could retain
 
01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
155 and then not exact 168.
 
01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:08.290 align:start position:0%
155 and then not exact 168.
um

01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:08.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
that that would that would be the
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
process which if retain is the motion
 
01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
which we support right right then I
 
01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
would highly recommend that we keep you
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
know you know well then we could deal
 
01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
whatever we wanted to if you wanted to
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
act on it this year
 
01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:28.340 align:start position:0%
you know but prior to
 
01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
June right then you would have to have
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
something to do it with and that would
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
have to be done with one six 168 and
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
amend 168. and then 168 the way we want
 
01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:43.139 align:start position:0%
to do it if we we put down 168 and we
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
retain 155 we would then end up dealing
 
01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
with it in November but um and and so
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
there's that's one track we go or we can
 
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
just leave it at you know right now
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
um if if we're wanting to
 
01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:58.970 align:start position:0%
um if if we're wanting to
um

01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
get to the floor with you know no
 
01:33:01.679 --> 01:33:03.950 align:start position:0%
get to the floor with you know no
recommendation

01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.270 align:start position:0%
recommendation
um

01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
is that you know no recommendation it's
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
gonna be one report there the way it is
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
because there's no other you know
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's no idea if you want to go itl
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
then that would be a 10-10 then right
 
01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:23.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:28.100 align:start position:0%
a move to retain and then hold on 168
 
01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
and then move have more conversation
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
about both of these uh from a retained
 
01:33:33.719 --> 01:33:35.209 align:start position:0%
about both of these uh from a retained
sample

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
sample
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
okay we yeah so go ahead yeah
 
01:33:44.689 --> 01:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
in hoping we can get to a bipartisan uh
 
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
Solution on using 168.
 
01:33:52.370 --> 01:33:52.380 align:start position:0%

thank you very much so

thank you very much so
um

01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
based on our discussion I'm not even
 
01:35:18.649 --> 01:35:18.659 align:start position:0%
going to bring 168 up to the floor right
 
01:35:18.659 --> 01:35:19.850 align:start position:0%
going to bring 168 up to the floor right
now

01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so we will discuss that uh we have
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
until March 16th to make a decision on
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
that particular bill
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
so just put that down in your locker or
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
something we put off that would be about
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
the fifth of the sixth bill which I've
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
done Mr chair on on 168
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that I think this is a good
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
process on this and maybe we could have
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
that that's sure that that's you know
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
I'm open to that yeah you can even put
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
together if we need a subcommittee to
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
work with him maybe by you know tripping
 
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
over there to work with him here so I'd
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
like to do that I'll put together a
 
01:36:05.689 --> 01:36:05.699 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and that subcommittee can
 
01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
go try to hammer this thing out I think
 
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea thanks again thanks
 
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh the next bill which we have on
 
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
the on the docket if we go down that way
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
is 170 we do not have that amending
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
language back yet so I'm going to jump
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
you have some discussion not Amendment
 
01:36:35.209 --> 01:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
or not a motion
 
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
go ahead no
 
01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:38.030 align:start position:0%
go ahead no
um

01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have a subcommittee I
 
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
just want to offer could primex risk
 
01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:44.110 align:start position:0%
just want to offer could primex risk
management

01:36:44.110 --> 01:36:44.120 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
organization be a resource in that
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
discussion with Mr Appleby just
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know yeah just offering that out
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
there because that's their specialty the
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
the technical support we use on and
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
subcommittees managed much differently
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
than we do for a regular hearing or what
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
we're doing here a subcommittee we
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
oftentimes do engage in the intent is to
 
01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
get as much information as we can even
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
though they may not be a voting member
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
they're there for technical support and
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
they are really you know actively
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
involved in in the outcome so
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
um yes the answer is yes to that and and
 
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
any other you know organization agency
 
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
that has information that that
 
01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:30.659 align:start position:0%
subcommittee wants to chase after that
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
has to be approved by the subcommittee
 
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
to open up and invite them to the table
 
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
to work with them
 
01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:38.689 align:start position:0%
to work with them
right

01:37:38.689 --> 01:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to jump over this next
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
one right here
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
um this is uh 170 we don't have all the
 
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
information back from OLS uh supposed to
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
um Expediting it that we don't have it
 
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
so uh going down HB 626 requiring the
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to administer
 
01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
the educational Freedom account
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman I'd like to
 
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
make a motion for itl
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
is there a second second
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion on the table uh it
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
was made by represent Belcher itl for
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
this 626 and second by representative
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh discussion
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh yes just briefly on this bill we've
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh we've seen it brought that the idea
 
01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
that this would somehow reduce
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
um but we we don't have any idea if
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
that's true we don't know we didn't we
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
weren't provided with the actual cost
 
01:38:42.669 --> 01:38:42.679 align:start position:0%
outlook on this we know that the current
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
the current administration of the
 
01:38:47.090 --> 01:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
program is running within the mean of
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
Public School Systems as far as the
 
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for this and we
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
also know that there's going to be
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
further legislation coming to us shortly
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to provide clarification
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
that more than one organization can be
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh responsible for administering this
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
program and I believe there's also a bid
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
coming up on this before too long
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
I would uh second those considerations
 
01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I think that we've seen instances in
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
the past of issues where government
 
01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:24.380 align:start position:0%
agencies have run similar programs
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we want to get into the
 
01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
situation where a program like this
 
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
could be run
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
um uh efficiently by one Administration
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then a new Administration comes in
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
and does not look favorably on the
 
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
program and
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
um uh might put the program in Jeopardy
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's uh
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
um best left with uh
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship organizations or
 
01:40:00.729 --> 01:40:00.739 align:start position:0%
organizations that are
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
authorized by uh dra as per current law
 
01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative miler
 
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
well there are some known facts that we
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
have here
 
01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars which is ten
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
percent of basically what is given to
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
other this program
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
goes to the scholarship organization
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
and yet there's little oversight to that
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
so if you look at some of the uh cost
 
01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.090 align:start position:0%
so if you look at some of the uh cost
modules

01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
modules
 
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
from the Department which we've seen in
 
01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
this committee which is about a hundred
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
and sixty thousand dollars for a staffer
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
and I I have no idea how many staff the
 
01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:52.610 align:start position:0%
and I I have no idea how many staff the
uh

01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization has I
 
01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:56.870 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization has I
believe

01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
that it's about four staff including
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
executive director and three staff
 
01:41:00.719 --> 01:41:02.629 align:start position:0%
executive director and three staff
members

01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh We've not had any report from them as
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
it relates to
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
how many staff they have Etc but if you
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
take a hundred sixty thousand dollars
 
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
and times it by four or five percent
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about seven hundred
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars you throw in another
 
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
couple hundred thousand dollars for
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
hardware and software
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's under a million dollars
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
for the Department to manage the system
 
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
by having it in the department you have
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
greater legislative oversight we have
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
little legislative oversight right now
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
the greater legislative oversight these
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
are taxpayers monies that we're dealing
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
with here
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers monies that are going to a
 
01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
private entity that's run out of New
 
01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:45.950 align:start position:0%
private entity that's run out of New
York

01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
York
 
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
to run this program
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
I would just seem to me that if you want
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
to have funding for children
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
in this program
 
01:41:58.370 --> 01:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
you'd have another what eight nine eight
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars that could go out these
 
01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:02.149 align:start position:0%
million dollars that could go out these
children

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
rather than going to administer a not a
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
a for-profit Institution
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
that uh has done this program
 
01:42:14.209 --> 01:42:14.219 align:start position:0%
it just seen another state other state
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
entities that have similar programs
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
they're not as liberal as this one is
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
but other ones that have similar
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
programs are run by the Department of
 
01:42:22.139 --> 01:42:24.590 align:start position:0%
programs are run by the Department of
Education

01:42:24.590 --> 01:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
and so it only seemed logical to me that
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
if we want to have some legislative
 
01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.830 align:start position:0%
if we want to have some legislative
oversight

01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
the department is the place it should be
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
because we have a direct handle on them
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have direct handle
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
on this and I'm disappointed that uh
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
representatives from the from the
 
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
college scholarship organization aren't
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
here this is the second time we've dealt
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
with this issue
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
they haven't been here to basically
 
01:42:51.530 --> 01:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
provide background to this committee I
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
don't know why they're not here they've
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
been here before
 
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:57.290 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

01:42:57.290 --> 01:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:59.689 --> 01:42:59.699 align:start position:0%
I believe that this is the way that we
 
01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:03.659 align:start position:0%
should do it does not change the program
 
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
the funding is still there it's not
 
01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
repealing the program
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's basically trying to provide
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
management of millions of taxpayer
 
01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.050 align:start position:0%
management of millions of taxpayer
dollars

01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
that should be coming out of the
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
rather than a private entity
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
so I will definitely be voting against
 
01:43:25.850 --> 01:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
this IDL and then prepared to put an
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
ought to pass once this has passed once
 
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
this is voted on thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:31.820 align:start position:0%
represent cordial
 
01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to put out there since
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
I've done some research since the
 
01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.609 align:start position:0%
I've done some research since the
hearing

01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
um the main office of this organization
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
that currently runs the program is in
 
01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.229 align:start position:0%
that currently runs the program is in
Concord

01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
the organization does have 10 full-time
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
equivalent employees
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
01:43:52.679 --> 01:43:53.570 align:start position:0%
there's also
um

01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
it does operate within the parameters
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
actually less than 10 percent
 
01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:04.139 align:start position:0%
of administrative costs
 
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
and there is oversight
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
and accountability in that the
 
01:44:10.739 --> 01:44:11.330 align:start position:0%
and accountability in that the
um

01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Revenue must
 
01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:19.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
so another issue this is a question so
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
those were my just my comments just
 
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
sharing some information
 
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
that I have uh come across since this is
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
a very important issue to me and I think
 
01:44:36.649 --> 01:44:36.659 align:start position:0%
overall with these efas we need to
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
understand that you know these kids
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
aren't just dollar signs we need to keep
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
in mind what is best for the students
 
01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.570 align:start position:0%
in mind what is best for the students
um

01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:47.629 --> 01:44:47.639 align:start position:0%
where is this figure of 90 million
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
coming from because you you keep
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
mentioning that and so did
 
01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative luno I actually have in
 
01:44:56.689 --> 01:44:56.699 align:start position:0%
my notes from the hearing representative
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
luno referring to
 
01:44:59.100 --> 01:44:59.750 align:start position:0%
luno referring to
um

01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars the cost of running
 
01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:04.669 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars the cost of running
it

01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:45:07.729 --> 01:45:07.739 align:start position:0%
as he claimed nine million dollars for a
 
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
couple of people in an office those are
 
01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:11.270 align:start position:0%
couple of people in an office those are
um

01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
his direct words uh well it's it's more
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
like 10 people and the nine million
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
dollars is based on this figure of 90
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars where is the figure of
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
90 million coming from
 
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
so that is all for a discussion
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
01:45:31.729 --> 01:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you Mr
 
01:45:31.739 --> 01:45:32.810 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you Mr
chairman

01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
um first
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
um children's scholarship fund is a
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
non-profit or organization
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
um secondly
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
um in statute is the requirement for an
 
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
EA EFA oversight committee we met
 
01:45:49.570 --> 01:45:49.580 align:start position:0%
several times last year
 
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the chair a senator
 
01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:56.699 align:start position:0%
um left and we had no further meetings
 
01:45:58.209 --> 01:45:58.219 align:start position:0%
that year
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
appointees have been made by the house
 
01:46:04.450 --> 01:46:04.460 align:start position:0%
and now by the Senate we got an email
 
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
this morning about setting up a meeting
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the EFA oversight committee hopefully
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
within the next few weeks and it will be
 
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
chaired by Senator Ward chair of Senate
 
01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:19.189 align:start position:0%
chaired by Senator Ward chair of Senate
education

01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
for further discussion represent
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
woodcock okay chairman lad um I just
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
want to uh respond to or follow up on
 
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
confused when we have a special ed
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
Department that spends millions and
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
millions of millions of dollars to
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
ministered by the state of New Hampshire
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
doe we have a food and nutrition
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
Department to spends millions and
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
millions of millions of dollars is
 
01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
oversight and regulated administrated by
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education there was
 
01:46:54.169 --> 01:46:54.179 align:start position:0%
certification and a licensure we have
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
Adult Ed and the programs go on and on
 
01:46:59.290 --> 01:46:59.300 align:start position:0%
all these programs spend tax fail money
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
efficiently uh for the most part and are
 
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
organized Enron and administer through
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education so I
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
understand why this one particular
 
01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
facet This One Singular program of all
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
the programs we do will go to somebody
 
01:47:15.719 --> 01:47:16.609 align:start position:0%
the programs we do will go to somebody
else

01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
clearly we have a Department of
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
Education that often is very uh
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
efficient and successful in mentioning
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
these types of things
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
I mean they created it they know what it
 
01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
is and they have models in every other
 
01:47:29.219 --> 01:47:30.050 align:start position:0%
is and they have models in every other
state

01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand why we think we
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
can do this as a Lone Ranger and expend
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
the nine million or times 90 is actually
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
times 10 years of the fact that out but
 
01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is whatever it is we
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
know it's way over a million bucks a
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
year well
 
01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
so it just makes no sense why I wouldn't
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
trust them to do this as well thank you
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair further discussion
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.609 --> 01:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so
 
01:47:58.370 --> 01:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
I agree with uh with I think the the
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that representative Woodcock
 
01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
just uh just laid out why is this
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
program any different you know it's
 
01:48:05.689 --> 01:48:05.699 align:start position:0%
spending taxpayer and money it's
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
involving um well in this case
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
um you know 3 200 students as opposed to
 
01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:14.219 align:start position:0%
the 165 000 students that that the
 
01:48:15.649 --> 01:48:15.659 align:start position:0%
department already
 
01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
um you know works with across the uh the
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so why
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the department be able to
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
um uh to do this certainly um at a more
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost than 10 percent of the
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
program budget
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
um uh so I I mean what's so what's so
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
special about this program you know I
 
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
thought representative Miler also
 
01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
brought up um a really good point when
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
he talked about how liberal this program
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
is is it it is I mean it's like swiss
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
cheese and compared to compared to
 
01:48:49.129 --> 01:48:49.139 align:start position:0%
um other voucher programs that are
 
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
seeing uh you know that that that that
 
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
are in other states and um and
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli well actually I
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
I had a constituent reach out to me when
 
01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
all this was going down a couple years
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
ago and said hey you know there's
 
01:49:05.689 --> 01:49:05.699 align:start position:0%
nothing conservative about this uh EFA
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
Pro about this program
 
01:49:10.129 --> 01:49:10.139 align:start position:0%
um so uh so I think representative Miler
 
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:12.659 align:start position:0%
characterized it um quite well and then
 
01:49:14.209 --> 01:49:14.219 align:start position:0%
finally I think to representative
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
cordelli's uh point is that oh you know
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
unlike other programs what if a
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
different Administration comes into the
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
doe and puts this program in Jeopardy
 
01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
well it's exactly the lack of
 
01:49:29.689 --> 01:49:29.699 align:start position:0%
accountability lack of transparency and
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
lack of oversight of the EFA program
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
that put this program in Jeopardy and by
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
having the Department of Education
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
administer this program at least we'll
 
01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
see some improvement in these areas
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
I think this program is a lot more
 
01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
similar to the tax credit scholarship
 
01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:52.189 align:start position:0%
similar to the tax credit scholarship
program

01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:49:56.050 --> 01:49:56.060 align:start position:0%
um than any other program that um uh is
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
controlled by the Department of
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
Education and the tax credit scholarship
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
program is uh something like 11 12 years
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
old in statute is a 10 percent
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
administrative cost for that program no
 
01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
different than this
 
01:50:17.209 --> 01:50:17.219 align:start position:0%
um uh in terms of the EFA program being
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
in Jeopardy
 
01:50:21.169 --> 01:50:21.179 align:start position:0%
um I would
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
um disagree with that uh vigorously and
 
01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
that uh I think the EFA program is
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
extremely successful they're providing
 
01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
education options
 
01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
um to over 3 000 children and I would
 
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
just say in terms of taxpayer money
 
01:50:43.609 --> 01:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
those families are getting some of their
 
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
tax dollars back actually to educate
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
their own children
 
01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tanner
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to point out
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
that the education tax credit is not
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money like the education
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts are that's number one
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:02.810 align:start position:0%
number two
um

01:51:02.810 --> 01:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:05.090 --> 01:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher spoke about
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
um then in other bills coming that's
 
01:51:09.410 --> 01:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
going to open up more vendors for this
 
01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
program which to me means that you need
 
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
more oversight because if you look at
 
01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
this particular bill that outlines what
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
the scholarship committee organization
 
01:51:23.689 --> 01:51:23.699 align:start position:0%
does right now it's seven pages of
 
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
requirements of setting up surveys of
 
01:51:31.689 --> 01:51:31.699 align:start position:0%
overseeing monies of setting up
 
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
programs it it's very involved what this
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization already does
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
so if we have more vendors
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
um you know we're going to need more
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
oversight to make sure that the other
 
01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:47.330 align:start position:0%
oversight to make sure that the other
vendors

01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
01:51:49.609 --> 01:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
follow the program that's that's
 
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
subscribed in these seven pages that
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
you'll find in the bill
 
01:51:53.159 --> 01:51:54.530 align:start position:0%
you'll find in the bill
so

01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:55.129 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:51:55.129 --> 01:51:55.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's a good reason
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of good reasons taxpayer money
 
01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:03.659 align:start position:0%
not not tax credits
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that the fact that if we are going
 
01:52:08.050 --> 01:52:08.060 align:start position:0%
to open it up to more vendors
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
we need to have a central place
 
01:52:14.330 --> 01:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
where there's oversight and central
 
01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
place where there's
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
um some guidance on setting up all these
 
01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
different requirements for this program
 
01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much I do have
 
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
a question and and by the way I'm really
 
01:52:28.850 --> 01:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear that the tax credit
 
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
is uh not taxpayer money that's
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
encouraging that means we're really uh
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're learning right
 
01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
um so uh going on I'd like to ask the
 
01:52:42.530 --> 01:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
question and maybe somebody can help me
 
01:52:46.609 --> 01:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
out uh the scholarship organization is
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
responsible for administering this
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
program what kind of dollars have had
 
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
they have they had to put into the
 
01:52:58.270 --> 01:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
program in terms of application
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
yeah software to manage uh and so if we
 
01:53:07.129 --> 01:53:07.139 align:start position:0%
take out that cost in the future what
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
might we see in terms of how much is
 
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
needed to manage this program
 
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli um thank you we can
 
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
look to Arizona the first education
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship excuse me education savings
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
account program in 2011 where they
 
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
started out with a manual system and
 
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
we've talked in years past about the uh
 
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
the audits down there that found
 
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
waste and fraud because of the manual
 
01:53:41.689 --> 01:53:41.699 align:start position:0%
system that could not keep up with the
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
demand and verifying expenses they are
 
01:53:47.890 --> 01:53:47.900 align:start position:0%
they moved
 
01:53:51.070 --> 01:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
to an electronic system
 
01:53:53.649 --> 01:53:53.659 align:start position:0%
called class wallet
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
that is the same system that children's
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund contracted with at the
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
but it's a very successful program that
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
is being used around around the country
 
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
and they are actually working with
 
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund all the time
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
to develop additional reports detail
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
reports Etc I talked to the vice
 
01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.870 align:start position:0%
reports Etc I talked to the vice
president

01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
president
 
01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of months ago about
 
01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:23.410 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of months ago about
that

01:54:23.410 --> 01:54:23.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
so there are extreme startup costs and
 
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
in terms of startup I know for a fact
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
that other
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh programs that are in the works around
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
the country
 
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
um could not believe that New Hampshire
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
got the system passed
 
01:54:47.689 --> 01:54:47.699 align:start position:0%
into law in June and was enrolling
 
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
systems in September West Virginia
 
01:54:54.010 --> 01:54:54.020 align:start position:0%
um took over a year
 
01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
other states you know aren't even
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
attempting what we did successfully here
 
01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I think it's um
 
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
thanks to a combined effort of the
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education working with the
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund to make that
 
01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:09.970 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund to make that
happen

01:55:09.970 --> 01:55:09.980 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:55:13.570 --> 01:55:13.580 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that
 
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
without that
 
01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:17.890 align:start position:0%
without that
partnership

01:55:17.890 --> 01:55:17.900 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
that could have been accomplished no
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
other state is even attempting something
 
01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so could you do you have any
 
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
idea then representative cordelli as far
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
as the startup costs for class wallet uh
 
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
sure I'm sure that to have that program
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's going to be maintenance and
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
annual costs for the program what will
 
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
they be as extensive as they were when
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
we started up
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
um I I believe they uh they will not be
 
01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
and I think the point has been made
 
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
previously that
 
01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
um that will help reduce administrative
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
costs and every dollar that is reduced
 
01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
in terms of the administrative costs
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
will be more money to go to children
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a significant point
 
01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
that we should not lose sight of thank
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
you further further discussion yes
 
01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative Myler uh this is director
 
01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
that uh representative cordelli since
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
he's got more inside information than
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
the most of us do that because of the
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
startup costs are no longer there do you
 
01:56:26.209 --> 01:56:26.219 align:start position:0%
anticipate the uh scholarship or the
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
Children's Fund reducing their 10
 
01:56:31.129 --> 01:56:31.139 align:start position:0%
request for their management of the
 
01:56:31.139 --> 01:56:33.290 align:start position:0%
request for their management of the
program

01:56:33.290 --> 01:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:56:35.570 --> 01:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh I would anticipate that
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are going down
 
01:56:40.729 --> 01:56:40.739 align:start position:0%
um I think it was actually 9.8 in the
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
first year from my discussions with them
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the exact figures to the
 
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
cost of class wallet on an ongoing basis
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
um but we can attempt to get those
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
and it was it was my understanding that
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
when we put the RFP initially out there
 
01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:03.659 align:start position:0%
was one applicant for this job and
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's the scholarship organization
 
01:57:07.609 --> 01:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
which we have if in fact we go out for
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
rfps uh which uh you know we most likely
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
will be occurring
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
do you expect that the you know being a
 
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
market a competitive market that we
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
might get some responses could do it
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
cheaper than what we're doing right now
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's entirely possible and um if we
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
can uh do it cheaper and uh um mall for
 
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh competition competition is uh
 
01:57:37.490 --> 01:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
wonderful it helps in uh very many
 
01:57:40.270 --> 01:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
markets including education
 
01:57:43.129 --> 01:57:43.139 align:start position:0%
Tanner uh that was uh there was no
 
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
original RFP for the scholarship
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
organization when the when the tax
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
credits were put into place and at that
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
time there were two organizations the
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
giving and going Alliance which is a
 
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.290 align:start position:0%
giving and going Alliance which is a
Christian

01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
Christian
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
um Christian School uh scholarship
 
01:58:00.109 --> 01:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
organization that that filtered into
 
01:58:00.119 --> 01:58:00.950 align:start position:0%
organization that that filtered into
that

01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
um so this this organization is based in
 
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
New York City it has several other
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
places that it it provides service so
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
they get a cut of the money I would
 
01:58:13.970 --> 01:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
imagine that that is taken for
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
administration too because they offer
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
support services and advertising
 
01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
services to the local scholarship
 
01:58:20.099 --> 01:58:22.250 align:start position:0%
services to the local scholarship
organization

01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:58:26.109 --> 01:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's an educational
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
thing and in other places the Department
 
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
of Education hires vendors to do
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
different things but then oversees those
 
01:58:38.330 --> 01:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
vendors and the grants
 
01:58:41.450 --> 01:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
um why not this I mean it's just this is
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
the same as the other one
 
01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
um as all the other things that the
 
01:58:48.410 --> 01:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
department of education does and
 
01:58:50.450 --> 01:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
um they're the they're the organization
 
01:58:53.689 --> 01:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayers think
 
01:58:56.330 --> 01:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
are running things and that that
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers want accountability and fiscal
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the money that
 
01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
they're paying to the state
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
um the money they're paying locally and
 
01:59:09.530 --> 01:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
and I think the best accountability and
 
01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility comes with the
 
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
state organs the State Department of
 
01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:16.010 align:start position:0%
state organs the State Department of
Education

01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
Education
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure this the Department of
 
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
Education will be pleased with your
 
01:59:20.340 --> 01:59:21.530 align:start position:0%
Education will be pleased with your
remarks

01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
remarks
 
01:59:23.209 --> 01:59:23.219 align:start position:0%
are there further comments from the
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative cordial did you
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
have your hand up or yeah I I think you
 
01:59:31.010 --> 01:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
did first though representative
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm not really on this committee so
 
01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
um you know that I worked at the
 
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
department of Ed and the department of
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
Ed is um charged with
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
um the flow of millions and millions of
 
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
dollars from the federal government as
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
well as adequacy
 
01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
my real concern is the audit
 
01:59:58.129 --> 01:59:58.139 align:start position:0%
possibilities in terms of how these
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
funds are being spent and the ability to
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
audit accurately
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
um these are taxpayer Monies
 
02:00:10.729 --> 02:00:10.739 align:start position:0%
following them is a difficult task at
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
best in the manner in which they're
 
02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
going out right now
 
02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:18.179 align:start position:0%
um we our adequacies dollars go out via
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
um that's the way it's been going these
 
02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
dollars are part of those dollars and I
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
believe that they should belong within
 
02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed for district for
 
02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
distribution I think it's just it's
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
cleaner it's neater I think we're
 
02:00:38.089 --> 02:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
opening up ourselves for all kinds of
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
fraud possibilities and problems
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
um just we want to keep things I think
 
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
as legislators it's our responsibility
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
to do the best job we can to keep things
 
02:00:53.689 --> 02:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
clean and accurate and audit proof so
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
I'd like people to consider the
 
02:00:59.209 --> 02:00:59.219 align:start position:0%
placement of the distribution at the
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
department of Ed because that's really
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
where it belongs and I think it would be
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
served most effectively that way thank
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
represent cordial I just want to
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
re-emphasize I think I mentioned it but
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
every year the uh
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
the organization that runs this needs to
 
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
reapply to the New Hampshire uh
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
division of Revenue and registration
 
02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
that yeah the dra
 
02:01:28.609 --> 02:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
um and so if they weren't running this
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
effectively they would not be reapproved
 
02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:33.530 align:start position:0%
effectively they would not be reapproved
um

02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:36.050 --> 02:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
just to also point out there was an
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
independent audit done by Grant Thornton
 
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
with all these figures that's one of the
 
02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:43.139 align:start position:0%
things I found it's posted on the
 
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
publicly on their website to um kind of
 
02:01:49.729 --> 02:01:49.739 align:start position:0%
uh give some transparency to all these
 
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
numbers so that's what I kind of based
 
02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
all my my research on so
 
02:01:57.649 --> 02:01:57.659 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion yes
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden
 
02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
um I just
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
is the children's scholarship fund what
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
that's my first question cordelli yeah
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
they administer the program yes so
 
02:02:18.649 --> 02:02:18.659 align:start position:0%
legislature does have oversight yes okay
 
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
so my question well not so much a
 
02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
question is just wondering
 
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship fund
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
guidelines are posted on the department
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
of Ed website which includes a record of
 
02:02:32.209 --> 02:02:32.219 align:start position:0%
educational attainment and then they
 
02:02:34.850 --> 02:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
recommend it the EFA Law requires all
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
students renewing a grant must provide a
 
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
record of educational attainment does
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
that mean the New Hampshire law or their
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
law in general because it doesn't
 
02:02:46.330 --> 02:02:46.340 align:start position:0%
specify Statewide but it's on our
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
website and it it gives three options
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
for a recipient of an EFA to be able to
 
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
provide educational attainment
 
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
I would think that that
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
information would be part of the fact
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
sheet because the primary goal here for
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
this money is for student growth in
 
02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
academic skills
 
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
class wallet if you go on and take a
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
look at it is a software system where
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
families can put in their expense
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's at BJ's Costco's Dollar
 
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
Tree ballet school and music school
 
02:03:26.089 --> 02:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
because these are all approved EFA
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
and then it comes off the scholarship so
 
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
it's like a
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
you know like a budget item
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
um but there's no record of student
 
02:03:39.719 --> 02:03:40.970 align:start position:0%
um but there's no record of student
progress

02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
progress
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
and our students who are receiving efas
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
also being screened for dyslexia because
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's still on my my brain but
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
I just questioned that
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
they deserve
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
all the same services for sure
 
02:04:00.050 --> 02:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
um but yet the same information needs to
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
be provided for that accountability
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
piece represent cordelli thank you I
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:07.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
well Tom is sole famous author once said
 
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
um the basic question is not what is
 
02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
best but who says what is best
 
02:04:20.689 --> 02:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
and I think that that is uh firmly
 
02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
um in the hands of parents
 
02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
um uh and that's what this program is
 
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
geared for unlike other programs
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
um the parents make decisions on the
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
educational needs of their child
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's not left to an administrator
 
02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
in education somewhere it's left to the
 
02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:49.390 align:start position:0%
in education somewhere it's left to the
parents

02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:04:56.350 --> 02:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
administrators staff within teachers
 
02:05:03.770 --> 02:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
within teachers within schools have sent
 
02:05:07.970 --> 02:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
their children to Charter Schools Etc or
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
even homeschool them because they
 
02:05:12.169 --> 02:05:12.179 align:start position:0%
thought that is what was best for their
 
02:05:12.179 --> 02:05:13.850 align:start position:0%
thought that is what was best for their
child

02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:05:16.129 --> 02:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
um and just let me point out one
 
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
additional option that is available to
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account of families
 
02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
they can actually send their child to a
 
02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's allowed under law they can send
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
their child to an out of District
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
public school you know we have we have
 
02:05:36.649 --> 02:05:36.659 align:start position:0%
districts you know we we rope them in
 
02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
and if your ZIP code is such and such
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
this is where you go to school unless
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
you have the means to send them
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and we're providing those
 
02:05:45.649 --> 02:05:45.659 align:start position:0%
families the means to send them
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and that could be a better
 
02:05:49.850 --> 02:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:51.169 align:start position:0%
public school
um

02:05:51.169 --> 02:05:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
um there's a book called redlining
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
that shows
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
um Bank redlining in certain
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods Chicago Los Angeles and
 
02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting to look at the
 
02:06:09.169 --> 02:06:09.179 align:start position:0%
overlay of the redlining for banking
 
02:06:11.689 --> 02:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
institutions with school districts I've
 
02:06:12.890 --> 02:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
seen it
 
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
um in addition
 
02:06:17.089 --> 02:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
um the story of the author I think it
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
was his brother in Chicago
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
um was looking to buy a house and move
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
his family to Chicago and this road
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
called North Avenue
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
they looked they found a beautiful house
 
02:06:31.370 --> 02:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
they fell in love with south of North
 
02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:32.589 align:start position:0%
they fell in love with south of North
Avenue

02:06:32.589 --> 02:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
Avenue
 
02:06:35.209 --> 02:06:35.219 align:start position:0%
but then they discovered they looked at
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
the proficiency rates of the school and
 
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
they were horrified and on the other
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
side of North Avenue the school was
 
02:06:42.649 --> 02:06:42.659 align:start position:0%
doing great
 
02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
so they moved to the other side of the
 
02:06:46.729 --> 02:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
north North Avenue but as they say in
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
the book they had to pay an extra 250
 
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
000 for a house they didn't like as well
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
in order to get a better free and
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate education for their child it
 
02:07:03.169 --> 02:07:03.179 align:start position:0%
cost them an extra 250 000 dollars
 
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
the discussion represent Balboni
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes my question is involved uh it's kind
 
02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
of uh basically you mentioned that
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
there's an oversight committee because
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
one of the things we're talking about is
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
accountability but
 
02:07:20.810 --> 02:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
um the program started two years ago
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
correct and um how many oversight
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
meetings have there been and
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
um what are you looking for when you
 
02:07:32.089 --> 02:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
have these meetings what kind of
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that you we also have
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
to look at just beyond we have oversight
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
committees too for regular public
 
02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
education Improvement and assessment
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
and the oversight committee which is
 
02:07:56.089 --> 02:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
responsible for overseeing this
 
02:07:59.089 --> 02:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
particular program has is has that
 
02:08:01.970 --> 02:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that obviously
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
that the program has written in statute
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
is followed and all components of
 
02:08:09.169 --> 02:08:09.179 align:start position:0%
including the component which you know
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
where they're we're tracking growth of a
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
children achievement to students it's
 
02:08:15.890 --> 02:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
written right in where you can take you
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
know an assessment test that's Norm
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
referenced National
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
test or you can take the Statewide
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
assessment that data is available and we
 
02:08:26.209 --> 02:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
do know in the regular High School
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
situations and and k through eight we
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
have situations where there are schools
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
which are not at that proficient Mark we
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
have a lot of them in certain uh course
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
areas and we want to see growth and
 
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
Improvement there the same thing would
 
02:08:43.550 --> 02:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
occur in in this program right here uh
 
02:08:46.850 --> 02:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
but I where I'm really concerned is that
 
02:08:49.850 --> 02:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
there are a number of programs which are
 
02:08:52.490 --> 02:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
in place in the EFA program as there are
 
02:08:55.010 --> 02:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
in charter schools where the the
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
programs have students coming from the
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
have real special unique needs and that
 
02:09:03.709 --> 02:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
we have to measure growth and
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
achievement of a student many different
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
ways and and I I've always spoken up and
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
said I'm not really locked into an
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
assessment test of some kind Vietnam
 
02:09:15.649 --> 02:09:15.659 align:start position:0%
reference to what there's so many ways
 
02:09:15.659 --> 02:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
reference to what there's so many ways
to

02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.350 align:start position:0%
to
what

02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
will calculate growth and that one of
 
02:09:22.729 --> 02:09:22.739 align:start position:0%
them is representing Cornelius looked at
 
02:09:24.770 --> 02:09:24.780 align:start position:0%
is through the parents and through
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
observing what that child is now able to
 
02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
do and looking at how that child now
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
reacts emotionally and socially with
 
02:09:36.050 --> 02:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
their peers and with others and so I I
 
02:09:38.089 --> 02:09:38.099 align:start position:0%
think that just as there's a regular
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
school system
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
and in the EFA program or the charter
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
school system there are a number of ways
 
02:09:48.410 --> 02:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
of doing that and I think the primary
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm hearing here is that
 
02:09:52.370 --> 02:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
there's dollars being spent and and
 
02:09:54.169 --> 02:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
we're taking it away from public
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
education and that that's that you know
 
02:09:59.930 --> 02:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
is a very Divergent way of thinking that
 
02:10:03.410 --> 02:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
I I have on this so that's my two cents
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
and I got a phone ringing here I owe
 
02:10:08.930 --> 02:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
everybody lunch or it's not yours
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.089 --> 02:10:17.099 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh question or if there's
 
02:10:19.850 --> 02:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
representative Allison uh I just want to
 
02:10:21.229 --> 02:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
follow up on a comment that
 
02:10:23.689 --> 02:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden made around
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
Seth's books uh and
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm frankly I I don't know but you you
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
referenced a record three assessment
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
three possible assessments that were
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
required under the EFA act yeah one is
 
02:10:42.649 --> 02:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
portfolio Okay it well then my question
 
02:10:44.450 --> 02:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
to you when it may be to representative
 
02:10:47.689 --> 02:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
cordelli as well are those assessed are
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
those assessments being given
 
02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
two students and two what are the
 
02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
results of those assessments on students
 
02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:56.030 align:start position:0%
results of those assessments on students
right

02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of what they are so there
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
are two questions I guess one are the
 
02:11:02.209 --> 02:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
assessments required with a variety of
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
possibilities and the second part of the
 
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
question is are the results of the
 
02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
anybody want to respond to that there
 
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
are three
 
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
forms of assessment that are provided
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
for in the uh statute the Statewide
 
02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
assessment and Norm reference assessment
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
or the portfolio which is the same
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
language that's in the homeschooling law
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and some of these families
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
um uh might be homeschooling
 
02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
um and using an EFA account for uh
 
02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
online courses
 
02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
um for curriculum uh for a whole host of
 
02:11:42.119 --> 02:11:42.950 align:start position:0%
um for curriculum uh for a whole host of
other

02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:44.330 align:start position:0%
other
um reasons

02:11:44.330 --> 02:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
um reasons
 
02:11:46.729 --> 02:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
um so that's entirely appropriate in my
 
02:11:49.729 --> 02:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
mind as a third alternative for an EFA
 
02:11:49.739 --> 02:11:50.629 align:start position:0%
mind as a third alternative for an EFA
family

02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.099 align:start position:0%
those Assessments in that process is on
 
02:11:55.689 --> 02:11:55.699 align:start position:0%
page two of this bill
 
02:11:57.770 --> 02:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair there's a
 
02:12:02.930 --> 02:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
lot to unpack in in those those last
 
02:12:04.609 --> 02:12:04.619 align:start position:0%
comments you know first of all other
 
02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
than through the voucher program
 
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
taxpayers aren't paying for
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers but um but you know I I
 
02:12:14.890 --> 02:12:14.900 align:start position:0%
think taxpayers can
 
02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:16.729 align:start position:0%
think taxpayers can
taxpayers

02:12:16.729 --> 02:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:12:20.209 --> 02:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
have oversight and transparency behind
 
02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
their Public Schools through through
 
02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
what are also called school boards in
 
02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
addition to legislative oversight every
 
02:12:29.209 --> 02:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
public school district has a school
 
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
board and school boards I think by
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
Statute have to meet at least once every
 
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
couple months and I think most me twice
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
a month at least our school board did
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
and while I was chair of the school
 
02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:46.270 align:start position:0%
and while I was chair of the school
board

02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
we reviewed
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
the district manifests so we knew
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
exactly what uh what money and how much
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
money how much taxpayer money was spent
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
on um on wide items and and uh and you
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
know through that I think
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
through that level of of oversight both
 
02:13:06.649 --> 02:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
at the local and the and the state level
 
02:13:06.659 --> 02:13:08.750 align:start position:0%
at the local and the and the state level
taxpayers

02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:10.390 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
have

02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
transparency and can make sure that
 
02:13:15.649 --> 02:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
their elected officials are accountable
 
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
but you know with the information that
 
02:13:20.450 --> 02:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
that that at least this committee and
 
02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
whether the oversight committee which I
 
02:13:24.649 --> 02:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
don't think has met for
 
02:13:27.530 --> 02:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
probably more than two months unlike
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
you you you see
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars being
 
02:13:38.589 --> 02:13:38.599 align:start position:0%
spent through vendors like Amazon
 
02:13:43.370 --> 02:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
Staples Best Buy BJs gun stock Mountain
 
02:13:45.530 --> 02:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
Dick's Sporting Goods and we don't know
 
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
what the mummy's being spent for and
 
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
spent on and um and and you know I think
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
I think the public deserves to know I
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
think it would make sense for the
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that already
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
handles up more than a billion dollars
 
02:14:06.050 --> 02:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
of public money to be able to taxpayer
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
money to be able to manage this program
 
02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:12.020 align:start position:0%
and provide the level of transparency
 
02:14:15.729 --> 02:14:15.739 align:start position:0%
that uh that I think the the public
 
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
taxpayers deserve
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent Cordell thank you I
 
02:14:23.330 --> 02:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
just mentioned it in addition to class
 
02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:24.470 align:start position:0%

02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
um I I remember the story I believe we
 
02:14:39.169 --> 02:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
heard it last year
 
02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
um of
 
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:46.010 --> 02:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
um request for reimbursement being
 
02:14:48.649 --> 02:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
denied because they looked up the book
 
02:14:51.890 --> 02:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
the student with the EFA was in the
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
fourth grade and this was not a book
 
02:14:56.569 --> 02:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a fourth grader it was
 
02:14:59.689 --> 02:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
for a high school kid so they denied the
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the book so that kind
 
02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:04.450 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the book so that kind
of

02:15:04.450 --> 02:15:04.460 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
accountability is being performed by the
 
02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund and that's
 
02:15:14.930 --> 02:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
part of where the costs come in because
 
02:15:18.589 --> 02:15:18.599 align:start position:0%
um every item is detailed and verified
 
02:15:21.530 --> 02:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
that it's appropriate I know that they
 
02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:22.450 align:start position:0%
that it's appropriate I know that they
have

02:15:22.450 --> 02:15:22.460 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:15:25.790 --> 02:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
denied certain certain expenses because
 
02:15:28.970 --> 02:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
it would be used by other children in
 
02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
the family as well as the children and
 
02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
the child with with the EFA so there is
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of accountability and I I
 
02:15:44.450 --> 02:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
think that that's um which maybe drives
 
02:15:47.629 --> 02:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
some of the expense but also drives the
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
verification that all these expenses are
 
02:15:53.629 --> 02:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
truly legitimate expenses for the child
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
who is the um receiving the EFA
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Myler thank
 
02:16:03.709 --> 02:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr lead not not to prolong this
 
02:16:07.609 --> 02:16:07.619 align:start position:0%
conversation because obviously uh those
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
of us on the respective sides of are
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
passionate about this this program is in
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
the state there's no question about that
 
02:16:16.609 --> 02:16:16.619 align:start position:0%
and I think all this bill is trying to
 
02:16:19.550 --> 02:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
do is to provide some greater oversight
 
02:16:22.569 --> 02:16:22.579 align:start position:0%
to the program and greater transparency
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
represent Balboni asked the question of
 
02:16:27.649 --> 02:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
how many times has the oversight
 
02:16:29.330 --> 02:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
committee met and I believe it's met
 
02:16:33.410 --> 02:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
once uh and I understand the issue of
 
02:16:35.929 --> 02:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
the change of leadership uh in the
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
Senate around that but it would seem to
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
me that if this was a priority of the
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
leadership and the governor's office
 
02:16:45.169 --> 02:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
that they would move because of the
 
02:16:47.089 --> 02:16:47.099 align:start position:0%
controversy of it that they would have
 
02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
moved to replace that chair and have
 
02:16:53.330 --> 02:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
more regular meetings on this the other
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
issue that has not been mentioned yet is
 
02:16:57.610 --> 02:16:57.620 align:start position:0%
that we've heard before this committee
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
the management of funds from the depart
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
from the federal government Etc is
 
02:17:06.650 --> 02:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
between four and a half and five percent
 
02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
not ten percent
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
and so I I just we just believe that 10
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
is an extraordinary amount of money and
 
02:17:16.250 --> 02:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
if you want money going to these to the
 
02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
program that children can benefit from
 
02:17:22.129 --> 02:17:22.139 align:start position:0%
we would try to we would try to uh
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
emphasize a fact and then let's make as
 
02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
much money available as possible rather
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
than in the management of the system and
 
02:17:31.490 --> 02:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
I think that our our position is is that
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
by having it in the department it can be
 
02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
managed just as as others have said in
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
an efficient way based upon the billions
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
of dollars that go out of that
 
02:17:42.589 --> 02:17:42.599 align:start position:0%
department anyway so the issue of
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
mismanagement of the of the department
 
02:17:47.450 --> 02:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
that has not been mentioned it is not
 
02:17:50.209 --> 02:17:50.219 align:start position:0%
there they can do this system and it
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
provides a direct contact to this
 
02:17:55.849 --> 02:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
by having it in an independent
 
02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
organization you don't have that same
 
02:18:04.429 --> 02:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
same kind of oversight so I would
 
02:18:05.929 --> 02:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
encourage people to recount of rethink
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
their position I know this is an
 
02:18:10.429 --> 02:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
important issue for all of us regardless
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
of what our position is and I I would
 
02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
recommend Mr chair that we move to vote
 
02:18:16.429 --> 02:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:18:20.530 --> 02:18:20.540 align:start position:0%
I would also support that recommendation
 
02:18:23.389 --> 02:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion on the table right
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
now to uh itl the bill and we're on 6
 
02:18:32.089 --> 02:18:32.099 align:start position:0%

okay so
 
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
um we're closing on lunch but I noticed
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
that we have safety here and I don't
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
want to keep our law enforcement sitting
 
02:21:17.770 --> 02:21:17.780 align:start position:0%
in our room all day
 
02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
so we're going to forego our lunch right
 
02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
now at this particular point in time and
 
02:21:27.770 --> 02:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
we're going to go on to uh HB 267
 
02:21:29.809 --> 02:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh this is a bill that's relative to
 
02:21:31.490 --> 02:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
criminal records checks and school
 
02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:34.070 align:start position:0%

um I'm going to open it up a little bit
 
02:21:38.929 --> 02:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
of a discussion here first
 
02:21:38.939 --> 02:21:39.849 align:start position:0%
of a discussion here first
um

02:21:39.849 --> 02:21:39.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
so that we can and I won't take any
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
motions during this discussion but it's
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%

me earlier just before and saying we'd
 
02:21:54.410 --> 02:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
like to go this route
 
02:21:57.050 --> 02:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
um do you would you like to lead off
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
with some
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
um questions or well I think uh take
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
some more information all right thank
 
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I think our concern is and
 
02:22:07.570 --> 02:22:07.580 align:start position:0%
this this bill
 
02:22:10.429 --> 02:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh provides an opportunity for school
 
02:22:14.809 --> 02:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
districts to do multiple uh background
 
02:22:17.210 --> 02:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
checks and I think we had some concern
 
02:22:21.170 --> 02:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
about why that needs to be done it also
 
02:22:24.050 --> 02:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
it also designates groups
 
02:22:26.210 --> 02:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
that could be done and we had some
 
02:22:28.730 --> 02:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
concerns about the cult the quote groups
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
and whether or not that might be
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
somewhat discriminatory from a
 
02:22:35.330 --> 02:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
standpoint of how this might be
 
02:22:38.590 --> 02:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
implemented now we recognize that
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
that this is subject to a collective
 
02:22:43.610 --> 02:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
bargain agreement and would have to be
 
02:22:47.090 --> 02:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
negotiated but we just we just don't
 
02:22:49.610 --> 02:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
understand there was testimony before
 
02:22:52.090 --> 02:22:52.100 align:start position:0%
the committee that talked about
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
some of the staff that never received
 
02:22:59.210 --> 02:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
one because of the timeline of when this
 
02:23:01.130 --> 02:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
was implemented these were would be some
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
of the senior staff on in a school
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
district and
 
02:23:06.910 --> 02:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
um so we were wondering whether or not
 
02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
that they might be an exception that
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
they could go back and do a background
 
02:23:13.969 --> 02:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
check they were just several questions
 
02:23:16.570 --> 02:23:16.580 align:start position:0%
that we really had about
 
02:23:19.969 --> 02:23:19.979 align:start position:0%
the need and whether or not this is a
 
02:23:23.450 --> 02:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
bill in search of a problem so that I
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
think Mr chair that was that was some of
 
02:23:27.250 --> 02:23:27.260 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we have thank you
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you uh I
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
think as I recall from the testimony
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the groups a language any group of
 
02:23:40.969 --> 02:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
employees who was meant to
 
02:23:44.450 --> 02:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
um uh eliminate the possibility of
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
background checks being conducted on
 
02:23:49.370 --> 02:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
certain individual employees which I
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
think would create many many more
 
02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:53.570 align:start position:0%
think would create many many more
problems

02:23:53.570 --> 02:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:23:58.570 --> 02:23:58.580 align:start position:0%
um and uh I think that
 
02:24:02.450 --> 02:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
if a background check is done
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
um January 1st
 
02:24:09.650 --> 02:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
and never repeated on that employee that
 
02:24:12.650 --> 02:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
is a large problem
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
um they could get arrested and convicted
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
of any crime uh you know a few months
 
02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:20.990 align:start position:0%
of any crime uh you know a few months
later

02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:21.830 align:start position:0%
later
um

02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:26.450 --> 02:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to provide the
 
02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility for school districts to do
 
02:24:33.309 --> 02:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
on a recurring basis as they see fit
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:46.969 --> 02:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
furthest representative Damon
 
02:24:49.610 --> 02:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think children's safety should
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
be a function of zip code if we need to
 
02:24:56.210 --> 02:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
improve the frequency of criminal record
 
02:24:58.750 --> 02:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
checks I think it should be attached to
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
re-licensing and be a consistent
 
02:25:04.250 --> 02:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
Statewide system
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
that I just don't understand why it
 
02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:11.210 --> 02:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative Luna
 
02:25:14.270 --> 02:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and I don't say
 
02:25:16.610 --> 02:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
this very often but I agree with what
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
um was just saying about about about
 
02:25:23.450 --> 02:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
student safety and I agree with what and
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put these together and
 
02:25:27.410 --> 02:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
agree with what represent Damon
 
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
um you know said uh said about this and
 
02:25:32.270 --> 02:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
and making sure that that some districts
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
do it some way some districts don't do
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
it don't do it at all and I think that's
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
largely the reason why we'd like to we'd
 
02:25:41.630 --> 02:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
suggest to work on this bill
 
02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
um for uh for this year and uh and bring
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
it bring it forward with an amendment
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
during the second year of this uh
 
02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
biennium so that so that it actually
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
solves a problem and and doesn't you
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
know doesn't create either other
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
problems or or you know or Worse
 
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
um well creating other problems is
 
02:26:05.210 --> 02:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
pretty bad but or actually not solve uh
 
02:26:07.250 --> 02:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
the problem that it's um that it's doing
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
02:26:12.889 --> 02:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
and so so I I would hope we'd hold on to
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
it and work on it okay I I do have a
 
02:26:17.929 --> 02:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
question here and maybe our
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
our individual here has been a
 
02:26:22.250 --> 02:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner of
 
02:26:24.650 --> 02:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
doe or maybe represent cascadden who's
 
02:26:27.050 --> 02:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
been an administrator is a teacher's
 
02:26:29.690 --> 02:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
ticket now renewed in this state mine
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
was renewed every five years I had to go
 
02:26:35.090 --> 02:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
back and take so many courses to get my
 
02:26:37.010 --> 02:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
certification renewed is it three or
 
02:26:39.530 --> 02:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
five years or what is the time frame now
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
does anybody know that of the two that I
 
02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:43.190 align:start position:0%
does anybody know that of the two that I
asked

02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
asked
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
I believe it's every three years for
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
certification The Five-Year Mark is
 
02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:51.490 align:start position:0%
certification The Five-Year Mark is
tenure

02:26:51.490 --> 02:26:51.500 align:start position:0%
tenure
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
well okay that which is another issue
 
02:26:55.849 --> 02:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
that's another issue yeah certifications
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
every three years every three years okay
 
02:27:03.010 --> 02:27:03.020 align:start position:0%
I think that's where where I was yes
 
02:27:05.570 --> 02:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
a few years ago when I left it was every
 
02:27:07.370 --> 02:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
three years every three
 
02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Miler one of the
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
things that we are that we've been
 
02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
talking about even this morning was the
 
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
issue of of student safety and
 
02:27:21.170 --> 02:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
child safety and I think one of the
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
questions is I in my notes reflect here
 
02:27:25.809 --> 02:27:25.819 align:start position:0%
there was a question about
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh service providers under the EFA
 
02:27:31.849 --> 02:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
program and how do we ensure that those
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
service providers are in fact would
 
02:27:36.050 --> 02:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
follow would they fall under the same
 
02:27:38.929 --> 02:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
kind of Aegis from a standpoint of
 
02:27:41.690 --> 02:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
ensuring that uh that their background
 
02:27:44.270 --> 02:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
checks are similar to if we if we want
 
02:27:46.849 --> 02:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
to move in this direction uh then how do
 
02:27:49.309 --> 02:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
we deal with all those uh individuals
 
02:27:51.770 --> 02:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
who are basically going to have a chance
 
02:27:55.969 --> 02:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
to to uh educate uh students so that was
 
02:27:58.370 --> 02:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
but that was a question that that line
 
02:28:00.050 --> 02:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
of thinking is going to be very
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
Divergent from the chapter of law we're
 
02:28:04.730 --> 02:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
in here this section which is dealing
 
02:28:07.309 --> 02:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
with employees of schools Charter
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
Schools Etc you look at right at the top
 
02:28:11.929 --> 02:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
of the bill what's to say the employee
 
02:28:13.010 --> 02:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
school administrative Unit School
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
District Public School
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
um it was just a question yeah but so I
 
02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
I think if we can keep it to this that
 
02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:20.990 align:start position:0%
I think if we can keep it to this that
scope

02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
scope
 
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.670 align:start position:0%
scope
um

02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:25.010 --> 02:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
I think we'll get probably to some kind
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
of conclusion here representative cascad
 
02:28:29.090 --> 02:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:29.809 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

02:28:29.809 --> 02:28:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that record chips
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
record checks for substitute teachers
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
within the same SAU are required every
 
02:28:40.250 --> 02:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
three years by Statute
 
02:28:41.929 --> 02:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
and I know this is asking for School
 
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
Employees and volunteers
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
and I wonder I mean I have to go back
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
and check this but
 
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
the pool of people who have never had a
 
02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
criminal record check pre the law
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
probably should have one
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
but then moving forward once an employee
 
02:29:03.170 --> 02:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
has had one does a code of ethics or the
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the code of conduct
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
sort of screen anything that an employee
 
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
might do out on the street or out in the
 
02:29:13.630 --> 02:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
community that's a violation
 
02:29:16.130 --> 02:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
isn't there something in those two
 
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
booklets that would trigger
 
02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
um some disciplinary action possibly yes
 
02:29:25.490 --> 02:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't need a follow-up
 
02:29:29.290 --> 02:29:29.300 align:start position:0%
criminal I don't know three layers of
 
02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
occurrence that can uh be applied to an
 
02:29:35.389 --> 02:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
individual who is in contrary to that
 
02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
code of professional conduct and and uh
 
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
we had a long discussion with that Brian
 
02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
you are part of that discussion several
 
02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
years ago or a year ago and we wrote a
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
letter an administrative letter from
 
02:29:51.410 --> 02:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
this committee here to doe suggesting
 
02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
that maybe there'd be a fourth which was
 
02:29:56.330 --> 02:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
a lesser of the other three steps are
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
presently there
 
02:30:02.210 --> 02:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I'm interested in knowing
 
02:30:05.809 --> 02:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
if in fact in your administrator you
 
02:30:08.809 --> 02:30:08.819 align:start position:0%
know uh you have a individual that is
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
um and let's stop it a notch
 
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
um with a youngster in a car so then
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
comes aggravated or yeah aggravated so
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
if that occurs does that put you into
 
02:30:26.990 --> 02:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
position where you have to make the
 
02:30:29.450 --> 02:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
decision or is the decision made for you
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
that they're they're you know no longer
 
02:30:34.370 --> 02:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
being to be a teacher
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
I would make that decision that um
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
first is a leave
 
02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
until an internal investigation is done
 
02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
um usually a police department would do
 
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
an investigation as well separate
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
um might warrant disciplinary action but
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
I think the teachers union would guard
 
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
against full dismissal
 
02:31:00.650 --> 02:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a process that's where I'm
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
aiming I think that there's a lot of
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
variables in making that decision yeah a
 
02:31:07.849 --> 02:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
lot of variables and so with that
 
02:31:10.670 --> 02:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some discretion so I'm
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
looking at these the these checks and
 
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'm just want to make sure that we're
 
02:31:18.410 --> 02:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
not going to take that that ability of
 
02:31:21.889 --> 02:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
the administration right to look at this
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
totally and would support people that
 
02:31:26.330 --> 02:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
you have and come up with the right
 
02:31:27.770 --> 02:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
decision rather than saying you're out
 
02:31:30.770 --> 02:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
the door and you've lost your ticket
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
right a lot goes into it before it gets
 
02:31:35.929 --> 02:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
to that point Thank You representative
 
02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a quick question
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
because I know it's it's come up before
 
02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
in in during hearings during discussion
 
02:31:48.170 --> 02:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
but um it does does the um does FBI have
 
02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
to approve or weigh in on on any
 
02:31:53.330 --> 02:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
language let's have safety okay that
 
02:32:01.490 --> 02:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:03.410 --> 02:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
02:32:04.849 --> 02:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity I'm
 
02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
captain Vic Muzzy I'm in charge of the
 
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
Justice information Bureau for the State
 
02:32:10.490 --> 02:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
Police and uh yes representative to
 
02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
answer your question any language
 
02:32:14.809 --> 02:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
changes would have to be submitted to
 
02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
the FBI
 
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
um we just attended a conference last
 
02:32:20.330 --> 02:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
week in Seattle
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
discussing the difficulties with that
 
02:32:24.889 --> 02:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
office at the moment at the FBI they're
 
02:32:27.290 --> 02:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
very short staffed the turnaround time
 
02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
can be quite extensive I think
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
two years ago we maybe had to wait eight
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
or ten months for a review and approval
 
02:32:37.630 --> 02:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
for 189.13 a through C
 
02:32:41.090 --> 02:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
so that is a problem at the moment but
 
02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:42.530 align:start position:0%
so that is a problem at the moment but
yes

02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
um given that the language change we
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
would have to have
 
02:32:48.050 --> 02:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
that review by the FBI and follow up Mr
 
02:32:49.969 --> 02:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
chair so so
 
02:32:51.770 --> 02:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
um you know thank you Captain Muzzy for
 
02:32:54.349 --> 02:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh for joining us this morning thank you
 
02:32:56.330 --> 02:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
for the question and and helping us
 
02:32:57.770 --> 02:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
through this
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
um would would it be possible that that
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
we could work with you to um you know if
 
02:33:08.809 --> 02:33:08.819 align:start position:0%
if we retain the bill and and and are
 
02:33:11.510 --> 02:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
looking at developing some language to
 
02:33:13.309 --> 02:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
maybe have the best shot at getting
 
02:33:16.250 --> 02:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
approval of what you know language that
 
02:33:18.730 --> 02:33:18.740 align:start position:0%
would would you know maybe be acceptable
 
02:33:21.050 --> 02:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
yes and this in fact came up in the
 
02:33:23.110 --> 02:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
discussion last week where
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
the conference we were at was uh
 
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
involved in multiple States I can't say
 
02:33:29.690 --> 02:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
every state but and we've tried to do
 
02:33:31.730 --> 02:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
just that is share language between
 
02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
states that we know has been approved
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
prior by the FBI and that seems to be
 
02:33:39.650 --> 02:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
not an exact science so in other words
 
02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
other states have adopted similar
 
02:33:42.650 --> 02:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
language that they know has passed that
 
02:33:44.690 --> 02:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
process when that's been submitted by
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
that state for some reason it's been
 
02:33:47.570 --> 02:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
rejected or returned and what have you
 
02:33:50.090 --> 02:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
so I think yes we can do that the other
 
02:33:51.770 --> 02:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say and I'm not really sure
 
02:33:54.170 --> 02:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
on the answer of this but the earlier we
 
02:33:56.389 --> 02:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
can submit this for approval or not the
 
02:33:58.670 --> 02:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
better in other words I don't know if
 
02:34:02.210 --> 02:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to submit a bill that
 
02:34:05.389 --> 02:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
hasn't passed just to see if in its
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
current form it would I don't know if
 
02:34:09.170 --> 02:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
that's I'd have to do some research
 
02:34:10.849 --> 02:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
myself and you folks probably know more
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
than I do so far as that goes but that
 
02:34:15.230 --> 02:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
comes to mind so that we don't have the
 
02:34:18.050 --> 02:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
delay that we suffered with 189 13 and
 
02:34:19.849 --> 02:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
having to wait 10 months before we can
 
02:34:21.710 --> 02:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
act on it because we're at the hands of
 
02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
the FBI to decide for us whether or not
 
02:34:26.330 --> 02:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
it's acceptable so certainly I think
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
those conversations in that process we
 
02:34:30.110 --> 02:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
would be open to that to make sure that
 
02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
we're not unnecessarily delayed and
 
02:34:34.610 --> 02:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
whatever the determination may be thank
 
02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:35.630 align:start position:0%
whatever the determination may be thank
you

02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further
 
02:34:39.530 --> 02:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative thank you chairman Kevin
 
02:34:40.610 --> 02:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for waiting
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
around and taking these yeah no problem
 
02:34:45.230 --> 02:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh glad to be here to follow uh in your
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
conference or in your dialogue with the
 
02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
other fellow uh people in your capacity
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the other states is that do you know
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
or have a record of any states that have
 
02:34:57.710 --> 02:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
annual or research with licenses as part
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the statute
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
not specifically no okay so you know
 
02:35:04.490 --> 02:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
that that's happening out there no with
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
this you mean for this process in other
 
02:35:07.969 --> 02:35:07.979 align:start position:0%
states if it's happening I mean yeah for
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
and for other states uh they do
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
recertification do you know of any
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
states that require or it's like tag
 
02:35:16.210 --> 02:35:16.220 align:start position:0%
it's attached to part of their process
 
02:35:20.510 --> 02:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
recertification I'm not okay
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you further further questions
 
02:35:24.170 --> 02:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
represent Cass cabin
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
um just looking at the Statue there is a
 
02:35:30.170 --> 02:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
section of the 189 13c the criminal
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
history records check on a candidate is
 
02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
valid for a period of three years which
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
if the committee was going towards every
 
02:35:41.330 --> 02:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
certification period it would match this
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:48.889 --> 02:35:48.899 align:start position:0%
are there any yes represent Milo thank
 
02:35:50.929 --> 02:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh captain could you
 
02:35:53.809 --> 02:35:53.819 align:start position:0%
outline for us what goes into a criminal
 
02:35:56.270 --> 02:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
records check I mean how does it how
 
02:35:57.530 --> 02:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
does it work
 
02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
certainly I don't know if
 
02:36:02.809 --> 02:36:02.819 align:start position:0%
my partner here would join me
 
02:36:06.170 --> 02:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
um I mean since we're both here so I I
 
02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
can explain it from I think probably
 
02:36:11.570 --> 02:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
somewhat of the same level but
 
02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:12.910 align:start position:0%
somewhat of the same level but
um

02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:16.450 --> 02:36:16.460 align:start position:0%
well I'll let you explain
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
the resident expert good afternoon my
 
02:36:21.170 --> 02:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
name is Christine Shea and I'm the
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
criminal records unit supervisor
 
02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
and as far as the criminal records
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
with that you get two portions to that
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have the state only check which for
 
02:36:37.370 --> 02:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
Education you get everything
 
02:36:39.530 --> 02:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
um and then we submit the fingerprints
 
02:36:43.330 --> 02:36:43.340 align:start position:0%
to the FBI and the FBI sends us
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
everything that they have from the other
 
02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:46.790 align:start position:0%
everything that they have from the other
states

02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:36:49.309 --> 02:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
in which you receive all the records as
 
02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
well on that
 
02:36:55.010 --> 02:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
well yes what kind of records are you
 
02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
any criminal records that they have
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
that are fingerprint based so any charge
 
02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
if they were arrested for
 
02:37:10.010 --> 02:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
drugs if they were arrested
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
for I mean the list is extensive yeah so
 
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
maybe I can help explain a little bit
 
02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:17.450 align:start position:0%
maybe I can help explain a little bit
um

02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
a criminal record consists of things
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
like complaints as accepted for filing
 
02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
arrests and dispositions so each
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
incident we'll call it has a cycle and
 
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
typically you'll see on the on the
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
criminal record things are are
 
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
delineated by cycle and so there's
 
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
usually three entries for every incident
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
those being the complaints that were
 
02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
filed at the court or the arrest the
 
02:37:41.389 --> 02:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
complaints that were filed at the court
 
02:37:42.889 --> 02:37:42.899 align:start position:0%
and then the disposition that comes from
 
02:37:44.450 --> 02:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
the court
 
02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:45.469 align:start position:0%
the court
um

02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
and so we have that a state record now
 
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
our state record may or may not be
 
02:37:52.670 --> 02:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
fingerprint supported which means
 
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
offenses that you're convicted of in in
 
02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses that you're convicted
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
of in New Hampshire will appear on your
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire only record reason being
 
02:38:02.210 --> 02:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
is the FBI doesn't care what your name
 
02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
is the FBI cares what your fingerprints
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
look like and that's the only data that
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
they will put on their record is is
 
02:38:10.730 --> 02:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
those instances that are fingerprint
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
supported so the state record may
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
actually have more information on it
 
02:38:15.710 --> 02:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
than the federal record because of the
 
02:38:18.050 --> 02:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
way information gets on the federal
 
02:38:19.849 --> 02:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
record which has to be by fingerprints
 
02:38:21.410 --> 02:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
and the best example I can think of is
 
02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
if you're in a DW if you if if an
 
02:38:26.809 --> 02:38:26.819 align:start position:0%
individual were to be involved in a car
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
crash let's say and they were accused
 
02:38:30.530 --> 02:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
and found guilty of of drunk driving
 
02:38:33.469 --> 02:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
they may be in the hospital and so that
 
02:38:35.570 --> 02:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
investigation that goes on that person
 
02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
may be hospitalized we may not get
 
02:38:39.889 --> 02:38:39.899 align:start position:0%
fingerprints for that arrest and thereby
 
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
that offense would not appear on the
 
02:38:42.650 --> 02:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
federal record but would appear on their
 
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
state record and so that's why that the
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
records can can be and sometimes are
 
02:38:49.550 --> 02:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
different now every state
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
a record if you will that has
 
02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
fingerprints you're going to see those
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
on both records so you'll see it on the
 
02:38:57.950 --> 02:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
state record and on the FBI record so
 
02:39:00.050 --> 02:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
um in the FBI record often you know
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
contains the same Cycles if you will
 
02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
that the state record does so it's
 
02:39:05.399 --> 02:39:06.410 align:start position:0%
that the state record does so it's
um

02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:07.969 --> 02:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
from what we've heard from the industry
 
02:39:10.250 --> 02:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of information typically
 
02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and and we've done some trainings
 
02:39:14.210 --> 02:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
with attorney Fenton to help the saus
 
02:39:16.490 --> 02:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
and and administrators understand what
 
02:39:18.230 --> 02:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
that information means how to get how to
 
02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
look at it how to interpret you know
 
02:39:22.250 --> 02:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
what might be there and things so
 
02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:23.389 align:start position:0%
what might be there and things so
um

02:39:23.389 --> 02:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:26.270 --> 02:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
for us we don't have you know a state
 
02:39:28.610 --> 02:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
fingerprint we rely on the FBI so I you
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
know all of our fingerprints um get
 
02:39:32.090 --> 02:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
submitted to the FBI and there's there's
 
02:39:35.450 --> 02:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
been some discussion on uh State checks
 
02:39:37.010 --> 02:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
with fingerprints that's not the way
 
02:39:38.570 --> 02:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
that we we operate at the moment so we
 
02:39:40.730 --> 02:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
have to rely on the FBI for those things
 
02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:41.690 align:start position:0%
have to rely on the FBI for those things
so

02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
I guess that hopefully answers the
 
02:39:46.730 --> 02:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
question yeah yeah I I
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
two two questions one are there any
 
02:39:53.330 --> 02:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
charges that can be exonerated
 
02:39:57.469 --> 02:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
from the record one and two what is the
 
02:40:01.010 --> 02:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
fee for the criminal record check
 
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
yes to answer your first question
 
02:40:04.730 --> 02:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
through the process of an annulment
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
um so we basically you know the person
 
02:40:08.210 --> 02:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
would go to court and they would file
 
02:40:09.770 --> 02:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
for an annulment that would be reviewed
 
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
and if the court decided yes this charge
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
can be annulled we get notice of that
 
02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's a manual process for us now when
 
02:40:17.090 --> 02:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
we go in and literally delete that from
 
02:40:18.410 --> 02:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
the record
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and the charge for a state
 
02:40:24.290 --> 02:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
um conviction check is twenty five
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
dollars okay
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
and the charge for an annulment is a
 
02:40:30.830 --> 02:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
hundred if you're if you're asking as
 
02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
far as the FBI check just so there's two
 
02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
different fees there for the FBI check
 
02:40:39.790 --> 02:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
which would include this state check is
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
40.25 for an employee
 
02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and 21.25 for a volunteer
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
which includes the FBI and state check
 
02:40:52.730 --> 02:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
I have a question regarding your FBI the
 
02:40:54.770 --> 02:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
what you get from the FBI we have a
 
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
number of
 
02:40:57.889 --> 02:40:57.899 align:start position:0%
well not a number out but we do have
 
02:41:01.309 --> 02:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
teachers or administrators or folks
 
02:41:02.929 --> 02:41:02.939 align:start position:0%
working in schools that are coming in
 
02:41:06.830 --> 02:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
that may be Canadian or does the FBI
 
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
check go further and that I'm not
 
02:41:10.610 --> 02:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
picking on Canada you know but I was
 
02:41:13.070 --> 02:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
brought up there so
 
02:41:16.130 --> 02:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
um so what my my question would and I'm
 
02:41:20.469 --> 02:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
not checking for myself either but uh
 
02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
but I I'm curious to know whether when
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
you do your FBI check that there's any
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
linkage with the where this individual
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
may have come from
 
02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:32.590 align:start position:0%
may have come from
internationally

02:41:32.590 --> 02:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
internationally
 
02:41:35.090 --> 02:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
internationally I would need to get
 
02:41:37.730 --> 02:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
clarification on that for you
 
02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
um they will tell us as far as the state
 
02:41:41.870 --> 02:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
they were born in in that kind of
 
02:41:43.849 --> 02:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
information but as far as if it's
 
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
International I have to research that a
 
02:41:47.630 --> 02:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
little further thank you for what it's
 
02:41:50.090 --> 02:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
worth we do see military charges you
 
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
know on a record at times I can't say as
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
I've ever seen a foreign charge or a
 
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
charge from another another place but
 
02:41:58.910 --> 02:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
certainly military you know charges are
 
02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
on there and which can be sometimes
 
02:42:02.929 --> 02:42:02.939 align:start position:0%
difficult to discern what the outcome of
 
02:42:05.389 --> 02:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
those may have been and
 
02:42:07.730 --> 02:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I've I've been there and done that
 
02:42:10.429 --> 02:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
article of what five or so started out
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a young officer and
 
02:42:13.969 --> 02:42:13.979 align:start position:0%
you're acting like judge jury and
 
02:42:16.130 --> 02:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
everything in one time right
 
02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:16.870 align:start position:0%
everything in one time right
um

02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
so are there further questions
 
02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
02:42:25.550 --> 02:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I apologize if I
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
missed this So currently yeah school
 
02:42:32.270 --> 02:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
system employees are going through the
 
02:42:36.670 --> 02:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:40.370 --> 02:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
so that would Encompass if they had a
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
situation in another state prior to
 
02:42:44.110 --> 02:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
being here
 
02:42:46.910 --> 02:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
once they get the federal check that's
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
based off their fingerprints so that's
 
02:42:51.770 --> 02:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
gonna link any other charges from
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
another state thank you for clarifying
 
02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:55.370 align:start position:0%
another state thank you for clarifying
so

02:42:55.370 --> 02:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
if you sit there just a second based
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing here there seems to be
 
02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
some very good questions which have been
 
02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
asked from the committee and good
 
02:43:06.889 --> 02:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
information we've heard from the the
 
02:43:06.899 --> 02:43:08.750 align:start position:0%
information we've heard from the the
department

02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:43:11.270 --> 02:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
I I'm getting close to the point where
 
02:43:13.250 --> 02:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
we may don't want to take any action
 
02:43:15.230 --> 02:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's not an early bill
 
02:43:17.450 --> 02:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
and we may want to really sort through
 
02:43:19.070 --> 02:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more
 
02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:20.510 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more
and

02:43:20.510 --> 02:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:23.090 --> 02:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and work with you and maybe I can
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
talk with Eddie Edwards when he comes
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
over for the public school
 
02:43:28.010 --> 02:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
infrastructure commission and and work
 
02:43:30.410 --> 02:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
with him too but I I think there's much
 
02:43:33.290 --> 02:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
more we have to learn here so we don't
 
02:43:34.849 --> 02:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
step somewhere where we're you know
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to end up next year trying to undo
 
02:43:38.570 --> 02:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
what we did this year
 
02:43:38.580 --> 02:43:39.469 align:start position:0%
what we did this year
um

02:43:39.469 --> 02:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:41.570 --> 02:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
so and I just think from our standpoint
 
02:43:43.010 --> 02:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
based upon what we've heard of it's
 
02:43:44.809 --> 02:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
called siegelu and that's an acronym
 
02:43:46.969 --> 02:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
that I suppose stands for something it's
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
just fun to say so far is the opposite
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
the FBI that reviews these things and
 
02:43:52.610 --> 02:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
um we literally spoke last week about
 
02:43:54.830 --> 02:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get a training from them to
 
02:43:56.570 --> 02:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
help educate us on what the standard
 
02:43:58.429 --> 02:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
should be uh so that we're not
 
02:44:00.110 --> 02:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily wasting time and there was
 
02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
quite healthy discussion on some
 
02:44:03.370 --> 02:44:03.380 align:start position:0%
struggles that other states had had
 
02:44:05.389 --> 02:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
adopting similar language from a
 
02:44:07.370 --> 02:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
neighboring state that had been passed
 
02:44:08.450 --> 02:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
and things like that and then all of a
 
02:44:09.969 --> 02:44:09.979 align:start position:0%
sudden they're up against this wall so
 
02:44:12.590 --> 02:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
the industry from our perspective is
 
02:44:14.929 --> 02:44:14.939 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way to help smooth this
 
02:44:16.610 --> 02:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
process out understanding that all the
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
other states are suffering from the 10 8
 
02:44:21.290 --> 02:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
or 10 month delay and again I think
 
02:44:23.150 --> 02:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
thinking proactively is where I'm coming
 
02:44:24.830 --> 02:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
from when I say I don't know what point
 
02:44:27.650 --> 02:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate to send them
 
02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
proposed language and I you know I'm not
 
02:44:32.510 --> 02:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with whether that would be a
 
02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
good practice or not or whether that's
 
02:44:36.410 --> 02:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
possible but as I see it I just don't
 
02:44:38.030 --> 02:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
want to run into a delay like we had
 
02:44:40.250 --> 02:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
before in that in that instance
 
02:44:42.110 --> 02:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that's certainly advisable
 
02:44:44.210 --> 02:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
that we consider doing that so we don't
 
02:44:45.770 --> 02:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
run down the path
 
02:44:47.809 --> 02:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
you know go farther down the rabbit hole
 
02:44:49.250 --> 02:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
and have to figure out how to get out of
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:53.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah yeah

02:44:53.950 --> 02:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:44:56.809 --> 02:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
we should be always clearing stuff
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
through you know people like Diana
 
02:45:02.330 --> 02:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
Fenton and yeah and and you guys and
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
maybe even across the street yeah you
 
02:45:06.410 --> 02:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
know and I would say in this case
 
02:45:08.510 --> 02:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
in my personal opinion you know what
 
02:45:10.130 --> 02:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
you're not asking the FBI to release
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
their record
 
02:45:13.610 --> 02:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
to another body or another group you're
 
02:45:14.809 --> 02:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
really saying we just want to release it
 
02:45:17.450 --> 02:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
more often so in theory I think the the
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill should be fine I'm
 
02:45:21.050 --> 02:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
not the FBI and I don't know how they
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
think on a daily basis but it I would
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
see a bigger hang up if we were trying
 
02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
to disseminate their record to a new
 
02:45:29.270 --> 02:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
group of people that would be probably
 
02:45:32.090 --> 02:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
cause more concern versus what we're
 
02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
really saying is here we just want to do
 
02:45:36.650 --> 02:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
this on a more frequent basis which I
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
can't imagine would be a problem but
 
02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
again I don't I don't want to speak out
 
02:45:41.630 --> 02:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
of turn on that either thank you Captain
 
02:45:44.110 --> 02:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
it's been good Vice
 
02:45:47.929 --> 02:45:47.939 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah I just like to not take any
 
02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
action right now so if we have to do
 
02:45:52.790 --> 02:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
something we have to March 16th where we
 
02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision on this so we
 
02:45:56.030 --> 02:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
got some time here and we'd very much
 
02:45:57.770 --> 02:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
like to work with you further on this
 
02:46:00.410 --> 02:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
certainly and we'll get Diane involved
 
02:46:02.290 --> 02:46:02.300 align:start position:0%
with it as well
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
we'll put a subcommittee together and
 
02:46:07.849 --> 02:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
and yeah I know committees are
 
02:46:09.889 --> 02:46:09.899 align:start position:0%
committees but this one right here is
 
02:46:12.050 --> 02:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's important and we in support we do
 
02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
it right
 
02:46:16.429 --> 02:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
so so thank you once again I want to
 
02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for waiting for your lunch
 
02:46:19.429 --> 02:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
break and we did have a little bit in
 
02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
the back of the room that you were going
 
02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
to break for lunch ahead of time so I'm
 
02:46:24.889 --> 02:46:24.899 align:start position:0%
disappointed that I didn't bet I would
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
have I would have had a free lunch well
 
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for waiting you're welcome to
 
02:46:30.050 --> 02:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
join me I got peanut butter and jelly
 
02:46:32.330 --> 02:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
sandwich here a little lunchtime humor I
 
02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to say thank you for her thank
 
02:46:36.110 --> 02:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you thank you
 
02:46:38.450 --> 02:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
so with that we're not going to take any
 
02:46:40.730 --> 02:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
action on this bill right now and we're
 
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
going to break for our lunch
 
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and we have
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
about five or so bills left to do today
 
02:46:53.090 --> 02:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
so we should be able to clean up fairly
 
02:46:55.490 --> 02:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
quickly so let's come back around one
 
02:46:55.500 --> 02:46:56.929 align:start position:0%
quickly so let's come back around one
o'clock

02:46:56.929 --> 02:46:56.939 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
02:46:59.270 --> 02:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
if you need a little bit more time if
 
02:47:01.790 --> 02:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to the cafeteria lines yes
 
02:47:04.849 --> 02:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
yeah and and during that lunch the
 
02:47:07.309 --> 02:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
Republicans will caucus
 
02:47:09.730 --> 02:47:09.740 align:start position:0%
pardon me oh okay
 
02:47:15.309 --> 02:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:31.330 --> 02:47:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:42.170 --> 02:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
Linda work I'm not going to start to 1
 
02:47:44.929 --> 02:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
15. it's a 12 15 we'll start at 1 15 if
 
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:48.840 --> 02:50:26.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:17.030 --> 03:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:17.040 --> 03:53:45.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:53:45.290 --> 03:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
will have a subcommittee work on that
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
bill and we also are going to have a
 
03:53:53.510 --> 03:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work done on the
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
indemnification stuff
 
03:53:58.250 --> 03:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
but um now we're down to the next one
 
03:54:01.389 --> 03:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
here which is dealing with HB 380
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh FN relative non-academic surveys
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
administered by a public school or a
 
03:54:10.750 --> 03:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School to its students
 
03:54:12.830 --> 03:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald you recognized
 
03:54:18.889 --> 03:54:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:21.769 --> 03:54:21.779 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
03:54:21.779 --> 03:54:23.570 align:start position:0%
is there a second
second

03:54:23.570 --> 03:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay represent cordial he beats
 
03:54:26.710 --> 03:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
03:54:29.570 --> 03:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
so the motion's been made by represent
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
McDonald's second by representative
 
03:54:35.689 --> 03:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
cordelli referencing 380. it's open to
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
discussion from the maker of the motion
 
03:54:41.450 --> 03:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have some serious
 
03:54:43.010 --> 03:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill which is why I
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
made the motion of itl but the biggest
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
being that non-academic surveys since
 
03:54:49.969 --> 03:54:49.979 align:start position:0%
they are not related to academics we
 
03:54:51.650 --> 03:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
need to give parents and students
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
increased awareness of what they are
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
agreeing to so changing this to an
 
03:54:58.849 --> 03:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
opt-out policy might make some students
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
and parents unaware of what they're
 
03:55:02.330 --> 03:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
agreeing to and that's just my primary
 
03:55:04.250 --> 03:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
concern among a few other reasons so
 
03:55:06.590 --> 03:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
03:55:06.600 --> 03:55:09.530 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
cordelli

03:55:09.530 --> 03:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:13.490 --> 03:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to add
 
03:55:18.650 --> 03:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
to the record on this one that despite
 
03:55:20.510 --> 03:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony we heard I have
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
done a bit of research and
 
03:55:25.610 --> 03:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
um this bill does specifically exempt
 
03:55:28.429 --> 03:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
from the ability to opt out
 
03:55:31.130 --> 03:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
um CDC developed surveys beyond the
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
youth risk assessment survey my research
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
shows that there are other CDC surveys
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
that have been developed including some
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
very concerning looking ones coming down
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
from the World Health Organization and
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
the United Nations so there would be
 
03:55:46.450 --> 03:55:46.460 align:start position:0%
theoretically a whole lot of surveys
 
03:55:50.330 --> 03:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
Exempted by this bill so represent
 
03:55:51.650 --> 03:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
Belcher can you please explain a little
 
03:55:53.689 --> 03:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
bit more for me on this one we have the
 
03:55:56.570 --> 03:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
CDC survey that we're talking about with
 
03:55:58.309 --> 03:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
the exception in law the youth risk
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
behavior survey
 
03:56:02.929 --> 03:56:02.939 align:start position:0%
correct now is this bill opening it up
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
to other uh CDC surveys correct if you
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
look at the language of this bill it
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
opens it up to any CDC develop survey
 
03:56:16.370 --> 03:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
can you show me where that is in 3A
 
03:56:19.309 --> 03:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I think it's lines 12 and 13. there
 
03:56:28.729 --> 03:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:28.739 --> 03:56:31.370 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:56:31.370 --> 03:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.380 --> 03:56:36.410 align:start position:0%
 
working

03:56:36.410 --> 03:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:39.710 --> 03:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
56 funded by the CDC right
 
03:56:39.720 --> 03:56:41.389 align:start position:0%
56 funded by the CDC right
okay

03:56:41.389 --> 03:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Tanner
 
03:56:47.090 --> 03:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
these are prevention programs as listed
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
in here
 
03:56:50.150 --> 03:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
um and you said that the these surveys
 
03:56:55.130 --> 03:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
that open it up to the world have uh U.N
 
03:56:58.610 --> 03:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
or World Health Organization type
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
surveys they they wouldn't be
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this
 
03:57:04.729 --> 03:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
as a prevention survey would they
 
03:57:07.070 --> 03:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
if I may answer that because this
 
03:57:09.950 --> 03:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
language in the bill opens it up to CDC
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
surveys the specific surveys I'm
 
03:57:15.650 --> 03:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
speaking to in my research are CDC
 
03:57:19.130 --> 03:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
surveys that have been developed in
 
03:57:20.450 --> 03:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the World Health
 
03:57:22.550 --> 03:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
Organization and the United Nations and
 
03:57:22.560 --> 03:57:24.070 align:start position:0%
Organization and the United Nations and
UNESCO

03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
UNESCO
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
so yes those organizations are directly
 
03:57:29.150 --> 03:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
involved for prevention
 
03:57:33.910 --> 03:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.410 --> 03:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
I I don't have the name of them right in
 
03:57:38.269 --> 03:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
front of me at the moment
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
03:57:41.990 --> 03:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add thank you I'd like to
 
03:57:43.610 --> 03:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
ask representative Belcher for further
 
03:57:46.429 --> 03:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
clarification because that line
 
03:57:50.870 --> 03:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh 12 into 13. clearly says surveys
 
03:57:52.849 --> 03:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
related to other I'm emphasizing
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
prevention as representative Tanner did
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
and also funded by the Centers for
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
Disease Control and prevention CDC is
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
not funding UNESCO or the World Health
 
03:58:01.080 --> 03:58:04.490 align:start position:0%
not funding UNESCO or the World Health
Organization

03:58:04.490 --> 03:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I don't believe I've ever made
 
03:58:08.450 --> 03:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
any claim that would contradict that
 
03:58:10.729 --> 03:58:10.739 align:start position:0%
these are CDC surveys they are available
 
03:58:13.010 --> 03:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
on the the at least the descriptions on
 
03:58:15.950 --> 03:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
the CDC website and they are partnered
 
03:58:19.250 --> 03:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
with UNESCO the UN and the World Health
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
Organization in developing and
 
03:58:22.189 --> 03:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
administering these surveys specifically
 
03:58:23.750 --> 03:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
designed to be administered to school
 
03:58:28.090 --> 03:58:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:31.790 --> 03:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:33.650 --> 03:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
represent miler
 
03:58:36.170 --> 03:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think the important
 
03:58:38.450 --> 03:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
part of this as I see is that it
 
03:58:41.330 --> 03:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
provides notice prior to any of these
 
03:58:43.729 --> 03:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
surveys being given and I think the
 
03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
Dilemma that we've had before
 
03:58:50.510 --> 03:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
is that uh the opt-in uh I think uh
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
these first of all these surveys are
 
03:58:55.870 --> 03:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
done to help
 
03:58:59.689 --> 03:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
schools and other agencies to identify
 
03:59:01.670 --> 03:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be addressed in
 
03:59:03.650 --> 03:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
schools or in communities
 
03:59:06.910 --> 03:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
and by having the current opt-in program
 
03:59:09.769 --> 03:59:09.779 align:start position:0%
the issue of the reliability of the
 
03:59:11.929 --> 03:59:11.939 align:start position:0%
numbers that need to be taken to to make
 
03:59:15.170 --> 03:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
these reliables the results reliable uh
 
03:59:19.090 --> 03:59:19.100 align:start position:0%
is is difficult by opting out
 
03:59:22.490 --> 03:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
parents can do that as it says here that
 
03:59:24.110 --> 03:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
the written notice is given to students
 
03:59:28.130 --> 03:59:28.140 align:start position:0%
are listed on electronically on websites
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
Etc so
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that we'd want to
 
03:59:32.750 --> 03:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
get some of this data
 
03:59:36.070 --> 03:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that the various service agencies
 
03:59:36.080 --> 03:59:37.929 align:start position:0%
so that the various service agencies
assisting

03:59:37.929 --> 03:59:37.939 align:start position:0%
assisting
 
03:59:40.910 --> 03:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
student Behavior Etc and other needs
 
03:59:43.070 --> 03:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed in school in
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
schools and communities needs to be done
 
03:59:47.929 --> 03:59:47.939 align:start position:0%
so I I don't understand why there's a
 
03:59:49.610 --> 03:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
problem there
 
03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to just take a break
 
03:59:54.410 --> 03:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
for a second I had uh the
 
03:59:56.870 --> 03:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
um Deputy Chief of Staff just inform me
 
03:59:59.090 --> 03:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
due to the severe weather we are
 
04:00:01.090 --> 04:00:01.100 align:start position:0%
currently experiencing the temperatures
 
04:00:03.769 --> 04:00:03.779 align:start position:0%
plummeting right now speaker Packard is
 
04:00:05.570 --> 04:00:05.580 align:start position:0%

04:00:07.610 --> 04:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
at the store Street Garage park closer
 
04:00:10.010 --> 04:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
to the state house and lob before
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%

04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%

move your car closer we currently have
 
04:00:24.410 --> 04:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
space available in the upper lob garage
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
which is accessible via Capital uh
 
04:00:28.490 --> 04:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
Street that's right over here in the
 
04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
side in various Street spaces and
 
04:00:33.349 --> 04:00:33.359 align:start position:0%

04:00:37.370 --> 04:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
yellow legislative bags Protective
 
04:00:39.290 --> 04:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
Services can assist you in finding a
 
04:00:41.210 --> 04:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
space if you have any trouble
 
04:00:43.010 --> 04:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
do we have any people here that would
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
like to take advantage of that right now
 
04:00:46.490 --> 04:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
because we're going to be here for I
 
04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
would say at least to 3 30.
 
04:00:49.560 --> 04:00:51.469 align:start position:0%
would say at least to 3 30.
um

04:00:51.469 --> 04:00:51.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:54.170 --> 04:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
and and um it's going to be a little
 
04:00:57.410 --> 04:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:00.590 --> 04:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you want to move right
 
04:01:00.600 --> 04:01:01.269 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you want to move right
now

04:01:01.269 --> 04:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:01:03.650 --> 04:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
you can probably get a ride down there
 
04:01:05.389 --> 04:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
too instead of having a walk down there
 
04:01:20.150 --> 04:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:22.130 --> 04:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
I have something to do with the danger
 
04:01:23.929 --> 04:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
in the garage it's just that extreme
 
04:01:23.939 --> 04:01:29.170 align:start position:0%
in the garage it's just that extreme
temperature

04:01:29.170 --> 04:01:29.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh so it's not you don't have to do
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
anything if you don't want to do it but
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to you know we can we
 
04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
can you know take a short short break
 
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
and you can hit hit you know the garage
 
04:01:44.030 --> 04:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
and get your car up here and park it
 
04:01:46.610 --> 04:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
right in back of the building here where
 
04:01:49.130 --> 04:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
there's lots of spaces available
 
04:01:49.140 --> 04:01:55.570 align:start position:0%
there's lots of spaces available
foreign

04:01:55.570 --> 04:01:55.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:57.769 --> 04:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
they'll do that for you
 
04:01:59.450 --> 04:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
you can buzz it and they'll just open
 
04:02:00.769 --> 04:02:00.779 align:start position:0%
you up
 
04:02:06.550 --> 04:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:10.570 --> 04:02:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.790 --> 04:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
we will we will discuss but because of
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
this we will not take any action on
 
04:02:28.570 --> 04:02:28.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
well what I would suggest you know
 
04:02:32.040 --> 04:02:32.689 align:start position:0%
well what I would suggest you know
um

04:02:32.689 --> 04:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:35.570 --> 04:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
when you go down go to the desk where
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
you see Bob down there and ask him we'd
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
like to go to the garage but we'd like
 
04:02:43.490 --> 04:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:46.090 --> 04:02:46.100 align:start position:0%
unless you feel you can do it quickly
 
04:02:48.530 --> 04:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
and ask them how long it takes the fan
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you when it comes to four degrees
 
04:03:17.090 --> 04:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you can tolerate
 
04:24:12.910 --> 04:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:12.920 --> 04:24:15.070 align:start position:0%
 
380.

04:24:15.070 --> 04:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
380.
 
04:24:17.630 --> 04:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
off topic I just checked whether on top
 
04:24:20.150 --> 04:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
of Mount Washington and are down
 
04:24:22.969 --> 04:24:22.979 align:start position:0%
approaching minus 30.
 
04:24:22.979 --> 04:24:25.969 align:start position:0%
approaching minus 30.
tonight

04:24:25.969 --> 04:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
minus 30 degrees
 
04:24:32.510 --> 04:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
no that's real temperature that's the
 
04:24:34.610 --> 04:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
real temperature that we're not quite
 
04:24:37.250 --> 04:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
there yet but by late afternoon they
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
expect to be down about minus 30.
 
04:24:40.800 --> 04:24:49.030 align:start position:0%
expect to be down about minus 30.
okay

04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.490 --> 04:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
HB 380 we're discussing this relative
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys administered by a
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
public school or a Charter Public School
 
04:24:59.090 --> 04:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:02.170 --> 04:25:02.180 align:start position:0%
trying to recoup where we were
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to add some
 
04:25:09.290 --> 04:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
further contacts and perhaps correct a
 
04:25:10.490 --> 04:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
little bit of testimony we heard before
 
04:25:12.050 --> 04:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
a Break
 
04:25:15.410 --> 04:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
um it was stated that their
 
04:25:18.830 --> 04:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
um is opt-in opt-out procedures and such
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh for CDC related surveys but I would
 
04:25:23.870 --> 04:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
note that the language in the bill
 
04:25:26.510 --> 04:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
actually says the policy shall include
 
04:25:28.010 --> 04:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
an exception from the consent
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
requirement for the Youth risk behavior
 
04:25:33.650 --> 04:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
survey developed by the CDC goes on to
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
add to continue that exemption to this
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
new language that expands it beyond the
 
04:25:42.410 --> 04:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
that survey to all CDC uh potential
 
04:25:45.050 --> 04:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
surveys and then it strikes the part of
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
the policy that would allow for an
 
04:25:49.610 --> 04:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
opt-out so there would under this be no
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:00.170 --> 04:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:02.689 --> 04:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to
 
04:26:06.170 --> 04:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
I guess give an anecdote
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
um people say well it's it's on notices
 
04:26:13.130 --> 04:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
given and that notices I don't think has
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
struck out
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
um notices given so the parents would
 
04:26:16.680 --> 04:26:17.630 align:start position:0%
um notices given so the parents would
know

04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:26:19.490 --> 04:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
but the problem is
 
04:26:22.910 --> 04:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
notices given by putting it someplace on
 
04:26:25.610 --> 04:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
the school district website and when my
 
04:26:27.290 --> 04:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
granddaughter was living with me during
 
04:26:30.410 --> 04:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
High School I was on that website every
 
04:26:32.689 --> 04:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
day I was in communication with her
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
teachers every day right
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
that website is huge I didn't read the
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
whole website every day I was on I was
 
04:26:42.050 --> 04:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
in communication with her teachers I was
 
04:26:44.809 --> 04:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
looking at how she was doing every day I
 
04:26:47.330 --> 04:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
never saw a notice and then my
 
04:26:50.809 --> 04:26:50.819 align:start position:0%
granddaughter came home absolutely upset
 
04:26:54.410 --> 04:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
with me mad at me grandma why didn't you
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
walk me out do you know what that stuff
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
asked it was so embarrassing I mean she
 
04:27:01.610 --> 04:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
was just she was a very private person
 
04:27:03.769 --> 04:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
and the idea that even people were
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
asking her these questions was extremely
 
04:27:09.050 --> 04:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
upsetting to her she didn't talk to me
 
04:27:10.490 --> 04:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
for two hours
 
04:27:12.769 --> 04:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
she was so mad at me and that was not
 
04:27:16.010 --> 04:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
normal for her but she was so mad at me
 
04:27:18.110 --> 04:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
because she had to and they told her she
 
04:27:20.330 --> 04:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
had they didn't say oh as a student you
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
can decide not to do this they didn't
 
04:27:23.689 --> 04:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
tell her that
 
04:27:26.030 --> 04:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
and and that she had to answer these
 
04:27:28.490 --> 04:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
private personal questions that she
 
04:27:30.590 --> 04:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
didn't you know she was very private
 
04:27:32.750 --> 04:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
still is very private
 
04:27:36.110 --> 04:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I I still remember that that was so
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
upsetting to her that she had to answer
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock just a
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
clarification that representative's
 
04:27:46.080 --> 04:27:46.910 align:start position:0%
clarification that representative's
comment

04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:27:50.090 --> 04:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
um like under the 1819 when they have
 
04:27:52.729 --> 04:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
the new Doc policy and then talk to
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
another bill it says that they're right
 
04:27:56.689 --> 04:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
there that the the parents have gotten
 
04:27:59.030 --> 04:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
can opt out of their neck of a survey
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
and I understand what you're looking at
 
04:28:02.450 --> 04:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
that was or where it's lined out but
 
04:28:04.250 --> 04:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
that puts it back in down there and see
 
04:28:05.450 --> 04:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
they can either do electronically you
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
need to write another more so that
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's in there it has this has
 
04:28:11.870 --> 04:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
safeguards it's on the website it's 10
 
04:28:14.090 --> 04:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
days in advance the schools have it in
 
04:28:15.710 --> 04:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
their hand the kids know what's coming
 
04:28:18.290 --> 04:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
they advertise it and and then parents
 
04:28:20.330 --> 04:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
can opt out Simply electronically just
 
04:28:22.610 --> 04:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
quick by doing else and I think it's
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
well I think we're making it more than
 
04:28:27.110 --> 04:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
it really is represent McDonald
 
04:28:29.689 --> 04:28:29.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd just like to add
 
04:28:32.689 --> 04:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
that the what representative Blake has
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
just said about her granddaughter we
 
04:28:36.170 --> 04:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
should really stop and take a minute to
 
04:28:37.790 --> 04:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
think if students feel that way they
 
04:28:39.769 --> 04:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
feel embarrassed at school no student
 
04:28:41.210 --> 04:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
should be made to feel that way because
 
04:28:43.729 --> 04:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
of a survey that as it is written in the
 
04:28:45.710 --> 04:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
context of the bill has no academic
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
value and the survey mentioned the
 
04:28:49.670 --> 04:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
youthless behavior survey well I took
 
04:28:52.969 --> 04:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
that survey twice in 2020 and 2022 was I
 
04:28:54.410 --> 04:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
told that this was something I could opt
 
04:28:56.570 --> 04:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
out of no I was not students are not
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
made aware that they have that ability
 
04:29:00.530 --> 04:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
and parents are not made aware and there
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
also is no follow-up procedure in place
 
04:29:06.530 --> 04:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
and well we did have testimony from DHHS
 
04:29:08.269 --> 04:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
who is also present today
 
04:29:10.189 --> 04:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
and I believe they have the best of
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
intentions and I'd like to think that
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
but the survey itself has no direct
 
04:29:16.670 --> 04:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
benefit to students or teachers because
 
04:29:18.110 --> 04:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have access to the survey
 
04:29:20.510 --> 04:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
results that are Anonymous anyway and
 
04:29:22.490 --> 04:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
there is concern about the accuracy of
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
results when students make a joke of
 
04:29:26.450 --> 04:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
such a survey anyway so it really has no
 
04:29:29.210 --> 04:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
value and it's even noted no academic
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
value so it really shouldn't be in opt
 
04:29:34.010 --> 04:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
out types that it should be opt-in and
 
04:29:34.020 --> 04:29:34.670 align:start position:0%
out types that it should be opt-in and
that's

04:29:34.670 --> 04:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:29:38.090 --> 04:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
just seems fundamental to me
 
04:29:40.429 --> 04:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair a couple of things
 
04:29:45.769 --> 04:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
one it's not only electronic notice in
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
fact what it actually says is written
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
notice sent home with a student and then
 
04:29:53.389 --> 04:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
in addition to the written notice may be
 
04:29:55.550 --> 04:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
provided electronically so the situation
 
04:29:58.370 --> 04:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
that happened with representative
 
04:30:01.849 --> 04:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
Lucas's granddaughter is not what this
 
04:30:03.530 --> 04:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
bill says it's not only electronic you
 
04:30:04.969 --> 04:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
don't have to search a website there is
 
04:30:07.010 --> 04:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
notice set
 
04:30:08.990 --> 04:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
I would just like to speak as a public
 
04:30:12.649 --> 04:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
health person to the incredible value of
 
04:30:16.490 --> 04:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
data to drive decision making about
 
04:30:19.309 --> 04:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
how we educate what we need to know what
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
the problems are
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
and saying that this doesn't have
 
04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
academic benefit does not resonate for
 
04:30:29.330 --> 04:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
me because the situations that the
 
04:30:33.469 --> 04:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
surveys obtain information on relate to
 
04:30:35.389 --> 04:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
an individual's ability to benefit from
 
04:30:39.170 --> 04:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
education you can't learn if your mental
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
health status is not addressed you can't
 
04:30:40.920 --> 04:30:41.990 align:start position:0%
health status is not addressed you can't
learn

04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
learn
 
04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
if a variety of other situations are
 
04:30:45.410 --> 04:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
happening that the data from these
 
04:30:48.170 --> 04:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
surveys help us to be able to address I
 
04:30:49.269 --> 04:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
04:30:53.090 --> 04:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
it's good public policy to get the best
 
04:30:54.710 --> 04:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
survey data we can which would mean the
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
most subjects available thank you yeah
 
04:31:00.830 --> 04:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay we got we got a lot of bills in
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
front of us here and of course we got
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
the youth risk behavior survey it's
 
04:31:07.490 --> 04:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
already in statute and how we do things
 
04:31:11.450 --> 04:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh this is changing that around how much
 
04:31:13.370 --> 04:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
more time we want to spend on commenting
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves here on it is
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
something we ought to consider we got
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
these other bills coming
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
if we
 
04:31:22.010 --> 04:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
want to support this let's just go ahead
 
04:31:23.809 --> 04:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
and show that if we want to be you know
 
04:31:26.090 --> 04:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
just remain with what we got in statute
 
04:31:27.889 --> 04:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
let's go the other way
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
um but let's skip the comment stuff done
 
04:31:32.689 --> 04:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
so we can get you know on with the other
 
04:31:36.889 --> 04:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:40.990 --> 04:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
so we do have a motion on the table
 
04:31:44.330 --> 04:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
to itl this bill
 
04:31:46.250 --> 04:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
but that would mean is we just stay with
 
04:31:47.689 --> 04:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
the Statue we have in the books right
 
04:31:47.699 --> 04:31:48.649 align:start position:0%
the Statue we have in the books right
now

04:31:48.649 --> 04:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:31:50.809 --> 04:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
04:31:52.790 --> 04:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would you know unless
 
04:31:54.290 --> 04:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
there's somebody that really has I don't
 
04:31:55.849 --> 04:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
want to cut it off totally but if
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
somebody has something please let me
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
know right now because I'm ready to call
 
04:32:01.849 --> 04:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
the roll here
 
04:32:05.689 --> 04:32:05.699 align:start position:0%

04:36:12.890 --> 04:36:12.900 align:start position:0%

04:36:25.250 --> 04:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
on 638
 
04:36:27.650 --> 04:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
04:36:30.769 --> 04:36:30.779 align:start position:0%
from Mr representative Miler uh
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
discussion representative land thank you
 
04:36:35.570 --> 04:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
very much uh we've had some discussion
 
04:36:37.490 --> 04:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
on on this extraordinary needs Grant
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
even yesterday I believe we were
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
discussing it
 
04:36:40.680 --> 04:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
discussing it
um

04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think you all know why the the Bill's
 
04:36:45.769 --> 04:36:45.779 align:start position:0%
been put in where for those that
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
received less than fifty thousand
 
04:36:49.250 --> 04:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
dollars there's we're spending more
 
04:36:52.429 --> 04:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
money oftentimes in terms of
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
those that are creating the report then
 
04:36:57.051 --> 04:36:57.061 align:start position:0%
they're receiving from the grant itself
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
and so uh therefore the the putting
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
forward of this particular bill
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
um it's it's just another part of this
 
04:37:09.650 --> 04:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
whole funding formula which we have to
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
address this and the relief Grant and
 
04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity so I won't say
 
04:37:20.230 --> 04:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:23.330 --> 04:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
for the comments representative Tanner
 
04:37:25.730 --> 04:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just would like a little
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
Clarity on this
 
04:37:29.869 --> 04:37:29.879 align:start position:0%
um under section two
 
04:37:32.689 --> 04:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
um a it says the accountability plan
 
04:37:34.670 --> 04:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
will not be a conditional requirement
 
04:37:37.490 --> 04:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
and then down in B it says a school
 
04:37:39.051 --> 04:37:39.061 align:start position:0%
district that shares a town with another
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
school district will result in both
 
04:37:43.010 --> 04:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
districts being required to complete the
 
04:37:45.529 --> 04:37:45.539 align:start position:0%
accountability plan under two
 
04:37:45.539 --> 04:37:46.310 align:start position:0%
accountability plan under two
um

04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:49.631 --> 04:37:49.641 align:start position:0%
so I just it sounds contradictory
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
contradictory to me
 
04:37:54.529 --> 04:37:54.539 align:start position:0%
um could you explain an individual
 
04:37:54.539 --> 04:37:56.390 align:start position:0%
um could you explain an individual
District

04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
District
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
in a that receives this grant
 
04:38:00.480 --> 04:38:01.609 align:start position:0%
in a that receives this grant
um

04:38:01.609 --> 04:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
that's applicable too but if they're in
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
a district that shares a town with
 
04:38:06.119 --> 04:38:08.090 align:start position:0%
a district that shares a town with
another

04:38:08.090 --> 04:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:38:10.849 --> 04:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
with another school district so you're
 
04:38:12.410 --> 04:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
talking about two districts or more
 
04:38:12.420 --> 04:38:13.551 align:start position:0%
talking about two districts or more
there

04:38:13.551 --> 04:38:13.561 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's how I'm reading that uh I
 
04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
thought it was like cooperatives
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
statistics it could be that too and one
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
is required and one isn't to complete
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
the accountability
 
04:38:29.330 --> 04:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
you know it says both are both districts
 
04:38:37.490 --> 04:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.410 --> 04:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
and it says it's
 
04:38:41.570 --> 04:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
the accountability plan will not be a
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
conditional requirement and then in part
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
two it said it's being required to
 
04:38:47.810 --> 04:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
complete the plan
 
04:38:47.820 --> 04:38:52.789 align:start position:0%
complete the plan
so

04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:52.799 --> 04:38:54.410 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:38:54.410 --> 04:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:38:57.170 --> 04:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh if both districts individually are
 
04:38:57.180 --> 04:38:58.730 align:start position:0%
uh if both districts individually are
exempt

04:38:58.730 --> 04:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
but you take the disc Co-op that has
 
04:39:02.929 --> 04:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
them both within that Cooperative
 
04:39:05.689 --> 04:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
District then they wouldn't be exempt
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
right it would total up more than 50
 
04:39:07.439 --> 04:39:08.390 align:start position:0%
right it would total up more than 50
Grand

04:39:08.390 --> 04:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
Grand
 
04:39:10.670 --> 04:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
I I that's how I'm seeing that oh okay
 
04:39:13.551 --> 04:39:13.561 align:start position:0%
this is the cleanup bill from doe it's
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
nothing that we have created it's we've
 
04:39:17.209 --> 04:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
received these type of things and bang
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
we put them Forge this is basically a
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn Bill does this does this grant
 
04:39:24.410 --> 04:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
go to the town or does it go to the
 
04:39:24.420 --> 04:39:26.150 align:start position:0%
go to the town or does it go to the
district

04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:39:27.870 --> 04:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the difference
 
04:39:27.880 --> 04:39:33.250 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the difference
[Music]

04:39:33.250 --> 04:39:33.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.051 --> 04:39:36.061 align:start position:0%
do you think it goes to the town and the
 
04:39:37.368 --> 04:39:37.378 align:start position:0%
money's from the town then are
 
04:39:39.770 --> 04:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
transferred over to the district it goes
 
04:39:41.208 --> 04:39:41.218 align:start position:0%
to the municipal first
 
04:39:43.070 --> 04:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why we had these these
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:57.470 --> 04:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
I I just still see it as uh one
 
04:40:01.070 --> 04:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
contradict contradicting the other
 
04:40:01.080 --> 04:40:05.170 align:start position:0%
contradict contradicting the other
but

04:40:05.170 --> 04:40:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
04:40:10.250 --> 04:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
I just have a question
 
04:40:12.530 --> 04:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
um on what these reports
 
04:40:14.330 --> 04:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
how detailed
 
04:40:16.610 --> 04:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
they have to be
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
I mean we know that a district is 50
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
000 it's because but it could still be a
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
small amount per School approved based
 
04:40:28.010 --> 04:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
on the number of students but do they
 
04:40:30.010 --> 04:40:30.020 align:start position:0%
have to just give a general report
 
04:40:32.448 --> 04:40:32.458 align:start position:0%
overall for the district or does it have
 
04:40:34.250 --> 04:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
to be what they provided for the student
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
that student and that student
 
04:40:40.130 --> 04:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
has to be in accordance with the
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
language which we put in the
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant Bill
 
04:40:48.288 --> 04:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
that Aaron Hennessey put forward last
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
year it stipulates exactly what's the
 
04:40:53.090 --> 04:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
accountability Grant's supposed to I
 
04:40:55.010 --> 04:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
think it's much of the similar language
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
that you would find out of the uh 2018
 
04:40:58.560 --> 04:41:00.470 align:start position:0%
that you would find out of the uh 2018
report

04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
that task force
 
04:41:04.190 --> 04:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
I don't have the extraordinary
 
04:41:07.810 --> 04:41:07.820 align:start position:0%
experience it's um it's
 
04:41:12.490 --> 04:41:12.500 align:start position:0%
19840f Roman 2 on page 758 in your
 
04:41:14.930 --> 04:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
textbook yeah I can get it right here
 
04:41:14.940 --> 04:41:15.948 align:start position:0%
textbook yeah I can get it right here
too

04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:41:18.170 --> 04:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
it says in order to receive an
 
04:41:20.030 --> 04:41:20.040 align:start position:0%

how the district intends to use the
 
04:41:27.650 --> 04:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
grant award funds to improve the
 
04:41:29.750 --> 04:41:29.760 align:start position:0%

04:41:33.948 --> 04:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary need Grant plan shall
 
04:41:35.690 --> 04:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
include an accountability component
 
04:41:37.490 --> 04:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
designed to generate data that measures
 
04:41:39.650 --> 04:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
student academic achievement and growth
 
04:41:41.208 --> 04:41:41.218 align:start position:0%

04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
Etc yes and that was in SB 420 it was
 
04:41:58.368 --> 04:41:58.378 align:start position:0%
submitted on May 17 2020 and it was 2038
 
04:42:00.890 --> 04:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
was the amendment number I got it in
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
front of me right here from our our
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
record last year and it is that it is
 
04:42:10.128 --> 04:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
that language that we have for
 
04:42:12.650 --> 04:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
the these exceptions to filing if it's
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
50 000 or whatever it might be
 
04:42:16.320 --> 04:42:18.530 align:start position:0%
50 000 or whatever it might be
um

04:42:18.530 --> 04:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:22.310 --> 04:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
but it's still it is it still the non
 
04:42:25.730 --> 04:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
it's not a condition of requirement for
 
04:42:28.250 --> 04:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
this grant uh to or for the
 
04:42:31.970 --> 04:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
accountability plan to be received to
 
04:42:35.628 --> 04:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
receive the extraordinary needs Grant
 
04:42:37.850 --> 04:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's what he says yeah
 
04:42:37.860 --> 04:42:42.708 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's what he says yeah
yes

04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%

and the objections to a consent
 
04:44:01.320 --> 04:44:07.010 align:start position:0%
and the objections to a consent
okay

04:44:07.010 --> 04:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:07.020 --> 04:44:09.530 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:44:09.530 --> 04:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:44:11.810 --> 04:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
yeah that was one of the early bills we
 
04:44:15.230 --> 04:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:15.240 --> 04:44:21.708 align:start position:0%
 
Army

04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.830 --> 04:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
people this but but see this was
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
not changing any money at all this was
 
04:44:31.010 --> 04:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
simply changing policy associated with
 
04:44:34.610 --> 04:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.620 --> 04:44:35.810 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:44:35.810 --> 04:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:44:35.820 --> 04:44:38.330 align:start position:0%
it
it does

04:44:38.330 --> 04:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
it does
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
um let me look at that and see if what
 
04:44:44.030 --> 04:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
it was specifically saying FM due to
 
04:44:45.708 --> 04:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
time constraints the office of
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
legislative budgets is unable to provide
 
04:44:49.610 --> 04:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note for this bill
 
04:44:53.090 --> 04:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
as introduced at this time
 
04:44:55.368 --> 04:44:55.378 align:start position:0%
I don't know how this was going to
 
04:44:59.330 --> 04:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
create more money all stipulating as far
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
as whether you have to comply with a
 
04:45:01.560 --> 04:45:02.810 align:start position:0%
as whether you have to comply with a
report

04:45:02.810 --> 04:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:45:02.820 --> 04:45:05.448 align:start position:0%
report
basically

04:45:05.448 --> 04:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:45:07.128 --> 04:45:07.138 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of bills that are coming
 
04:45:08.810 --> 04:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
down without fiscal notes representing
 
04:45:11.810 --> 04:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
Heath and we have a hard time
 
04:45:13.310 --> 04:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
understanding which ones are early
 
04:45:15.288 --> 04:45:15.298 align:start position:0%
versus the other ones which probably
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
should be early and maybe this one
 
04:45:22.430 --> 04:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll put it on our consent and if

um chairman Ladd for a comment
 
04:47:13.610 --> 04:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
um yes uh first thing I'd like to say I
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how we get a a fiscal cost to
 
04:47:18.050 --> 04:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
this thing other than they're saying
 
04:47:20.448 --> 04:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
that in this bill if a student's unable
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
to pay for a meal or what was a meal
 
04:47:28.250 --> 04:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
debt no the the school is prohibited
 
04:47:28.260 --> 04:47:30.170 align:start position:0%
debt no the the school is prohibited
um

04:47:30.170 --> 04:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
and not providing that are requiring
 
04:47:36.288 --> 04:47:36.298 align:start position:0%
something like I guess chores or other
 
04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
work or uh or some way that compensates
 
04:47:43.070 --> 04:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
for the meal
 
04:47:43.080 --> 04:47:44.410 align:start position:0%
for the meal
um

04:47:44.410 --> 04:47:44.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:47.330 --> 04:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
and it says require school to direct
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
communication about child's meal debt to
 
04:47:51.230 --> 04:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
a parent or guardian and not the student
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall prohibit a
 
04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
school from sending a student what I'm
 
04:47:55.850 --> 04:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
trying to say is I don't see any
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
Financial costs do this thing
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
and yet here we are another bill which
 
04:48:06.410 --> 04:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
is an early Bill and with an FN on it
 
04:48:09.230 --> 04:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
um I I for one you know
 
04:48:11.810 --> 04:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
would never do something as a school
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
principal where it's demeaning to any
 
04:48:14.400 --> 04:48:15.590 align:start position:0%
principal where it's demeaning to any
youngster

04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
youngster
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
we expect we used to have kids fighting
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
over helping put the folding tables back
 
04:48:24.410 --> 04:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
back up against the wall or to take a
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
sponge and wash off the surface
 
04:48:27.120 --> 04:48:27.788 align:start position:0%
sponge and wash off the surface
um

04:48:27.788 --> 04:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:30.170 --> 04:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
we never did any cleaning well you know
 
04:48:31.970 --> 04:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
anything like that it was just
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
associated with it it was sometimes it
 
04:48:35.330 --> 04:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
was kids that didn't want to go for
 
04:48:37.970 --> 04:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
recess on that minus 10 day
 
04:48:37.980 --> 04:48:38.628 align:start position:0%
recess on that minus 10 day
um

04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
so um Rick it's not an early build okay
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
FN that the FN yeah that's
 
04:48:49.390 --> 04:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
Duo 316. yeah okay so so
 
04:48:52.368 --> 04:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
that that's my thoughts on this thing I
 
04:48:54.170 --> 04:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
think that this is trying to write a
 
04:48:55.850 --> 04:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
policy for our school district when it's
 
04:48:58.128 --> 04:48:58.138 align:start position:0%
a local Affair and a local can do it the
 
04:48:59.708 --> 04:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
local can
 
04:49:02.628 --> 04:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
knows that the students and can make
 
04:49:04.730 --> 04:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
these decisions without us having to say
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
now we need you know to do it this way I
 
04:49:10.010 --> 04:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
know for a lot of the lunch serving
 
04:49:12.590 --> 04:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
people it's difficult times when you're
 
04:49:14.448 --> 04:49:14.458 align:start position:0%
trying to collect debt at the end of the
 
04:49:17.208 --> 04:49:17.218 align:start position:0%
school year that can be a real hard hard
 
04:49:19.970 --> 04:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
issue and there's some that owe a lot of
 
04:49:19.980 --> 04:49:20.868 align:start position:0%
issue and there's some that owe a lot of
money

04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
and uh that that's that's a burden on
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
school districts I'd rather see
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
something where the school district
 
04:49:29.330 --> 04:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
who's tried to make those efforts they
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
get compensated for that in some way uh
 
04:49:33.050 --> 04:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
if they're not going to get it out of
 
04:49:36.470 --> 04:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
the apparent and perhaps uh somebody
 
04:49:38.448 --> 04:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
that's been here you know in the field
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
recently might be do you ever get
 
04:49:41.690 --> 04:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for something like that I
 
04:49:44.030 --> 04:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't think you do this you absorb that
 
04:49:47.810 --> 04:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
debt so uh that's I I introduced it so
 
04:49:49.550 --> 04:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
that was my little Spiel
 
04:49:53.770 --> 04:49:53.780 align:start position:0%
um representative foreign
 
04:49:56.930 --> 04:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get to thank
 
04:49:56.940 --> 04:49:57.890 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get to thank
you

04:49:57.890 --> 04:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:49:59.448 --> 04:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
um it's it's the Local District that
 
04:50:01.550 --> 04:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
bears the cost if you look at this bill
 
04:50:03.530 --> 04:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
because they're responsible
 
04:50:06.350 --> 04:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year to tap their
 
04:50:09.770 --> 04:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
general fund to pay off the debt
 
04:50:11.990 --> 04:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I can remember as an early or a young
 
04:50:12.000 --> 04:50:13.610 align:start position:0%
um I can remember as an early or a young
principal

04:50:13.610 --> 04:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
principal
 
04:50:15.948 --> 04:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
if somebody didn't pay for their lunch
 
04:50:17.570 --> 04:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
they got a peanut butter and jelly
 
04:50:20.448 --> 04:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
sandwich no that's not discriminating
 
04:50:22.970 --> 04:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
and then the law came out some law came
 
04:50:24.770 --> 04:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
out and said no they get a hot meal like
 
04:50:27.170 --> 04:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
everybody else and nobody knows so thank
 
04:50:28.670 --> 04:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
goodness that did change because
 
04:50:31.670 --> 04:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
obviously that would stigmatize
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know what this law would do as
 
04:50:36.050 --> 04:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
you were saying
 
04:50:38.570 --> 04:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
um because the cost no matter what the
 
04:50:40.490 --> 04:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
debt is and there's a process through
 
04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
the business offices that if there's a
 
04:50:45.050 --> 04:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
high debt then a letter is mailed home
 
04:50:47.770 --> 04:50:47.780 align:start position:0%
from the business office to offer
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
payments plan or and we always threaten
 
04:50:53.628 --> 04:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
small claims court but it's after
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
multiple letters so you've got your data
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
and I think in my 10 years who took one
 
04:51:00.590 --> 04:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
to court we got the money but it was
 
04:51:03.650 --> 04:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
after multiple annual you know going
 
04:51:05.208 --> 04:51:05.218 align:start position:0%
after and it wasn't that the parent
 
04:51:05.218 --> 04:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
after and it wasn't that the parent
couldn't

04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
04:51:09.230 --> 04:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
um it was just you know ignoring the
 
04:51:12.530 --> 04:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
whole situation so I don't know what
 
04:51:15.288 --> 04:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
this bill would do today
 
04:51:18.050 --> 04:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
that isn't already happening
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
which is similar to what you are saying
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's not what I thought initially that
 
04:51:23.510 --> 04:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
did was exactly what I'm currently
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
seeing up in Sao 23 yeah I see them
 
04:51:28.448 --> 04:51:28.458 align:start position:0%
having to go through and when they do go
 
04:51:31.010 --> 04:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's in the real expense in the part of
 
04:51:32.448 --> 04:51:32.458 align:start position:0%
the district so basically they're
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
absorbing this debt and
 
04:51:37.368 --> 04:51:37.378 align:start position:0%
um I think that's the big issue it is
 
04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's the big issue it's it's the kids
 
04:51:43.070 --> 04:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
are being fed the big issue is the debt
 
04:51:45.490 --> 04:51:45.500 align:start position:0%
right that's right we need more money
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
I I think I beg to differ with you Mr
 
04:51:48.718 --> 04:51:49.730 align:start position:0%
I I think I beg to differ with you Mr
chair

04:51:49.730 --> 04:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:51:52.430 --> 04:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is focused on not
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
stigma stigma having a hard time with
 
04:51:59.150 --> 04:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
words here stigmatizing students as a
 
04:51:59.160 --> 04:52:00.110 align:start position:0%
words here stigmatizing students as a
result

04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
result
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
of not paying it I mean we we've we've
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard this problem before
 
04:52:09.410 --> 04:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
and to me it goes Way Beyond who's
 
04:52:11.448 --> 04:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
getting the letter Etc it's it's to
 
04:52:14.270 --> 04:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
making sure that a child
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
does not go through a lunch line and and
 
04:52:21.470 --> 04:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
somehow is stigmatized because it's not
 
04:52:23.930 --> 04:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
being paid I mean I think I think that's
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill unless unless
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm misreading it
 
04:52:31.250 --> 04:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
the the the fact is in the districts
 
04:52:33.170 --> 04:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
I've had the kids are fed and they're
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
fed the same food the the that's that's
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
not the issue I don't think we're
 
04:52:39.830 --> 04:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing the kids I think the issue
 
04:52:42.770 --> 04:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
is we're not reimbursing the schools for
 
04:52:45.050 --> 04:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
the debt that they're incurring and
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
they're putting the schools in a
 
04:52:47.990 --> 04:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
situation where they have to chase this
 
04:52:49.850 --> 04:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
money if they want a receipt and that
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's significant dollars I
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
I was looking at one account which was
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
over a thousand dollars
 
04:52:59.470 --> 04:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's huge
 
04:53:03.770 --> 04:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I just worry that
 
04:53:05.810 --> 04:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
um I know schools have been pressured to
 
04:53:08.448 --> 04:53:08.458 align:start position:0%
to get outside vendors because the you
 
04:53:10.250 --> 04:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
know it's supposed to balance out the
 
04:53:10.260 --> 04:53:11.510 align:start position:0%
know it's supposed to balance out the
the

04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:53:14.208 --> 04:53:14.218 align:start position:0%
income and out uh the expenses uh it's
 
04:53:16.250 --> 04:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
supposed to be independent
 
04:53:19.010 --> 04:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
um that maybe some of these vendors have
 
04:53:20.330 --> 04:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:53:24.650 --> 04:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
gone uh to collection agencies or
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
um pressure tactics that the school
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't approve of but the school may
 
04:53:30.830 --> 04:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
not know about because the
 
04:53:33.770 --> 04:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
the lunch program is is independent of
 
04:53:35.090 --> 04:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
the school
 
04:53:38.090 --> 04:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I visited a couple and they
 
04:53:41.208 --> 04:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
had for their cafeteria they had people
 
04:53:44.208 --> 04:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
come in and actually catering but see
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
part of the promise I see it is that
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
this is not the student that's free and
 
04:53:48.360 --> 04:53:49.788 align:start position:0%
this is not the student that's free and
reduced

04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
04:53:52.010 --> 04:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
this is the student the family has the
 
04:53:52.020 --> 04:53:53.390 align:start position:0%
this is the student the family has the
wherewithal

04:53:53.390 --> 04:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
wherewithal
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
to send the kids without the money
 
04:53:58.128 --> 04:53:58.138 align:start position:0%
and then you're chasing this down
 
04:54:02.150 --> 04:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
and and there's refusal to pay what is
 
04:54:06.490 --> 04:54:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative cascad just to add to
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
that to me if there is somebody that is
 
04:54:13.250 --> 04:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing a student then that's a
 
04:54:15.410 --> 04:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
Personnel issue and it needs to be
 
04:54:15.420 --> 04:54:16.610 align:start position:0%
Personnel issue and it needs to be
addressed

04:54:16.610 --> 04:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
04:54:20.448 --> 04:54:20.458 align:start position:0%
any evaluation process I agree
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you Mr
 
04:54:25.610 --> 04:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
chair just to refer to revenue hoggins
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
uh testimony
 
04:54:29.570 --> 04:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
one of the statements he did say is you
 
04:54:32.090 --> 04:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
could discern was that his concern had
 
04:54:33.770 --> 04:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
been historically that some of the
 
04:54:36.410 --> 04:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
younger youngsters in the cafeteria of
 
04:54:37.690 --> 04:54:37.700 align:start position:0%
the gate in fact
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
and they would give them as they take
 
04:54:41.570 --> 04:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
this home to Mary pick home your mom
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
tonight and give this letter so he can
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
square way of hand and that was his
 
04:54:46.310 --> 04:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
concern you mentioned multiple times
 
04:54:48.288 --> 04:54:48.298 align:start position:0%
over the last two or three years there's
 
04:54:50.208 --> 04:54:50.218 align:start position:0%
a letter that they give the high school
 
04:54:52.250 --> 04:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
kid prosecute them but the elementary
 
04:54:54.170 --> 04:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
school is way in line take this home of
 
04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
your mother because she needs she shows
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
us you know take care of it and I think
 
04:54:58.670 --> 04:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
that was a concern he was thinking about
 
04:54:59.448 --> 04:54:59.458 align:start position:0%
when he started talking about
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
stigmatization particularly and and they
 
04:55:04.490 --> 04:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
thought that would be initially how it
 
04:55:06.708 --> 04:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
may happen yeah however there is
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up from the food service director
 
04:55:10.490 --> 04:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
or the person sure that is done
 
04:55:12.708 --> 04:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
oftentimes up by phone is done by
 
04:55:14.030 --> 04:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
internet internet but that's why he
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
wrote that in the in the bill with the
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
chair that they can't send it home by
 
04:55:19.250 --> 04:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
the student that was the point that's
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
all I just recalling that directly thank
 
04:55:24.890 --> 04:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
you represent Belcher
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
um but the way I see it most of this
 
04:55:30.890 --> 04:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
bill is is reasonably unobjectionable
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to call people's attention
 
04:55:35.208 --> 04:55:35.218 align:start position:0%
beginning at line 12 and if you follow
 
04:55:36.410 --> 04:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
along with me for a second I want to
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that this is not
 
04:55:40.010 --> 04:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
particularly well worded any school that
 
04:55:41.270 --> 04:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
participates in the national school
 
04:55:42.650 --> 04:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
lunch breakfast program or national
 
04:55:45.050 --> 04:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
school lunch program shall not provide
 
04:55:47.270 --> 04:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
to any child who qualifies for a free
 
04:55:49.250 --> 04:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
reduced breakfast or lunch an alternate
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
meal that is not provided to students
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
generally what is provided to students
 
04:55:56.690 --> 04:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
generally a lot of schools have their
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
cafeteria they also have vendors that
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
come in I would argue and I think a lot
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
of other people might argue that the
 
04:56:03.410 --> 04:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
vendors coming in are generally
 
04:56:05.810 --> 04:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
providing food we're opening up a
 
04:56:07.250 --> 04:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
situation because of the way this is
 
04:56:10.010 --> 04:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
awarded after line 10 here that free and
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
reduced launch students could be
 
04:56:13.850 --> 04:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
demanding whatever vendored food at
 
04:56:16.010 --> 04:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
whatever cost and that could be
 
04:56:17.448 --> 04:56:17.458 align:start position:0%
something that winds up being billed to
 
04:56:18.890 --> 04:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
the school having to be covered by the
 
04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
school that would have that language to
 
04:56:22.128 --> 04:56:22.138 align:start position:0%
me would have to be cleaned up
 
04:56:22.138 --> 04:56:23.270 align:start position:0%
me would have to be cleaned up
considerably

04:56:23.270 --> 04:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
considerably
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
represent dry you at here and yes thank
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
04:56:31.490 --> 04:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you mentioned about
 
04:56:33.770 --> 04:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
possibilities about how this might be
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
enacted because in this year's testimony
 
04:56:39.650 --> 04:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
when we asked the sponsor
 
04:56:41.208 --> 04:56:41.218 align:start position:0%
is this happening is this a current
 
04:56:44.448 --> 04:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
issue he only talked about conjecture on
 
04:56:46.910 --> 04:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
how it might happen and I didn't hear
 
04:56:49.970 --> 04:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
any it's happening here today one he may
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
have said it in other years but he
 
04:56:54.830 --> 04:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:57.050 --> 04:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and that that goes on to what
 
04:57:00.010 --> 04:57:00.020 align:start position:0%
I was trying to convey I am really
 
04:57:05.628 --> 04:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
tired of hearing that schools
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
are doing something which is not good
 
04:57:10.010 --> 04:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
for kids or that they're they're
 
04:57:12.590 --> 04:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
insinuate are there's insinuation the
 
04:57:14.570 --> 04:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
schools are mistreating so I don't
 
04:57:17.208 --> 04:57:17.218 align:start position:0%
believe that the case I think teachers
 
04:57:20.510 --> 04:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
and food service people are in there you
 
04:57:22.070 --> 04:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in that business to make
 
04:57:25.850 --> 04:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
money you're there to help kids and I
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
think that's the genuine place that all
 
04:57:31.490 --> 04:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
these people are at and for us to even
 
04:57:34.550 --> 04:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
insinuate that you know their kids are
 
04:57:37.490 --> 04:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
being uh intentionally stigmatized by
 
04:57:40.250 --> 04:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
not providing a meal the best I'd like
 
04:57:41.330 --> 04:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
to know where that's happening because
 
04:57:43.550 --> 04:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
if that is I agree with representative
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
Cascada that's a Personnel issue
 
04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
and somebody has to get on top of that
 
04:57:51.948 --> 04:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
and say goodbye to that person
 
04:57:51.958 --> 04:57:52.490 align:start position:0%
and say goodbye to that person
um

04:57:52.490 --> 04:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
you know the the the the person is doing
 
04:57:57.770 --> 04:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
that because that is not where we are as
 
04:58:00.890 --> 04:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
a society today and I I'm sorry I just
 
04:58:03.170 --> 04:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
can't believe that
 
04:58:04.788 --> 04:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
our school districts are doing that
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
represent Balboni uh just a little
 
04:58:09.410 --> 04:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
commentary my sister-in-law is a food
 
04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
service director and I asked her to kind
 
04:58:13.010 --> 04:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
of look at this and give me an idea of
 
04:58:14.448 --> 04:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
whether or not these practices are
 
04:58:16.250 --> 04:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
occurring in the district because she
 
04:58:18.890 --> 04:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
works in and she's pretty strict about
 
04:58:20.810 --> 04:58:20.820 align:start position:0%
what's allowed and what's not allowed
 
04:58:23.570 --> 04:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
and she felt that it was a local school
 
04:58:26.030 --> 04:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
issue and it wasn't
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
um prevalent in in her district and
 
04:58:32.868 --> 04:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
again her bigger problem was uh dealing
 
04:58:35.330 --> 04:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
with the the
 
04:58:38.090 --> 04:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
parents who don't pay at the end and
 
04:58:40.250 --> 04:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
most school districts absorb the cost at
 
04:58:42.650 --> 04:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
the end can be significant and we never
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
treated Food Service as a money-making
 
04:58:46.080 --> 04:58:47.270 align:start position:0%
treated Food Service as a money-making
venture

04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
venture
 
04:58:50.448 --> 04:58:50.458 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you
 
04:58:52.850 --> 04:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
represent parano I just tried to check
 
04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
my email I don't think I've received
 
04:58:56.208 --> 04:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
anything from any constituents or
 
04:58:58.128 --> 04:58:58.138 align:start position:0%
anybody in the state on this bill and
 
04:58:59.810 --> 04:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering I can't remember how to
 
04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
find the online testimony have and you
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
are all usually good at that Mr chair
 
04:59:07.368 --> 04:59:07.378 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'll just do a little Maya
 
04:59:09.770 --> 04:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
culpa two years ago this committee saw
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
this same bill
 
04:59:13.610 --> 04:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
followed by a prime sponsor and
 
04:59:16.910 --> 04:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored by Mullen Miler and luno it
 
04:59:20.510 --> 04:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
left this committee itl 20 to nothing
 
04:59:23.690 --> 04:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
um and I'm inclined to uh to do that
 
04:59:25.730 --> 04:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
this year too
 
04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:31.570 --> 04:59:31.580 align:start position:0%
if that's uh
 
04:59:35.628 --> 04:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
people can do whatever they want yeah
 
04:59:35.638 --> 04:59:38.868 align:start position:0%
people can do whatever they want yeah
representative

04:59:38.868 --> 04:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
um just a final to uh address line 12 13
 
04:59:41.760 --> 04:59:43.788 align:start position:0%
um just a final to uh address line 12 13
14.

04:59:43.788 --> 04:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
14.
 
04:59:43.798 --> 04:59:44.750 align:start position:0%
14.
um

04:59:44.750 --> 04:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:47.330 --> 04:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
the food service has to offer a certain
 
04:59:47.340 --> 04:59:48.830 align:start position:0%
the food service has to offer a certain
meal

04:59:48.830 --> 04:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
meal
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
and from my experience what they call
 
04:59:53.510 --> 04:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
like the Well when the wellness policy
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
came out you had to remove all vending
 
04:59:56.690 --> 04:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
machines you couldn't have any more soda
 
04:59:58.610 --> 04:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
and snacks all of that
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
which was bad
 
05:00:00.480 --> 05:00:01.550 align:start position:0%
which was bad
um

05:00:01.550 --> 05:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
some I guess but I don't know if you're
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
thinking of there are alternatives kids
 
05:00:09.890 --> 05:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
can buy and those are a la carte items
 
05:00:13.730 --> 05:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
so there might be packaged snacks I
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
don't think there's Devil Dogs not
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be and you know healthy
 
05:00:20.890 --> 05:00:20.900 align:start position:0%
snacks from a vendor or vending company
 
05:00:23.570 --> 05:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
which kids sometimes can just buy if
 
05:00:25.010 --> 05:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
they bring the money but it's totally
 
05:00:27.288 --> 05:00:27.298 align:start position:0%
separate from the hot lunch program kids
 
05:00:29.690 --> 05:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
who have a debt have a right to the free
 
05:00:33.770 --> 05:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
hot lunch but not to the you know the a
 
05:00:36.288 --> 05:00:36.298 align:start position:0%
la carte stuff unless they got cash and
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
they're paying it on cash so I don't
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
know if that's that's what you were
 
05:00:39.660 --> 05:00:43.270 align:start position:0%
know if that's that's what you were
thinking

05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:45.770 --> 05:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:00:47.570 --> 05:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of Stories on soda
 
05:00:49.490 --> 05:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
machines we used to call them pop
 
05:00:51.230 --> 05:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
machines where I was in my pop machine
 
05:00:52.850 --> 05:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
before all the rules came down and got
 
05:00:54.530 --> 05:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
me eighteen thousand dollars annually
 
05:00:57.470 --> 05:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
for the slush fund and then in Texas
 
05:00:59.628 --> 05:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
where my daughter worked she couldn't
 
05:01:01.490 --> 05:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
bring a Pepsi to school because they had
 
05:01:03.410 --> 05:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
a contract with Coke you're right
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
exactly and that's that's that's where
 
05:01:06.890 --> 05:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
we've gone with this some of this stuff
 
05:01:09.110 --> 05:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
Money Maker though it's a money it's a
 
05:01:11.090 --> 05:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
big money maker but it's not really the
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
way to go it's not really nutritious
 
05:01:17.948 --> 05:01:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
we got the scoreboards too yes okay so
 
05:01:24.350 --> 05:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
no more discussion on this we have a
 
05:01:27.770 --> 05:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
motion of floor to itl this bill
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%

so
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
great thank you uh the uh by the way I
 
05:02:34.128 --> 05:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll do 654 today that's
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
the last one that was the bill we heard
 
05:02:37.310 --> 05:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
first today and we had some questions
 
05:02:40.190 --> 05:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
about monitoring and all that we may
 
05:02:41.930 --> 05:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
want to you know
 
05:02:43.490 --> 05:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
unless there's somebody would like to
 
05:02:45.410 --> 05:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
move forward with it uh today I don't
 
05:02:45.420 --> 05:02:46.310 align:start position:0%
move forward with it uh today I don't
know

05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:02:50.090 --> 05:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
we're no Russian right
 
05:02:52.610 --> 05:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
we can take it up very shortly here you
 
05:02:55.250 --> 05:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
know in the next you know a couple weeks
 
05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
but okay 429 is the remaining bill for
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
today then oh wait wait a minute oh 170.
 
05:03:05.150 --> 05:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
let's climb back up to 170 HP 170
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
requiring the teaching of cursive
 
05:03:11.208 --> 05:03:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.090 --> 05:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative leicus
 
05:03:18.890 --> 05:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.448 --> 05:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
05:03:24.770 --> 05:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
second represent four seconds the motion
 
05:03:28.190 --> 05:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:29.930 --> 05:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
did you have an amendment
 
05:03:32.208 --> 05:03:32.218 align:start position:0%
yeah but I if you made the motion are
 
05:03:36.770 --> 05:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:39.770 --> 05:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh on the bill okay yeah
 
05:03:39.780 --> 05:03:40.550 align:start position:0%
uh on the bill okay yeah
um

05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
first regarding cursive we heard a lot
 
05:03:46.128 --> 05:03:46.138 align:start position:0%
of testimony about how important that
 
05:03:48.050 --> 05:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
was for brain development and
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
particularly kids with dyslexia and how
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
that helped them
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
um and then it's regards to math we keep
 
05:03:58.610 --> 05:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
hearing there's a big drop off in how
 
05:04:01.250 --> 05:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
kids do after a certain
 
05:04:03.530 --> 05:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
time period hit
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
suddenly we have a big drop off and as a
 
05:04:09.288 --> 05:04:09.298 align:start position:0%
math teacher that's when you really get
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
into having to do facts fractions
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
reducing fractions factoring all that
 
05:04:17.390 --> 05:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff and that requires a good
 
05:04:20.288 --> 05:04:20.298 align:start position:0%
knowledge memorization of those
 
05:04:22.730 --> 05:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables and without them
 
05:04:26.690 --> 05:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's a struggle and so if we're not
 
05:04:29.448 --> 05:04:29.458 align:start position:0%
requiring them to be taught
 
05:04:32.690 --> 05:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
and then suddenly you get to the math
 
05:04:35.690 --> 05:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
skills that require those things you're
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
going to have a real drop off in in how
 
05:04:40.368 --> 05:04:40.378 align:start position:0%
kids are doing and so I think we're
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
really hurting kids by not requiring
 
05:04:46.010 --> 05:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
them yes they have calculators but
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of math that you do that
 
05:04:51.050 --> 05:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh trying to use a calculator and not
 
05:04:52.850 --> 05:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
just knowing it is going to take a long
 
05:04:56.690 --> 05:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:59.570 --> 05:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the second
 
05:05:03.650 --> 05:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I think that
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
students lose a lot in terms of
 
05:05:09.410 --> 05:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
manual dexterity and things like that
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
which they then later need in doing
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:05:17.090 --> 05:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
I think students lose a lot in not
 
05:05:20.448 --> 05:05:20.458 align:start position:0%
learning cursing and for that matter uh
 
05:05:23.448 --> 05:05:23.458 align:start position:0%
multiplication uh they simply aren't
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
prepared to do a lot of the things
 
05:05:27.770 --> 05:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
they're later very hard to do simply
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
filling out an application for a job or
 
05:05:32.690 --> 05:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
for a driver's license or things like
 
05:05:35.330 --> 05:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
that and just understanding what other
 
05:05:37.730 --> 05:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
people have written whether or not they
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
themselves can do it it's important that
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
they know what it means and I think it's
 
05:05:44.448 --> 05:05:44.458 align:start position:0%
a loss if we leave it out of school
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:49.440 --> 05:05:50.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:05:50.810 --> 05:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:50.820 --> 05:05:54.708 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you just hold on that
 
05:05:58.970 --> 05:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:02.390 --> 05:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes represent I I wanted to Echo what
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative Ford said one of the
 
05:06:06.590 --> 05:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
things he said about being able to read
 
05:06:09.170 --> 05:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
cursive so
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a former instructor where I graded a
 
05:06:16.730 --> 05:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
lot of papers I myself uh
 
05:06:19.490 --> 05:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
right would write comments it was the
 
05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
comfortable way for me to think was to
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
have a paper a
 
05:06:26.690 --> 05:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
a paper and write my comments
 
05:06:28.730 --> 05:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
um not that I didn't know how to use the
 
05:06:30.650 --> 05:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
you know doing it electronically I just
 
05:06:33.288 --> 05:06:33.298 align:start position:0%
think differently and I write in cursive
 
05:06:35.868 --> 05:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
because that would help me think a
 
05:06:37.128 --> 05:06:37.138 align:start position:0%
certain way what I'm saying is you
 
05:06:40.010 --> 05:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
students are going to be coming across
 
05:06:41.330 --> 05:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
that where
 
05:06:41.340 --> 05:06:42.948 align:start position:0%
that where
um

05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:44.990 --> 05:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
they'll need to read not just students
 
05:06:46.730 --> 05:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
it seems to me almost like another form
 
05:06:49.010 --> 05:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
of illiteracy to be unable to read
 
05:06:50.510 --> 05:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
cursive and I'm not just talking about
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
reading the Constitution the original
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
documents of the founding fathers I mean
 
05:06:57.890 --> 05:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah that's great but you do
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
come across cursive so whether or not
 
05:07:00.770 --> 05:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
you even
 
05:07:03.590 --> 05:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
right in cursive which you know I think
 
05:07:05.090 --> 05:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
the process of learning cursive from
 
05:07:06.650 --> 05:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
what we've seen we've seen lots of
 
05:07:08.930 --> 05:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
evidence that you
 
05:07:11.090 --> 05:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
writing a cursive is good for you know
 
05:07:13.550 --> 05:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
dyslexia but just in general I I firmly
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
believe it's similar to something that
 
05:07:17.208 --> 05:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
happens when you do music lessons you
 
05:07:18.948 --> 05:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
know I don't have my kids become you
 
05:07:20.690 --> 05:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
know I didn't expect for them to start
 
05:07:23.150 --> 05:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
playing an instrument in a Orchestra
 
05:07:25.070 --> 05:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
professionally but I certainly had them
 
05:07:26.810 --> 05:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
all do music lessons because I think
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's good for the brain from what I've
 
05:07:32.030 --> 05:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
read learning to write in cursive is
 
05:07:34.628 --> 05:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
good for the brain and I was half joking
 
05:07:37.368 --> 05:07:37.378 align:start position:0%
uh the other day
 
05:07:39.890 --> 05:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
05:07:46.368 --> 05:07:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:48.128 --> 05:07:48.138 align:start position:0%
the instruction
 
05:07:52.128 --> 05:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
in uh I think Community College this
 
05:07:53.690 --> 05:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
kind of gets to the multiplication table
 
05:07:55.610 --> 05:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
part of this bill
 
05:07:58.070 --> 05:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I was half joking thinking well
 
05:07:59.690 --> 05:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
maybe we wouldn't have the problem of
 
05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
needing remedial instruction in math and
 
05:08:04.730 --> 05:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
Community College if we covered the
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
basics in grade school of memorizing the
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:11.760 --> 05:08:15.010 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:08:15.010 --> 05:08:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:18.590 --> 05:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
grab somewhere thanks very much Mr chair
 
05:08:21.830 --> 05:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and um I mean I think you you
 
05:08:24.288 --> 05:08:24.298 align:start position:0%
probably know how a lot of a lot of a
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
lot of us feel about
 
05:08:29.690 --> 05:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
telling school districts what to uh what
 
05:08:31.128 --> 05:08:31.138 align:start position:0%
to teach
 
05:08:35.030 --> 05:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
um but um but in in this case
 
05:08:35.040 --> 05:08:35.628 align:start position:0%
um but um but in in this case
um

05:08:35.628 --> 05:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:38.330 --> 05:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
you know especially you know when we're
 
05:08:41.570 --> 05:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
talking fifth grade or below fifth grade
 
05:08:43.368 --> 05:08:43.378 align:start position:0%
um you know when when when you don't
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
have you know you don't have students
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
sitting in study halls and stuff like
 
05:08:51.890 --> 05:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
that this is um is coming in and you
 
05:08:53.890 --> 05:08:53.900 align:start position:0%
know displacing something that's already
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
being taught so I think that's a concern
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
but I think ultimately though
 
05:09:00.480 --> 05:09:01.368 align:start position:0%
but I think ultimately though
um

05:09:01.368 --> 05:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
is this is this a um a 28a
 
05:09:08.690 --> 05:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
violation you know unfunded mandate
 
05:09:10.368 --> 05:09:10.378 align:start position:0%
we're telling him to do something and
 
05:09:12.050 --> 05:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
not paying for it there's no
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation with this bill
 
05:09:14.520 --> 05:09:17.150 align:start position:0%
appropriation with this bill
um

05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:20.510 --> 05:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
another question question to you on on I
 
05:09:22.250 --> 05:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
would say no
 
05:09:22.260 --> 05:09:24.368 align:start position:0%
would say no
um

05:09:24.368 --> 05:09:24.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
teaching cursive has been taught for
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
years in schools and to say that we're
 
05:09:31.128 --> 05:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
going to now have to put more money in
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
the budget so we can teach cursive uh
 
05:09:35.690 --> 05:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
where you may have to put it as into the
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
heist of the higher education system so
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's taught the people are going to be
 
05:09:40.920 --> 05:09:42.410 align:start position:0%
it's taught the people are going to be
teachers

05:09:42.410 --> 05:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
05:09:42.420 --> 05:09:44.330 align:start position:0%
teachers
um

05:09:44.330 --> 05:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
I see it as a component of language arts
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
it can be taught to students during when
 
05:09:55.610 --> 05:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
you it is is spelling taught yes
 
05:09:59.150 --> 05:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
spelling should be taught in school and
 
05:10:00.770 --> 05:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
um McGraw-Hill used to have a wonderful
 
05:10:02.448 --> 05:10:02.458 align:start position:0%
program with with the spelling and the
 
05:10:04.090 --> 05:10:04.100 align:start position:0%
handwriting mixed together
 
05:10:06.530 --> 05:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
you could see it you know in your new
 
05:10:10.970 --> 05:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
words we're done in cursive uh I don't
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
believe that you're going to have to
 
05:10:15.530 --> 05:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
have it's a 91a issue uh in an
 
05:10:18.170 --> 05:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
elementary school the classroom teacher
 
05:10:19.970 --> 05:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
is certainly qualified to be teach
 
05:10:22.610 --> 05:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
handwriting you know I didn't say it was
 
05:10:26.708 --> 05:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:29.830 --> 05:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
28 days 28 days I'm talking about this
 
05:10:31.910 --> 05:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
confidentiality going in a closed
 
05:10:33.650 --> 05:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
session I'm sorry
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
getting in the other day but no I don't
 
05:10:38.570 --> 05:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
think it is I'll just say no and I don't
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
think it is a 28-day issue
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
um in in the second part multiplication
 
05:10:47.150 --> 05:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
tables those are are inclusive in the
 
05:10:49.610 --> 05:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
the mathematics program right now
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
um whether they're taught to be
 
05:10:52.670 --> 05:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
memorized or not
 
05:10:54.890 --> 05:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
um it's just like how many people have
 
05:10:56.448 --> 05:10:56.458 align:start position:0%
ever been in a spelling bee how many
 
05:10:58.010 --> 05:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
people have ever been in the forensics
 
05:11:00.830 --> 05:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
contest uh all those types of things you
 
05:11:02.930 --> 05:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
do in schools
 
05:11:05.390 --> 05:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
um you know that that's not doesn't take
 
05:11:08.690 --> 05:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
a 28a to do that if geography be you
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
know you just you know it's taught
 
05:11:12.110 --> 05:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
through the class of the homeroom
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
teacher because they're doing
 
05:11:17.090 --> 05:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
but they're doing it now if Okay then if
 
05:11:19.550 --> 05:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
they're not doing this then it's about
 
05:11:21.830 --> 05:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
time they started doing this and
 
05:11:24.708 --> 05:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
teaching the times tables or or having
 
05:11:26.750 --> 05:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
kids memorize them and I understand all
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
kids won't and that's why you see part C
 
05:11:31.550 --> 05:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
in this where you know or you will see
 
05:11:33.470 --> 05:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
it in in terms of the amendment that I'm
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to introduce here and I haven't
 
05:11:36.530 --> 05:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to put that forth
 
05:11:38.750 --> 05:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
where you need to have an opportunity
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
for you know those that have a you know
 
05:11:44.690 --> 05:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
an IEP or a 504 plan or some reason
 
05:11:46.970 --> 05:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
where they it's waived to the fact that
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
that's you know
 
05:11:52.550 --> 05:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
not modified or account accommodated in
 
05:11:54.288 --> 05:11:54.298 align:start position:0%
in those plans so
 
05:11:57.288 --> 05:11:57.298 align:start position:0%
oh it's done so
 
05:11:59.628 --> 05:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
at this point in time I like I would
 
05:12:03.530 --> 05:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
like to offer uh this amendment and
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's zero two three three h
 
05:12:09.530 --> 05:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
and you should assume excuse me that's
 
05:12:10.730 --> 05:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
the old one
 
05:12:10.740 --> 05:12:11.628 align:start position:0%
the old one
um

05:12:11.628 --> 05:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:16.670 --> 05:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:20.270 --> 05:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
and and what it does it says each Public
 
05:12:21.890 --> 05:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
School District and Charter Public
 
05:12:24.050 --> 05:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
Schools shall provide instruction in
 
05:12:25.490 --> 05:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
cursive writing
 
05:12:27.770 --> 05:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
by the end of fifth grade as a component
 
05:12:30.890 --> 05:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
of the English language arts and provide

the instructions multiplication tables
 
05:12:34.490 --> 05:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
by the end of the fifth grade
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%

yes

05:12:47.208 --> 05:12:47.218 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:12:49.250 --> 05:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
could cursive be taught as a second
 
05:12:49.260 --> 05:12:51.650 align:start position:0%
could cursive be taught as a second
language

05:12:51.650 --> 05:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:12:53.930 --> 05:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
occurs would be taught as a second
 
05:12:55.850 --> 05:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
language in other words get money for
 
05:12:58.850 --> 05:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
that but also aren't we aren't we
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
prescribing curriculum here and and
 
05:13:05.150 --> 05:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
pedagogy and that's a local local issue
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
I mean it's I it's not that I don't
 
05:13:09.650 --> 05:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
think I mean I know cursive and I know
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
multiplication and you know I memorized
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
them in school and I think that's great
 
05:13:14.638 --> 05:13:15.770 align:start position:0%
them in school and I think that's great
but

05:13:15.770 --> 05:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:13:18.708 --> 05:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a local issue well I I'd
 
05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
respond that of the states that just
 
05:13:22.368 --> 05:13:22.378 align:start position:0%
recently put this in effect
 
05:13:24.530 --> 05:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is one our neighbors doing
 
05:13:27.650 --> 05:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
it now that's in law down there along
 
05:13:30.110 --> 05:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
with Alabama Arizona Arkansas Delaware
 
05:13:31.788 --> 05:13:31.798 align:start position:0%

Ohio Oklahoma South Carolina Tennessee
 
05:13:40.490 --> 05:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
Texas Virginia and West Virginia all are
 
05:13:44.090 --> 05:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:46.070 --> 05:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
I share uh representative Tanner's
 
05:13:51.670 --> 05:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
concern but more importantly the the
 
05:13:53.750 --> 05:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
department that's currently going
 
05:13:56.750 --> 05:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
through changes in their standards
 
05:13:59.810 --> 05:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
bo6 is currently being reviewed
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
and these are the things that basically
 
05:14:04.490 --> 05:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
outline to the school district in those
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
standards what needs to be done
 
05:14:06.240 --> 05:14:08.208 align:start position:0%
standards what needs to be done
academically

05:14:08.208 --> 05:14:08.218 align:start position:0%
academically
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
and so I don't know why the legislature
 
05:14:13.610 --> 05:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
has to take on the responsibility
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
of doing this when in fact the
 
05:14:19.910 --> 05:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
department for the last two years have
 
05:14:22.430 --> 05:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
been working on standards for schools
 
05:14:24.590 --> 05:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
and this clearly is a standard for for
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
schools I mean there's no question you
 
05:14:28.730 --> 05:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
know we want students to be able to do
 
05:14:30.590 --> 05:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
their multiplication tables now there's
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
no question about that it's whereas the
 
05:14:36.590 --> 05:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
Aegis of the direction and to me it's in
 
05:14:39.050 --> 05:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
those standards that are issued by the
 
05:14:41.810 --> 05:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
department not not here
 
05:14:44.330 --> 05:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli yeah thank you I
 
05:14:46.128 --> 05:14:46.138 align:start position:0%
think that's right I think those 306
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
standards and we haven't even seen a
 
05:14:48.240 --> 05:14:49.190 align:start position:0%
standards and we haven't even seen a
draft

05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
draft
 
05:14:50.570 --> 05:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
um it hasn't gone to the State Board of
 
05:14:54.530 --> 05:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
Education to not pass legislation
 
05:14:57.770 --> 05:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
um waiting for something that might or
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
might not pass the State Board of
 
05:15:00.480 --> 05:15:01.730 align:start position:0%
might not pass the State Board of
Education

05:15:01.730 --> 05:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
Education
 
05:15:04.970 --> 05:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
um I think is not a wise move on our
 
05:15:04.980 --> 05:15:06.050 align:start position:0%
um I think is not a wise move on our
part

05:15:06.050 --> 05:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
part
 
05:15:06.060 --> 05:15:08.570 align:start position:0%
part
ner

05:15:08.570 --> 05:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
ner
 
05:15:10.010 --> 05:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
just to respond to representative
 
05:15:13.610 --> 05:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
cordelli I'm not a curriculum specialist
 
05:15:17.090 --> 05:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't I'm not I don't teach
 
05:15:17.100 --> 05:15:17.930 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't I'm not I don't teach
this

05:15:17.930 --> 05:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:15:20.990 --> 05:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
the people who are creating the 306
 
05:15:23.930 --> 05:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
standards are experts in the field
 
05:15:26.030 --> 05:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
they are people who work in the schools
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
they know what the curriculum is I don't
 
05:15:30.590 --> 05:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
know what the curriculum is
 
05:15:32.810 --> 05:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not a specialist and I that's why
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just hesitate I'm trying to
 
05:15:38.208 --> 05:15:38.218 align:start position:0%
hesitate us to move forward and you're
 
05:15:40.430 --> 05:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct the standards
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
are currently being reviewed by various
 
05:15:45.050 --> 05:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
groups Etc the state the uh state board
 
05:15:48.050 --> 05:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
of education is gonna soon I think this
 
05:15:49.970 --> 05:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
month gonna see at least the draft of
 
05:15:49.980 --> 05:15:50.750 align:start position:0%
month gonna see at least the draft of
them

05:15:50.750 --> 05:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:15:52.550 --> 05:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
it would seem to music after next month
 
05:15:55.310 --> 05:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
or the next month well no I I understand
 
05:15:57.470 --> 05:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding is supposed to be it's
 
05:15:59.690 --> 05:15:59.700 align:start position:0%
ready Friday yeah so but anyway that's
 
05:16:01.368 --> 05:16:01.378 align:start position:0%
that's my concern I'm not the expert
 
05:16:03.530 --> 05:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
here and I'd rather leave it to those
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
who work in the schools to basically be
 
05:16:07.250 --> 05:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for doing that
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cascade
 
05:16:12.170 --> 05:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
you say that with a smirk I just you
 
05:16:14.090 --> 05:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
know a number of public schools stands
 
05:16:16.128 --> 05:16:16.138 align:start position:0%
306 and then you look at the academic
 
05:16:17.390 --> 05:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
standards too which are two different
 
05:16:20.090 --> 05:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
beasts right
 
05:16:20.100 --> 05:16:20.868 align:start position:0%
beasts right
um

05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
I would not I don't think it's the
 
05:16:26.030 --> 05:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
legislative's place to be
 
05:16:28.190 --> 05:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
adding laws on instruction and
 
05:16:31.368 --> 05:16:31.378 align:start position:0%
curriculum that's my first take I I
 
05:16:34.430 --> 05:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
think that cursive handwriting should
 
05:16:36.708 --> 05:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely part be part of minimum
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
standards and language arts curriculum
 
05:16:41.570 --> 05:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
because cursive helps students with
 
05:16:43.368 --> 05:16:43.378 align:start position:0%
dyslexia because they don't have to pick
 
05:16:45.170 --> 05:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
up the pencil and form their letters
 
05:16:47.810 --> 05:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
they can flow used to be a second grade
 
05:16:47.820 --> 05:16:48.890 align:start position:0%
they can flow used to be a second grade
skill

05:16:48.890 --> 05:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
skill
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
it helps with reading fluency and
 
05:16:53.990 --> 05:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
written composition so there is you know
 
05:16:55.490 --> 05:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
scientific data that curse of
 
05:16:57.770 --> 05:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
handwriting has
 
05:16:57.780 --> 05:16:58.368 align:start position:0%
handwriting has
um

05:16:58.368 --> 05:16:58.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:00.650 --> 05:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
you know value for sure and I I
 
05:17:02.690 --> 05:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
definitely am disappointed that it's not
 
05:17:04.850 --> 05:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
being taught my nine-year-old's grandson
 
05:17:07.128 --> 05:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
I bought him the polymer handwriting
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
book because he's not learning cursive
 
05:17:11.868 --> 05:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
same for multiplication tables
 
05:17:13.850 --> 05:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
when that was done in fourth and fifth
 
05:17:17.628 --> 05:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
grade it helps to develop the brain in
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
being able to do rapid
 
05:17:21.890 --> 05:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
thought process
 
05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't belong here and I don't
 
05:17:25.310 --> 05:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
think that's the root cause of the
 
05:17:25.320 --> 05:17:27.708 align:start position:0%
think that's the root cause of the
problem

05:17:27.708 --> 05:17:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:30.410 --> 05:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
um I had the national Jamie vulner chart
 
05:17:33.050 --> 05:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
that some somebody that testified in a
 
05:17:37.128 --> 05:17:37.138 align:start position:0%
hearing since 2000 nationally we have
 
05:17:40.550 --> 05:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
added 42 additional teaching tasks to
 
05:17:40.560 --> 05:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
added 42 additional teaching tasks to
people

05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:17:44.930 --> 05:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
now you tell me has there been a law to
 
05:17:47.208 --> 05:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
extend the school day because what
 
05:17:50.270 --> 05:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
teachers have found is when we became
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
one-on-one you know technology that had
 
05:17:55.128 --> 05:17:55.138 align:start position:0%
to start teaching keyboarding in first
 
05:17:57.050 --> 05:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
second third grade because by fourth
 
05:17:57.060 --> 05:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
second third grade because by fourth
grade

05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
grade
 
05:17:59.750 --> 05:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
or even third grade some of their work
 
05:18:01.970 --> 05:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
is all in word doc so they have to learn
 
05:18:03.830 --> 05:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
those typing skills
 
05:18:06.410 --> 05:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
but nothing was taken away from the
 
05:18:09.288 --> 05:18:09.298 align:start position:0%
length of no time was added it was just
 
05:18:12.770 --> 05:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
do it and so I'm suspecting that cursive
 
05:18:15.410 --> 05:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
went on a back burner because they had
 
05:18:18.010 --> 05:18:18.020 align:start position:0%
to do so many other things
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
plus instruction belongs with the
 
05:18:24.170 --> 05:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
professionals it doesn't belong here
 
05:18:27.050 --> 05:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
but it it should be in our Public
 
05:18:29.690 --> 05:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
Schools I I don't disagree with that but
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's not our job to decide what
 
05:18:34.610 --> 05:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
curriculum occurs at the local level
 
05:18:38.208 --> 05:18:38.218 align:start position:0%
but again it's my biggest thing is is
 
05:18:40.128 --> 05:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
the time factor and that's why it
 
05:18:42.170 --> 05:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen okay
 
05:18:44.090 --> 05:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Geo I just like to
 
05:18:47.868 --> 05:18:47.878 align:start position:0%
highlight what I what I see is a a few
 
05:18:50.090 --> 05:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
perhaps incongruent incongruities that
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
um we've heard testimony we've heard
 
05:18:55.730 --> 05:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
we've heard some opinions here that it
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
is not our place as a legislature to be
 
05:18:58.970 --> 05:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
doing this that it should be the experts
 
05:19:01.250 --> 05:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
who are doing this the experts reference
 
05:19:03.288 --> 05:19:03.298 align:start position:0%
were those at the Department of
 
05:19:06.530 --> 05:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
Education the Department of Education is
 
05:19:10.850 --> 05:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
the executive branch at the state level
 
05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
if they have the authority to dictate
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing down to the level of
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
the schools we absolutely have the
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
authority to tell the executive branch
 
05:19:26.448 --> 05:19:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:28.128 --> 05:19:28.138 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli and then
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative thank you just in terms
 
05:19:32.208 --> 05:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
of curriculum
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
um last term uh we passed the
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for personal finance
 
05:19:40.970 --> 05:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
in the schools overwhelmingly right
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
um the term before that we passed a
 
05:19:46.030 --> 05:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
requirement to learn about the Holocaust
 
05:19:50.050 --> 05:19:50.060 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly in the house so
 
05:19:54.170 --> 05:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
putting cursive into the statutes I
 
05:19:55.970 --> 05:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
think is uh not much different than
 
05:19:59.690 --> 05:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
those two uh Edition additions to the
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
school system
 
05:20:01.680 --> 05:20:03.890 align:start position:0%
school system
representative

05:20:03.890 --> 05:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:20:05.690 --> 05:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
just a comment don't you want less
 
05:20:10.850 --> 05:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:10.860 --> 05:20:13.730 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:20:13.730 --> 05:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:16.730 --> 05:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
honestly I the more and more I look at
 
05:20:18.890 --> 05:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
this I can't see a specific curriculum
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
and I really hope that there are paper
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
that there's paper and pencils in the
 
05:20:28.368 --> 05:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
school and that a teacher could maybe
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
draw on their own knowledge of how to
 
05:20:33.530 --> 05:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
write in order to teach cursive you
 
05:20:35.390 --> 05:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't even need a curriculum unless you
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
want to learn how to form the letters
 
05:20:39.530 --> 05:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
correctly and I don't know about the
 
05:20:41.570 --> 05:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
rest of you but at this point in time I
 
05:20:44.270 --> 05:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
have so much scrap paper after all of
 
05:20:46.250 --> 05:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
the stuff I've printed just in the month
 
05:20:48.350 --> 05:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
of being on this committee that I have
 
05:20:50.690 --> 05:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
found that I haven't needed that I could
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
contribute that to the schools and I
 
05:20:54.850 --> 05:20:54.860 align:start position:0%
would hand write the multiplication
 
05:20:58.128 --> 05:20:58.138 align:start position:0%
facts for them that's pretty simple I
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a curriculum it's
 
05:21:01.490 --> 05:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
just paper and pencil we're talking
 
05:21:01.500 --> 05:21:02.770 align:start position:0%
just paper and pencil we're talking
about

05:21:02.770 --> 05:21:02.780 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
I I just you know I don't know why we
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
make these things anymore this is a
 
05:21:11.208 --> 05:21:11.218 align:start position:0%
pencil by the way a pencil
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
um I carry a pencil with me all the time
 
05:21:14.690 --> 05:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
because I'm constantly just you know
 
05:21:16.490 --> 05:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
racing and I use more the other end of
 
05:21:19.070 --> 05:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
it than to let it in or the graphite end
 
05:21:21.708 --> 05:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
but in the other paper which I handed
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
out the importance of cursive
 
05:21:24.650 --> 05:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
handwriting or typewriting for learning
 
05:21:26.990 --> 05:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
in the classroom a high density EEG
 
05:21:29.570 --> 05:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
study of 12 year old children and young
 
05:21:29.580 --> 05:21:30.948 align:start position:0%
study of 12 year old children and young
adults

05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
adults
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
on the first page it says we suggest
 
05:21:36.530 --> 05:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
that children from an early age must be
 
05:21:39.708 --> 05:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
exposed to handwriting and drawing
 
05:21:42.530 --> 05:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
activities in school to establish the
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
neuronal oscillation patterns that are
 
05:21:47.810 --> 05:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
beneficial for learning we conclude that
 
05:21:49.788 --> 05:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
because of the benefits of sensory motor
 
05:21:51.830 --> 05:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
integration due to the larger
 
05:21:53.628 --> 05:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
involvement of the senses
 
05:21:56.868 --> 05:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
as well as fine and precisely controlled
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
hand movements when writing by hand and
 
05:22:01.550 --> 05:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
when drawing is vitally vital to
 
05:22:03.770 --> 05:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
maintain both activities and a learning
 
05:22:06.050 --> 05:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
environment to facilitate and optimize
 
05:22:06.060 --> 05:22:08.390 align:start position:0%
environment to facilitate and optimize
learning

05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
learning
 
05:22:10.128 --> 05:22:10.138 align:start position:0%
I don't see how this is going to be
 
05:22:12.230 --> 05:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
adding something into our curriculum my
 
05:22:14.930 --> 05:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
Lord I had it when I was in school and I
 
05:22:18.050 --> 05:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
apparently faded away and because yes we
 
05:22:19.730 --> 05:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
do have the keyboarding and all that
 
05:22:22.070 --> 05:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
right now but also if you read this and
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
look at the neurological gains by doing
 
05:22:24.480 --> 05:22:25.730 align:start position:0%
look at the neurological gains by doing
cursive

05:22:25.730 --> 05:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
cursive
 
05:22:28.128 --> 05:22:28.138 align:start position:0%
as opposed for example to taking notes
 
05:22:31.010 --> 05:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
using your computer the long-term memory
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
of what you put down yes you can type
 
05:22:34.850 --> 05:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
more than you can write
 
05:22:37.490 --> 05:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's in this report but you also then
 
05:22:39.170 --> 05:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
when it looks at the memory of what you
 
05:22:40.850 --> 05:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
type versus what you wrote you will
 
05:22:43.010 --> 05:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
learn you remember more that you hand
 
05:22:46.730 --> 05:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
wrote than you will by keyboarding
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
so you know it's to me it's just you
 
05:22:52.310 --> 05:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
know this is not adding a new curriculum
 
05:22:56.030 --> 05:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's part of language arts uh and we've
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
added things like Unified sports we do
 
05:23:00.170 --> 05:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things here you know and
 
05:23:01.970 --> 05:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
adding things into our statutory
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
language but here we're doing we have an
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try to ensure that this
 
05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
the skill is not lost
 
05:23:13.730 --> 05:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
and and uh so I again I'll be quiet
 
05:23:17.270 --> 05:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:18.480 --> 05:23:21.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:25.250 --> 05:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
I'm an expert I taught nine people how
 
05:23:28.250 --> 05:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
to read write and do arithmetic it was
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
not hard to figure out that they needed
 
05:23:32.330 --> 05:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
to learn cursive and that they needed to
 
05:23:34.730 --> 05:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
learn multiplication not turning not
 
05:23:37.310 --> 05:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
learning multiplication tables is the
 
05:23:39.530 --> 05:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
same as not teaching them what the dot
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
line with two dots over it means you're
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
missing a fundamental part a building
 
05:23:48.530 --> 05:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
block of this of this subject
 
05:23:51.128 --> 05:23:51.138 align:start position:0%
just as a person on the street
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
I was appalled when I heard that they
 
05:23:57.128 --> 05:23:57.138 align:start position:0%
were not teaching multiplication
 
05:23:59.270 --> 05:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
tables in the school I couldn't believe
 
05:24:02.208 --> 05:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
that that could possibly be going on so
 
05:24:05.628 --> 05:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
I am again
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
have been wrestling with what do you
 
05:24:11.090 --> 05:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
tell it to school to do what do you
 
05:24:13.490 --> 05:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
allow the process to take do you do it
 
05:24:15.230 --> 05:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
from the top down from the bottom up do
 
05:24:17.628 --> 05:24:17.638 align:start position:0%
you go to a local school board first but
 
05:24:19.310 --> 05:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
I think in this case
 
05:24:22.250 --> 05:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
this is really part of something that's
 
05:24:24.530 --> 05:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
been asked to be done and it isn't being
 
05:24:26.570 --> 05:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
done and we're seeing we have the
 
05:24:29.270 --> 05:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
benefit of the studies and see the
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
wisdom of this
 
05:24:33.470 --> 05:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
we are making this
 
05:24:35.868 --> 05:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
giving this to the Department of Ed and
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
the local schools to figure out how to
 
05:24:40.250 --> 05:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
do it we're not prescribing a curriculum
 
05:24:42.190 --> 05:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
people came and said it's not the
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
legislature's job to do curriculum this
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
isn't curriculum
 
05:24:50.570 --> 05:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
this is this course of study we've we're
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
used to putting in course of study and I
 
05:24:57.288 --> 05:24:57.298 align:start position:0%
have no problem with saying yes to this
 
05:24:57.298 --> 05:24:58.670 align:start position:0%
have no problem with saying yes to this
because

05:24:58.670 --> 05:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:25:05.448 --> 05:25:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
Russell Woodcock thank you chairman
 
05:25:09.708 --> 05:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the fact that you
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
remember that you took out the part
 
05:25:13.368 --> 05:25:13.378 align:start position:0%
about the memorization in terms of the
 
05:25:13.378 --> 05:25:14.448 align:start position:0%
about the memorization in terms of the
tables

05:25:14.448 --> 05:25:14.458 align:start position:0%
tables
 
05:25:15.410 --> 05:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the Learned
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
multiplication uh and I do I do believe
 
05:25:21.050 --> 05:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
a curse of handwriting are you looking
 
05:25:23.708 --> 05:25:23.718 align:start position:0%
at right now huh
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
look at yours the 13 16 word it said
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's it yeah the multiplication
 
05:25:31.010 --> 05:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
they're there just the word memorization
 
05:25:32.690 --> 05:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
out the table so
 
05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
um that being all said when I talk of my
 
05:25:36.530 --> 05:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
send notes to my extra money
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
ten-year-old granddaughter I can't
 
05:25:40.970 --> 05:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
figure out if she can't read cursive or
 
05:25:42.770 --> 05:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
she just can't read my person
 
05:25:44.750 --> 05:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
but considering my notes is probably
 
05:25:46.490 --> 05:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
just my cursive but not hers is probably
 
05:25:50.690 --> 05:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
fine that that being said I I I talk
 
05:25:52.070 --> 05:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
with our superintendent our assistant
 
05:25:54.050 --> 05:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
superintendent let's talk a couple of
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
people in our SAU uh and they are fusing
 
05:26:00.350 --> 05:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
we are curse of the schools but beyond
 
05:26:02.330 --> 05:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
all that I don't think it goes back to
 
05:26:04.128 --> 05:26:04.138 align:start position:0%
the same thing we talked about we talked
 
05:26:05.750 --> 05:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
about the immigration and naturalization
 
05:26:08.208 --> 05:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
test and the yada yada yada I don't
 
05:26:11.090 --> 05:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
think it's our place to put on local
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
schools what curriculum they have to
 
05:26:15.170 --> 05:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
teach do we think this around this table
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
everything that's pretty important yeah
 
05:26:18.170 --> 05:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
we should all do we all grew up with it
 
05:26:20.090 --> 05:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
I think it's very important that being
 
05:26:22.010 --> 05:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
said uh and people running out of
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
schools probably is really important to
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
suit it in where they can considering
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
all the other things they're going to do
 
05:26:28.128 --> 05:26:28.138 align:start position:0%
but I don't think we should be
 
05:26:30.410 --> 05:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
delegating or regulating local school
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
boys in terms of what curriculum they
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
have to write or how they have to do it
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ford
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
I just thank you Mr chair I would just
 
05:26:43.610 --> 05:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
like to add one other component to the
 
05:26:43.620 --> 05:26:44.810 align:start position:0%
like to add one other component to the
discussion

05:26:44.810 --> 05:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:26:47.390 --> 05:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
we now have through artificial
 
05:26:47.400 --> 05:26:48.770 align:start position:0%
we now have through artificial
intelligence

05:26:48.770 --> 05:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
intelligence
 
05:26:51.230 --> 05:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to have a program that
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
writes your essay for you
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
that cannot be be done in cursive
 
05:26:59.810 --> 05:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
05:27:03.190 --> 05:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's where you can get an honest thought
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
expressed on paper without being able to
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
push a button and have some other
 
05:27:08.160 --> 05:27:09.110 align:start position:0%
push a button and have some other
machine

05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
machine
 
05:27:11.330 --> 05:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
write your paper for you
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's a different world there
 
05:27:16.430 --> 05:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
very different world
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important that we keep
 
05:27:22.368 --> 05:27:22.378 align:start position:0%
as much as we can true to what it is
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
that all of us experience that was good
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
and I think this Falls in that category
 
05:27:33.410 --> 05:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
you can't cheat in cursive you've got to
 
05:27:35.690 --> 05:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
write it yourself
 
05:27:40.868 --> 05:27:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:44.810 --> 05:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
further discussion Mr chairman could you
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
clarify where we are from a
 
05:27:49.490 --> 05:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
parliamentary procedure standpoint on on
 
05:27:51.230 --> 05:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
what's being considered we've talked
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
about the bill
 
05:27:56.510 --> 05:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh what is is been put
 
05:27:58.610 --> 05:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
forward but it hasn't been made a motion
 
05:28:00.650 --> 05:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
okay all right so that's where we would
 
05:28:03.530 --> 05:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
be has the bill has the original Bill
 
05:28:06.350 --> 05:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
been moved yes it has yes the original
 
05:28:09.530 --> 05:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
bill was moved and through the
 
05:28:12.530 --> 05:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
discussion we got into this
 
05:28:14.930 --> 05:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I I did pass that around but I never
 
05:28:17.628 --> 05:28:17.638 align:start position:0%
made the motion uh regarding that
 
05:28:17.638 --> 05:28:18.770 align:start position:0%
made the motion uh regarding that
particular

05:28:18.770 --> 05:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:28:21.890 --> 05:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment trying to get a feel I I
 
05:28:23.448 --> 05:28:23.458 align:start position:0%
got the same feel I thought we would get
 
05:28:24.770 --> 05:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
from this
 
05:28:24.780 --> 05:28:26.230 align:start position:0%
from this
um

05:28:26.230 --> 05:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:28.610 --> 05:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to make the motion right
 
05:28:32.810 --> 05:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
now uh to on on this amendment I don't
 
05:28:34.368 --> 05:28:34.378 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that from it's buried
 
05:28:36.770 --> 05:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
under all the paperwork
 
05:28:40.010 --> 05:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
what's the number of 360. I'd I'd make
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
the motion that we mend this bill at 03
 
05:28:43.440 --> 05:28:47.110 align:start position:0%
the motion that we mend this bill at 03
16h

05:28:47.110 --> 05:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:49.368 --> 05:28:49.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:52.910 --> 05:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
a second or second okay so we do have
 
05:28:54.650 --> 05:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
that Amendment on the table right now
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
we've had some discussion regarding it
 
05:28:56.878 --> 05:28:58.368 align:start position:0%
we've had some discussion regarding it
so

05:28:58.368 --> 05:28:58.378 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:29:00.050 --> 05:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
um it was second by represent
 
05:29:02.208 --> 05:29:02.218 align:start position:0%
representative representative cordelli
 
05:29:04.190 --> 05:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
either one
 
05:29:06.770 --> 05:29:06.780 align:start position:0%

05:29:21.050 --> 05:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
this amendment requires that shall be
 
05:29:23.090 --> 05:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
shall both of those subjects shall be
 
05:29:25.550 --> 05:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
provided in by the end of the fifth
 
05:29:25.560 --> 05:29:26.570 align:start position:0%
provided in by the end of the fifth
grade

05:29:26.570 --> 05:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
grade
 
05:29:29.270 --> 05:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anything about Mastery or
 
05:29:31.070 --> 05:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
anything such that it just says you
 
05:29:33.128 --> 05:29:33.138 align:start position:0%
shall provide instruction
 
05:29:37.490 --> 05:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
in these particular areas so
 
05:29:37.500 --> 05:29:38.150 align:start position:0%
in these particular areas so
um

05:29:38.150 --> 05:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:46.080 --> 05:29:48.708 align:start position:0%
 
Mike

05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:50.410 --> 05:29:50.420 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you over here yeah I'm
 
05:29:52.920 --> 05:29:54.350 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you over here yeah I'm
sorry

05:29:54.350 --> 05:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:29:56.390 --> 05:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
um whether memorization of
 
05:29:59.750 --> 05:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables is now in there or
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
not in there because the heading says
 
05:30:04.250 --> 05:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
cursive handwriting and memorization and
 
05:30:06.948 --> 05:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables but then down when
 
05:30:09.288 --> 05:30:09.298 align:start position:0%
it talks about multiplication the tables
 
05:30:12.230 --> 05:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
it just says provide instruction of the
 
05:30:13.910 --> 05:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables by the end of
 
05:30:16.310 --> 05:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
fifth grade and what does that mean the
 
05:30:18.530 --> 05:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
original said
 
05:30:20.930 --> 05:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
um memorization of the multiplication
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
tables and the amendment just says
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
instruction of the multiplication tables
 
05:30:27.530 --> 05:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
well just explaining how a
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
multiplication table when I went over
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:39.230 --> 05:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I had which required the
 
05:30:40.970 --> 05:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
provided instruction cursive writing and
 
05:30:43.010 --> 05:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
in the second part encouraged the
 
05:30:45.470 --> 05:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
instruction in what they did they
 
05:30:48.288 --> 05:30:48.298 align:start position:0%
changed the one word encouraged to
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
provide in Part B there
 
05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
and and use the
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
um the old amendment to move forward
 
05:30:59.448 --> 05:30:59.458 align:start position:0%
where it would be you shall provide
 
05:31:02.030 --> 05:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
instruction in both of these areas
 
05:31:06.128 --> 05:31:06.138 align:start position:0%
um can we can we amend that back
 
05:31:09.890 --> 05:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
in front of us right now what I know we
 
05:31:12.170 --> 05:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
do I'm trying to figure out how to vote
 
05:31:14.570 --> 05:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
on this amendment because part of the
 
05:31:17.628 --> 05:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
point of this was memorization of
 
05:31:20.330 --> 05:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables and that's not in
 
05:31:20.340 --> 05:31:22.010 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables and that's not in
there

05:31:22.010 --> 05:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:31:22.020 --> 05:31:23.030 align:start position:0%
there
um

05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
is this an early bill
 
05:31:30.050 --> 05:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:31.850 --> 05:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
and that's what is there any more
 
05:31:33.410 --> 05:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill
 
05:31:35.208 --> 05:31:35.218 align:start position:0%
well that was my question on this
 
05:31:36.830 --> 05:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
amendment we're going to go ahead and
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment and vote your
 
05:31:42.050 --> 05:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
hearts out my question didn't get
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
answered is having memorization of the
 
05:31:47.390 --> 05:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables in the title mean
 
05:31:48.770 --> 05:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
that that's what they're supposed to be
 
05:31:50.570 --> 05:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
doing or just the fact that it says
 
05:31:53.990 --> 05:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
provide instruction of take it out so is
 
05:31:56.690 --> 05:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
it in or is it out this went through OLS
 
05:31:59.628 --> 05:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
to have the you know the support of OLS
 
05:32:01.850 --> 05:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
they wrote it up this way and when they
 
05:32:04.010 --> 05:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
review they put it under the same area
 
05:32:06.170 --> 05:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
category where we've always had curse of
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
handwriting and memorization of
 
05:32:10.910 --> 05:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables uh so without they
 
05:32:13.788 --> 05:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
just put it under the same title that
 
05:32:16.128 --> 05:32:16.138 align:start position:0%
we've had there since this original bill
 
05:32:19.368 --> 05:32:19.378 align:start position:0%
is put forth by Senator Stiles
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
and back then it was put forth as shall
 
05:32:25.430 --> 05:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
and we changed it to encourage
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
and now you're now we're this this
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
amendment would change it to provide so
 
05:32:38.650 --> 05:32:38.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I I kind of make one quick
 
05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
comment all these sheets up here I'm
 
05:32:45.708 --> 05:32:45.718 align:start position:0%
filling in cursive and I can't help see
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
the irony of that so if we want to find
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
like have clerks in the future might be
 
05:32:52.970 --> 05:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
a good idea for yes kids to learn so
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:01.010 --> 05:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
proceed okay

05:35:46.368 --> 05:35:46.378 align:start position:0%
okay I make a motion to itl is there a
 
05:35:46.378 --> 05:35:48.110 align:start position:0%
okay I make a motion to itl is there a
second

05:35:48.110 --> 05:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:35:50.990 --> 05:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion made to itl made
 
05:35:52.910 --> 05:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
by representative cascadden and second
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:04.430 --> 05:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:06.730 --> 05:36:06.740 align:start position:0%
what do I say although
 
05:36:08.570 --> 05:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
so what you're going to have to do is
 
05:36:09.948 --> 05:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have a fun time I wasn't
 
05:36:13.330 --> 05:36:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:16.010 --> 05:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
all right so if you're you're basically
 
05:36:18.170 --> 05:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
you have the position this should not go
 
05:36:20.030 --> 05:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
forward okay it should not go forward
 
05:36:22.430 --> 05:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
because it is instructional practices
 
05:36:24.830 --> 05:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
that is better placed and served in
 
05:36:26.750 --> 05:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
minimum standards
 
05:36:30.288 --> 05:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
versus a top-down mandate
 
05:36:34.490 --> 05:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
I think it should be killed
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
05:36:42.530 --> 05:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
and there was a second from and that's a
 
05:36:44.030 --> 05:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
ditto yeah
 
05:36:47.090 --> 05:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion I wasn't ready
 
05:36:49.128 --> 05:36:49.138 align:start position:0%
represent Ford and then represent
 
05:36:49.138 --> 05:36:50.510 align:start position:0%
represent Ford and then represent
Belcher

05:36:50.510 --> 05:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
05:36:52.910 --> 05:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
if this build
 
05:36:55.310 --> 05:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:36:58.390 --> 05:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
if we do not
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
encourage or require the teaching of
 
05:37:01.200 --> 05:37:02.628 align:start position:0%
encourage or require the teaching of
cursive

05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
cursive
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
you will then require of every freshman
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
English student that they have a
 
05:37:07.920 --> 05:37:09.288 align:start position:0%
English student that they have a
calculator

05:37:09.288 --> 05:37:09.298 align:start position:0%
calculator
 
05:37:12.350 --> 05:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
that they must have one because they
 
05:37:14.208 --> 05:37:14.218 align:start position:0%
won't be able to take out their pen and
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
write an essay in class
 
05:37:19.490 --> 05:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
05:37:22.250 --> 05:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
every one of you did it time and time
 
05:37:25.610 --> 05:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
and time again I've assigned I don't
 
05:37:28.670 --> 05:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
even know how many thousands
 
05:37:31.490 --> 05:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
and if you say to every student you have
 
05:37:34.368 --> 05:37:34.378 align:start position:0%
to show up with a device to take
 
05:37:35.810 --> 05:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
freshman English
 
05:37:37.850 --> 05:37:37.860 align:start position:0%
there'll be some students who can't show
 
05:37:37.860 --> 05:37:40.610 align:start position:0%
there'll be some students who can't show
up

05:37:40.610 --> 05:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:43.430 --> 05:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
I mean that's just when you get hung up
 
05:37:45.470 --> 05:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
on that sort of thing you forget that
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
the technology and and
 
05:37:50.090 --> 05:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
the Germans pin their pencil is
 
05:37:50.100 --> 05:37:52.310 align:start position:0%
the Germans pin their pencil is
technology

05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
technology
 
05:37:54.708 --> 05:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
and you've raised the standard quite a
 
05:37:58.190 --> 05:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
lot and the cost quite a lot
 
05:38:00.890 --> 05:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
you've also prevented the person from
 
05:38:04.490 --> 05:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
creating an original document in writing
 
05:38:07.190 --> 05:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
or submission for evaluation
 
05:38:10.730 --> 05:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:12.830 --> 05:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
and then you get the intrusion of
 
05:38:15.410 --> 05:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
and so you're changing the very Niche
 
05:38:22.490 --> 05:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
nature of teaching and learning writing
 
05:38:25.970 --> 05:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
it's that transformative
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
I would think seriously about taking
 
05:38:31.368 --> 05:38:31.378 align:start position:0%
writing out of your curriculum represent
 
05:38:31.378 --> 05:38:32.510 align:start position:0%
writing out of your curriculum represent
Belcher

05:38:32.510 --> 05:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
05:38:34.128 --> 05:38:34.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
05:38:37.070 --> 05:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
clarify and be very clear that whether
 
05:38:39.170 --> 05:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
this guideline were to be promulgated by
 
05:38:41.208 --> 05:38:41.218 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education will arrest
 
05:38:43.368 --> 05:38:43.378 align:start position:0%
as the legislature that is coming from
 
05:38:45.890 --> 05:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
the level of the state going down onto
 
05:38:48.590 --> 05:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
the the local districts and we being the
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative of the people are in the
 
05:38:54.730 --> 05:38:54.740 align:start position:0%
Constitutional position to be doing this
 
05:38:57.708 --> 05:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
disruption cordial I just want to
 
05:39:01.310 --> 05:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
re-emphasize my belief that
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
if you cannot read cursive
 
05:39:06.770 --> 05:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
you are somewhat illiterate it's a it's
 
05:39:09.470 --> 05:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
another form of illiteracy
 
05:39:11.930 --> 05:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
um as I said I had many
 
05:39:14.868 --> 05:39:14.878 align:start position:0%
College freshmen and I would write very
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
neatly I'll add I have very good
 
05:39:16.798 --> 05:39:18.170 align:start position:0%
neatly I'll add I have very good
penmanship

05:39:18.170 --> 05:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
penmanship
 
05:39:20.208 --> 05:39:20.218 align:start position:0%
and I would write on their papers a lot
 
05:39:21.770 --> 05:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
of comments
 
05:39:21.780 --> 05:39:23.930 align:start position:0%
of comments
and

05:39:23.930 --> 05:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:26.208 --> 05:39:26.218 align:start position:0%
there were quite a few
 
05:39:28.788 --> 05:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
who couldn't read them
 
05:39:31.010 --> 05:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
so I would think seriously again as you
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
vote on this
 
05:39:32.400 --> 05:39:36.830 align:start position:0%
vote on this
um

05:39:36.830 --> 05:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:38.930 --> 05:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave it at that I have a lot
 
05:39:40.430 --> 05:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
more to say but
 
05:39:42.830 --> 05:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
I used to get a lot of red comments on
 
05:39:44.930 --> 05:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
my spelling papers too
 
05:39:44.940 --> 05:39:46.490 align:start position:0%
my spelling papers too
and

05:39:46.490 --> 05:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:46.500 --> 05:39:50.288 align:start position:0%
and
thanks

05:39:50.288 --> 05:39:50.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:52.850 --> 05:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I've just remembered that was
 
05:39:54.590 --> 05:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
one other thing I was gonna say I'm
 
05:39:54.600 --> 05:39:55.610 align:start position:0%
one other thing I was gonna say I'm
sorry

05:39:55.610 --> 05:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:39:57.490 --> 05:39:57.500 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:40:01.670 --> 05:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
also to those like myself who in when I
 
05:40:04.368 --> 05:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
taught I and I tried it both ways I
 
05:40:06.050 --> 05:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
tried during especially the pandemic
 
05:40:07.550 --> 05:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
when everything went
 
05:40:10.190 --> 05:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
online and I couldn't I couldn't have
 
05:40:12.470 --> 05:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
paper paper and while I would try doing
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
it the other way and it wasn't that I'm
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
technophobic at all I just thought
 
05:40:20.090 --> 05:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
better and I thought I was providing my
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
students with better comments because my
 
05:40:25.610 --> 05:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
brain would would think better to write
 
05:40:27.470 --> 05:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
them in cursive in the margins of their
 
05:40:30.350 --> 05:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
papers very copious notes about how to
 
05:40:32.448 --> 05:40:32.458 align:start position:0%
make their papers better but if they
 
05:40:34.930 --> 05:40:34.940 align:start position:0%
couldn't read them they could not
 
05:40:41.150 --> 05:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.160 --> 05:40:42.128 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:40:42.128 --> 05:40:42.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
coming over here first and then then
 
05:40:44.400 --> 05:40:45.310 align:start position:0%
coming over here first and then then
yeah

05:40:45.310 --> 05:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair just
 
05:40:50.930 --> 05:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
comment on on process too when um when
 
05:40:54.288 --> 05:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
executive departments create rules under
 
05:40:56.448 --> 05:40:56.458 align:start position:0%
the uh the authority given to them by
 
05:40:57.890 --> 05:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
05:41:00.050 --> 05:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
um you'll see on a number bills that
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
says uh the Department of Education is
 
05:41:05.750 --> 05:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
granted rule making Authority Under 541a
 
05:41:07.970 --> 05:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
um they will go ahead and make rules but
 
05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
then those rules don't get promulgated
 
05:41:11.690 --> 05:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
directly down to school districts they
 
05:41:13.430 --> 05:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
have to come back to the legislature
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
through the joint
 
05:41:17.090 --> 05:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
um legislative committee on
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rules uh which has
 
05:41:22.430 --> 05:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
members of the House and Senate uh of uh
 
05:41:24.410 --> 05:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know on it I the the total
 
05:41:25.910 --> 05:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
membership may be
 
05:41:28.850 --> 05:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
North at 10 less than 20. something like
 
05:41:32.570 --> 05:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
that and um and they deliberate and uh
 
05:41:34.550 --> 05:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
and and vote on the rules in Mesa and
 
05:41:37.250 --> 05:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
oftentimes send those rules back uh they
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
also get legal advice from um uh from
 
05:41:44.270 --> 05:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative services and the uh the
 
05:41:46.970 --> 05:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
um uh the budget assistant on uh on
 
05:41:49.190 --> 05:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
those rules and uh and sometimes with
 
05:41:52.430 --> 05:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice as well so so I I
 
05:41:55.070 --> 05:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
think to representative belcher's Point
 
05:41:58.970 --> 05:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
um there are there is a process uh that
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
always runs uh what runs through the
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
legislature prior to
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
um our constituents being um being told
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
something to do specifically by the uh
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
05:42:11.520 --> 05:42:13.090 align:start position:0%
executive branch
foreign

05:42:13.090 --> 05:42:13.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:42:16.010 --> 05:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
it's also for example when you have
 
05:42:17.510 --> 05:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
attorney Merrill over there doing that
 
05:42:20.090 --> 05:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
in gel car the first thing they're going
 
05:42:22.390 --> 05:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
to do is look at the green book there
 
05:42:26.930 --> 05:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
and say is this rule supported through
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
this this law if it's not then
 
05:42:34.368 --> 05:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
hopefully the gel card refuses to accept
 
05:42:36.590 --> 05:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
those rules and we've seen stuff come
 
05:42:38.270 --> 05:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
through though oftentimes there is no
 
05:42:42.470 --> 05:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to support so I
 
05:42:45.650 --> 05:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
don't see gel car really as as our
 
05:42:49.310 --> 05:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
oversight in they are to a degree but
 
05:42:51.590 --> 05:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're the the oversight that I really
 
05:42:54.350 --> 05:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
see that we have that we have to really
 
05:42:56.750 --> 05:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
utilize is the legislative oversight
 
05:42:58.730 --> 05:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
committee on Improvement and assessment
 
05:43:00.490 --> 05:43:00.500 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that is a committee that needs to
 
05:43:04.610 --> 05:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
get on top we've talked a little bit
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
today earlier just a few moments ago
 
05:43:10.788 --> 05:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
regarding the 8306 rules uh which are
 
05:43:12.770 --> 05:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
the minimum Public School standards for
 
05:43:14.448 --> 05:43:14.458 align:start position:0%
public school the minimum standards for
 
05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
public school approval and the academic
 
05:43:18.850 --> 05:43:18.860 align:start position:0%
standards and
 
05:43:21.770 --> 05:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of the academic
 
05:43:24.890 --> 05:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
standards were all pointing to are is
 
05:43:27.288 --> 05:43:27.298 align:start position:0%
verbiage that's in what we call the old
 
05:43:29.448 --> 05:43:29.458 align:start position:0%
Frameworks or guidelines
 
05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
for instruction written back in 206 207
 
05:43:35.930 --> 05:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
in that era which are totally obsolete
 
05:43:38.570 --> 05:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
or really not even relevant to these
 
05:43:38.580 --> 05:43:39.730 align:start position:0%
or really not even relevant to these
world

05:43:39.730 --> 05:43:39.740 align:start position:0%
world
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I for one really am anxious to see
 
05:43:48.410 --> 05:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
these new rules or new yeah the the 306
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
to see if they really are what they're
 
05:43:51.120 --> 05:43:52.128 align:start position:0%
to see if they really are what they're
doing

05:43:52.128 --> 05:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:43:54.530 --> 05:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
and whether it's a
 
05:43:56.330 --> 05:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
well I'd want to say too much more
 
05:43:57.948 --> 05:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
whether those standards are also
 
05:44:01.910 --> 05:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
reflective of what you know we need so
 
05:44:03.230 --> 05:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
so Rick
 
05:44:03.240 --> 05:44:04.090 align:start position:0%
so Rick
um

05:44:04.090 --> 05:44:04.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
and you bring up a I think a very
 
05:44:08.868 --> 05:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
important point about our our commit our
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
public at Public Schools oversight
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
committee public education oversight
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee and um I'm just suggesting
 
05:44:20.570 --> 05:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
maybe rather than taking this up on a on
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
a committee no recommendation and and
 
05:44:25.310 --> 05:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
banging it out on the floor
 
05:44:28.850 --> 05:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
um in two weeks that um that that if
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
there's no rush on on this thing or
 
05:44:33.770 --> 05:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to retain this thing bring
 
05:44:36.650 --> 05:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
it up talk about it at the the oversight
 
05:44:39.770 --> 05:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh committee and bring it back bring it
 
05:44:41.330 --> 05:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
back next year because right right now
 
05:44:45.110 --> 05:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
obviously it we're split on um on this
 
05:44:47.868 --> 05:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
and and maybe maybe retaining it having
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
it go to oversight committee taking a
 
05:44:52.910 --> 05:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
look at the three that the um at the 306
 
05:44:55.368 --> 05:44:55.378 align:start position:0%
rules the rule Draft when it does come
 
05:44:58.010 --> 05:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
out and I mean maybe we're sort of
 
05:45:00.170 --> 05:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
putting a cart before the horse in this
 
05:45:03.288 --> 05:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
represent mile yeah on that on that note
 
05:45:05.208 --> 05:45:05.218 align:start position:0%
I think I don't think anybody here is
 
05:45:07.730 --> 05:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
disagreeing I'm not disagreeing with the
 
05:45:10.010 --> 05:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
need for cursive or multiplication
 
05:45:12.530 --> 05:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
tables absolutely not it's a it's a
 
05:45:14.990 --> 05:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
procedural question that that I'm
 
05:45:16.910 --> 05:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about and I think that's what
 
05:45:18.470 --> 05:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative Luna was talking about
 
05:45:20.930 --> 05:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
and that might be a way I mean I I hate
 
05:45:23.810 --> 05:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
like heck to continue to put things off
 
05:45:25.490 --> 05:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
Etc because we've got a hell of a lot of
 
05:45:28.670 --> 05:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
stuff to do here but I think this might
 
05:45:31.548 --> 05:45:31.558 align:start position:0%
be uh clarified if we have a little more
 
05:45:33.830 --> 05:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
time to look at that because again as
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
I'm saying nobody's here saying that
 
05:45:38.570 --> 05:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
cursive writing and multiplication are
 
05:45:41.270 --> 05:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
bad it's a procedural question on what's
 
05:45:43.910 --> 05:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
what should be who who should be
 
05:45:45.948 --> 05:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
directing this I think and I think
 
05:45:48.410 --> 05:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
perhaps we have a little more time that
 
05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
might be clarified so that we could have
 
05:45:50.760 --> 05:45:52.190 align:start position:0%
might be clarified so that we could have
a

05:45:52.190 --> 05:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:45:52.200 --> 05:45:52.930 align:start position:0%
a
um

05:45:52.930 --> 05:45:52.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:55.490 --> 05:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote out of this committee
 
05:45:58.368 --> 05:45:58.378 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you I
 
05:46:00.170 --> 05:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
05:46:00.180 --> 05:46:01.190 align:start position:0%
believe that
um

05:46:01.190 --> 05:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
going forward with this if it gets
 
05:46:06.288 --> 05:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
passed we'll give the
 
05:46:09.970 --> 05:46:09.980 align:start position:0%
um 306 group legislative
 
05:46:13.730 --> 05:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
basis for putting that into the minimum
 
05:46:13.740 --> 05:46:15.250 align:start position:0%
basis for putting that into the minimum
standards

05:46:15.250 --> 05:46:15.260 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:46:17.690 --> 05:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
otherwise they don't there is no
 
05:46:20.570 --> 05:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
legislative basis and I think I don't
 
05:46:23.390 --> 05:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
know if more discussion on this we've
 
05:46:25.930 --> 05:46:25.940 align:start position:0%
discussed it quite a bit over the past
 
05:46:28.670 --> 05:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and today I don't know if any
 
05:46:31.010 --> 05:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
more discussion is going to change
 
05:46:34.010 --> 05:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
things one way or the other and so I'm
 
05:46:37.570 --> 05:46:37.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:40.970 --> 05:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
I mean a simple phone call Fred ramonte
 
05:46:42.830 --> 05:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
who's a coordinator of this thing whom
 
05:46:44.690 --> 05:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
I've been in touch with on this would
 
05:46:46.430 --> 05:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
would might be able to clarify that's
 
05:46:48.288 --> 05:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying I mean they they may have
 
05:46:52.030 --> 05:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:55.250 --> 05:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
yes represent Tanner this um is already
 
05:46:58.250 --> 05:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
in statute as a recommendation
 
05:47:00.410 --> 05:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is changing it to a
 
05:47:00.420 --> 05:47:02.570 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is changing it to a
requirement

05:47:02.570 --> 05:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:47:05.690 --> 05:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
um and therefore the the people that are
 
05:47:08.090 --> 05:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
looking at the book and looking at what
 
05:47:10.788 --> 05:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
we've already suggested
 
05:47:13.310 --> 05:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
um in developing these standards I mean
 
05:47:15.110 --> 05:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
it isn't like this is a brand new idea
 
05:47:16.850 --> 05:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
to them
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
right yeah no it this is not a new idea
 
05:47:24.770 --> 05:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
although we we have since net Senator
 
05:47:27.048 --> 05:47:27.058 align:start position:0%
Nancy Stiles introduced this thing years
 
05:47:27.058 --> 05:47:28.010 align:start position:0%
Nancy Stiles introduced this thing years
ago

05:47:28.010 --> 05:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:47:31.548 --> 05:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
we've we've had this this
 
05:47:36.110 --> 05:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
split on on on the issue that
 
05:47:38.448 --> 05:47:38.458 align:start position:0%
the curriculum and instruction is a
 
05:47:42.350 --> 05:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility supposedly of the
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
um local
 
05:47:46.510 --> 05:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
but then you look at the first Statute
 
05:47:49.570 --> 05:47:49.580 align:start position:0%
in this yellow book right here
 
05:47:52.970 --> 05:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
or the green one but I don't have
 
05:47:55.368 --> 05:47:55.378 align:start position:0%
stickies in that one yet
 
05:47:55.378 --> 05:47:58.390 align:start position:0%
stickies in that one yet
um

05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:02.090 --> 05:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
21n colon 1. the general court finds
 
05:48:04.250 --> 05:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
that students parents General citizensry
 
05:48:06.230 --> 05:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
local teachers administrators local
 
05:48:07.730 --> 05:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
government local school boards school
 
05:48:08.990 --> 05:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
administrative units and state
 
05:48:10.430 --> 05:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
government have a joint and share
 
05:48:12.110 --> 05:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the quality of
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
Education delivered through the public
 
05:48:15.770 --> 05:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
education system in the state of New
 
05:48:15.780 --> 05:48:18.948 align:start position:0%
education system in the state of New
Hampshire

05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:21.288 --> 05:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
getting you know I
 
05:48:24.048 --> 05:48:24.058 align:start position:0%
sometimes we say that the local has this
 
05:48:26.030 --> 05:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
response but I think it says joint and
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
shared responsibility
 
05:48:31.070 --> 05:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
and if if we as legislators are
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
contacted by people of those groups we
 
05:48:35.270 --> 05:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to move forward
 
05:48:37.910 --> 05:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
with legislation
 
05:48:39.948 --> 05:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
um I know we can wait for the executive
 
05:48:42.288 --> 05:48:42.298 align:start position:0%
branch to tell us how we're going to do
 
05:48:42.298 --> 05:48:44.090 align:start position:0%
branch to tell us how we're going to do
things

05:48:44.090 --> 05:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:48:46.490 --> 05:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not there I'm in the
 
05:48:47.930 --> 05:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
legislative branch
 
05:48:53.030 --> 05:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
and for for that reason and when I hear
 
05:48:56.090 --> 05:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
and what I see and when I see people
 
05:48:57.650 --> 05:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
holding their pencils I don't even know
 
05:48:59.090 --> 05:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
how they're doing it like that I just
 
05:49:03.070 --> 05:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
can't even grasp it and and and and and
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
unable and when I have a grandkid come
 
05:49:08.868 --> 05:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
home and say I'm really not can you
 
05:49:11.570 --> 05:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
manuscript it Papa instead of you know
 
05:49:13.430 --> 05:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
in your whatever you're doing I was
 
05:49:15.230 --> 05:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
basically doing the old zaner blowser
 
05:49:17.990 --> 05:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
type or a half breed of it maybe a
 
05:49:20.030 --> 05:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
little Palmer method in there and I was
 
05:49:23.270 --> 05:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
writing and and so that that's a little
 
05:49:25.788 --> 05:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
scary to me I I think we're we're losing
 
05:49:27.530 --> 05:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
something that's very valuable and we
 
05:49:29.510 --> 05:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
know neurologically it's very important
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
too and the brain does get developed so
 
05:49:36.230 --> 05:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
I I agree I I I have a distaste for
 
05:49:38.330 --> 05:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
sending as an education committee a bill
 
05:49:40.368 --> 05:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
that's basically some are going to see
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
is so simple
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
um to the floor with a 10 10 vote
 
05:49:46.670 --> 05:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to send spend a lot of
 
05:49:49.850 --> 05:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
time debating this thing and that's not
 
05:49:52.610 --> 05:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
the way it should be done I agree
 
05:49:55.310 --> 05:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
so I I don't really have a good answer
 
05:49:57.530 --> 05:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
on that right now yeah if we retain it
 
05:49:59.448 --> 05:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
you know we've retained you know this
 
05:49:59.458 --> 05:50:00.350 align:start position:0%
you know we've retained you know this
kind

05:50:00.350 --> 05:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
kind
 
05:50:02.570 --> 05:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
you know this whole thing for years you
 
05:50:06.048 --> 05:50:06.058 align:start position:0%
know when I first came to my caucus and
 
05:50:08.330 --> 05:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
I came with a bill saying yeah I I think
 
05:50:10.390 --> 05:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
the curse of writing is really important
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
and let's just leave the multiplication
 
05:50:14.930 --> 05:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
at a courage multiplication facts
 
05:50:16.430 --> 05:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
because there is a debate going on in
 
05:50:17.770 --> 05:50:17.780 align:start position:0%
that right in stemming out of California
 
05:50:20.090 --> 05:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
where there's two ways of teaching
 
05:50:22.490 --> 05:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
mathematics and and I agree
 
05:50:25.128 --> 05:50:25.138 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly with parts of one and all
 
05:50:26.930 --> 05:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
of the other
 
05:50:30.590 --> 05:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and so I there's change going on in
 
05:50:32.930 --> 05:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
our country but I I don't think I have
 
05:50:36.110 --> 05:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
in my own thinking room for change that
 
05:50:38.030 --> 05:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be teaching cursive right
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
we need to be teaching cursive
 
05:50:43.190 --> 05:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
and so in in providing instruction it
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about memorizing it
 
05:50:48.048 --> 05:50:48.058 align:start position:0%
it just says provide instruction
 
05:50:52.128 --> 05:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's not it's almost a
 
05:50:53.470 --> 05:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
step up from
 
05:50:57.770 --> 05:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
encourage it's it's it's not saying well
 
05:50:58.970 --> 05:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have this before
 
05:51:01.490 --> 05:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
you're going to get in sixth grade
 
05:51:04.490 --> 05:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh so I yeah I don't know if retain is
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
going to do it unless we can really
 
05:51:07.850 --> 05:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
actually sit down and try to come to
 
05:51:10.250 --> 05:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
some kind of a constructive positive end
 
05:51:13.250 --> 05:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
on this thing yeah so so Rick just as a
 
05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
sort of like Point Counterpoint on this
 
05:51:20.030 --> 05:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
I I I I I hear what you're saying
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
um and I agree that I think this is
 
05:51:24.708 --> 05:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
going to be a prolonged I mean if this
 
05:51:26.930 --> 05:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
comes out no recommendation this is
 
05:51:28.788 --> 05:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
going to be a prolonged
 
05:51:31.010 --> 05:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
thing on the floor
 
05:51:34.010 --> 05:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
um this is while it's important I think
 
05:51:36.048 --> 05:51:36.058 align:start position:0%
I think Mel said it really well that
 
05:51:38.570 --> 05:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
that none of us are disagreeing that
 
05:51:40.730 --> 05:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
that cursive is important that
 
05:51:42.230 --> 05:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
multiplication table is important I
 
05:51:44.150 --> 05:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of
 
05:51:46.670 --> 05:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
elements to curriculum that are that are
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
important for our kids to be um to be
 
05:51:49.440 --> 05:51:50.570 align:start position:0%
important for our kids to be um to be
learning

05:51:50.570 --> 05:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
learning
 
05:51:53.448 --> 05:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
um but also I think I think you know
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire are expecting a
 
05:51:57.830 --> 05:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
lot out of this legislature and we've
 
05:52:00.530 --> 05:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
got really you know big issues to to
 
05:52:03.470 --> 05:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
tackle and uh and we will be taking up
 
05:52:05.448 --> 05:52:05.458 align:start position:0%
big issues on the on the floor of the
 
05:52:08.150 --> 05:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
house I hate for this to be one of those
 
05:52:10.070 --> 05:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
ones that just gets right in the middle
 
05:52:13.970 --> 05:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
of it and puts the takes if we go back
 
05:52:17.868 --> 05:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
several years ago when we we look at the
 
05:52:20.570 --> 05:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
the teaching history and Civics our
 
05:52:22.250 --> 05:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
government that's in our statute you'll
 
05:52:24.230 --> 05:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
notice there's a portion there where it
 
05:52:26.448 --> 05:52:26.458 align:start position:0%
lists some topics Within
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
those topics were put in there by
 
05:52:31.070 --> 05:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
Senator dalessandro myself
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
and there are some things we believed in
 
05:52:37.548 --> 05:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
jointly together but we were just at
 
05:52:40.368 --> 05:52:40.378 align:start position:0%
that point we were in parting to
 
05:52:44.208 --> 05:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
the doe these are topics which will be
 
05:52:46.850 --> 05:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
included Within These subscribers you
 
05:52:48.770 --> 05:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
know yeah you're you're taught the
 
05:52:51.048 --> 05:52:51.058 align:start position:0%
Constitutional United States you you
 
05:52:53.270 --> 05:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
learn about the free market all that
 
05:52:55.490 --> 05:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
types that's in our in our laws
 
05:52:58.368 --> 05:52:58.378 align:start position:0%
getting down into the micro into the
 
05:52:58.378 --> 05:52:59.690 align:start position:0%
getting down into the micro into the
weeds

05:52:59.690 --> 05:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
weeds
 
05:52:59.700 --> 05:53:00.288 align:start position:0%
weeds
um

05:53:00.288 --> 05:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:02.090 --> 05:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
we didn't feel there's any need to go
 
05:53:03.708 --> 05:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
there that that's the local
 
05:53:03.718 --> 05:53:04.970 align:start position:0%
there that that's the local
responsibility

05:53:04.970 --> 05:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:53:07.070 --> 05:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
what you teach and how you teach and all
 
05:53:09.708 --> 05:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
that so I think there is room for us as
 
05:53:11.690 --> 05:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
an executive branch to teach some of the
 
05:53:13.490 --> 05:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
broad areas and this is just one of
 
05:53:16.610 --> 05:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
those broad areas within language arts
 
05:53:18.948 --> 05:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
English language arts
 
05:53:22.128 --> 05:53:22.138 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know I unless we can really
 
05:53:24.590 --> 05:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know keep go somewhere on that one
 
05:53:26.208 --> 05:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
we'll probably end up having a debate on
 
05:53:27.048 --> 05:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
05:53:29.090 --> 05:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
and that I don't look forward to right
 
05:53:31.670 --> 05:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
because that is not going to be a
 
05:53:33.230 --> 05:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
constructive thing for the people of the
 
05:53:35.150 --> 05:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
state to see us on the floor arguing
 
05:53:39.230 --> 05:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:41.150 --> 05:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
05:53:43.850 --> 05:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
I guess that you know um
 
05:53:45.830 --> 05:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to have to be there I I
 
05:53:47.510 --> 05:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
think that's you know as chair education
 
05:53:49.788 --> 05:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
I I think that would be a real wrong
 
05:53:52.430 --> 05:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
thing to do and we need to hammer this
 
05:53:53.930 --> 05:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
thing out in this committee and if we're
 
05:53:55.368 --> 05:53:55.378 align:start position:0%
not prepared to go out and having a big
 
05:53:57.170 --> 05:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
fight on the floor and that's what it'll
 
05:53:57.180 --> 05:53:58.010 align:start position:0%
fight on the floor and that's what it'll
be

05:53:58.010 --> 05:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:53:59.208 --> 05:53:59.218 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:54:02.810 --> 05:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
ugly then then why not retain it why why
 
05:54:05.930 --> 05:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
not retain it and and I'm willing to
 
05:54:08.208 --> 05:54:08.218 align:start position:0%
keep this here without retaining it for
 
05:54:09.948 --> 05:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
you know several weeks and if we can
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
work something out fine but
 
05:54:13.910 --> 05:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
um by March 16th we better have
 
05:54:15.650 --> 05:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
something on this one well let's let's
 
05:54:18.410 --> 05:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
let's keep it for a few weeks if we
 
05:54:20.270 --> 05:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
can't uh do something then we're going
 
05:54:21.770 --> 05:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
to have to vote it
 
05:54:24.288 --> 05:54:24.298 align:start position:0%
um either no recommendation or retain it
 
05:54:27.650 --> 05:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
but yeah but but I I give it a little
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
bit of time sure
 
05:54:32.030 --> 05:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair represent represent cordelli
 
05:54:34.250 --> 05:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
had us up first thank you
 
05:54:37.548 --> 05:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm hearing a lot of agreement that
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
the schools should be doing this
 
05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:48.170 --> 05:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
represent my life yeah I just uh I just
 
05:54:49.970 --> 05:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
emailed Fred vermonte to probably get
 
05:54:51.410 --> 05:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
some background of where we are with
 
05:54:54.048 --> 05:54:54.058 align:start position:0%
this if it's there even so just for the
 
05:54:56.030 --> 05:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
information the committee yeah I know
 
05:54:56.040 --> 05:54:58.970 align:start position:0%
information the committee yeah I know
Fred

05:54:58.970 --> 05:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:58.980 --> 05:55:00.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:55:00.190 --> 05:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:55:03.708 --> 05:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps in Belcher thank you Mr chair I
 
05:55:04.850 --> 05:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
just wanted to try to speak to the
 
05:55:07.850 --> 05:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
process for a moment and I would like to
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
put forward that whichever way we go
 
05:55:13.250 --> 05:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
with it we are in fact resolving the
 
05:55:15.470 --> 05:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
situation one way or the other if we
 
05:55:18.470 --> 05:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
would decide to go ahead with a vote we
 
05:55:20.090 --> 05:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
are sending a message and we're
 
05:55:23.090 --> 05:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
resolving that as a legislative branch
 
05:55:25.250 --> 05:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to get this done and
 
05:55:27.470 --> 05:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
move forward with it if we were to
 
05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
decide to retain it we are also
 
05:55:32.690 --> 05:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
resolving it in favor of
 
05:55:35.030 --> 05:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
so effectively subordinating ourselves
 
05:55:36.590 --> 05:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
to the rule-making authority that we
 
05:55:38.570 --> 05:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
already delegated to the executive
 
05:55:41.510 --> 05:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
branch and I think that Beyond more than
 
05:55:43.070 --> 05:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
just being the education committee which
 
05:55:46.190 --> 05:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
is huge we also have a responsibility to
 
05:55:48.410 --> 05:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
zealously guard the powers do this
 
05:55:53.448 --> 05:55:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:55.670 --> 05:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay so what what I'm going to do is I
 
05:55:58.190 --> 05:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
am going to not act on it any further
 
05:55:59.448 --> 05:55:59.458 align:start position:0%
today we're going to leave it right
 
05:56:01.788 --> 05:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
there so it's not out of our committee
 
05:56:03.948 --> 05:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
but I'm letting everybody know it will
 
05:56:05.390 --> 05:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
come out of this committee if we can't
 
05:56:08.330 --> 05:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
get some resolution by March 16th
 
05:56:11.330 --> 05:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
and so I I think that we can do it I'm
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to be positive and think we can do
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:22.368 --> 05:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
this area of learning so yeah there is a
 
05:56:22.378 --> 05:56:23.570 align:start position:0%
this area of learning so yeah there is a
motion

05:56:23.570 --> 05:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:56:27.410 --> 05:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
um right on the table of itl probably
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
complete that vote
 
05:56:32.990 --> 05:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
well can't we just withdraw it well but
 
05:56:35.090 --> 05:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
then we're then we're left with a with
 
05:56:37.070 --> 05:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
only one
 
05:56:40.190 --> 05:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
um right but if we go ahead with the itl
 
05:56:42.890 --> 05:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
then we've completed the whole process
 
05:56:47.330 --> 05:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
I think I think I may I think what
 
05:56:48.890 --> 05:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
chairman is saying we're just going to
 
05:56:50.810 --> 05:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
hold on it the thing that's on the floor
 
05:56:53.330 --> 05:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
right now is the ital motion when we
 
05:56:55.070 --> 05:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
come back to consider it that's the
 
05:56:56.510 --> 05:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
first thing that needs to be considered
 
05:56:59.330 --> 05:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
along with whatever other information
 
05:57:02.208 --> 05:57:02.218 align:start position:0%
that is correct I've I've done this in
 
05:57:03.590 --> 05:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
past years
 
05:57:06.410 --> 05:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
you know even closer to getting into the
 
05:57:08.208 --> 05:57:08.218 align:start position:0%
vote throwing the old gavel down said
 
05:57:10.128 --> 05:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
that's it guys we're done
 
05:57:13.548 --> 05:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
and and we all would go on caucus we'd
 
05:57:15.770 --> 05:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
come back with calmer heads
 
05:57:17.930 --> 05:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
um I think that can be done so we're
 
05:57:19.368 --> 05:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
going to just leave it right where we
 
05:57:20.770 --> 05:57:20.780 align:start position:0%
are right now
 
05:57:23.448 --> 05:57:23.458 align:start position:0%
and called a day on this particular Bill
 
05:57:26.030 --> 05:57:26.040 align:start position:0%

06:10:45.788 --> 06:10:45.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
06:10:47.570 --> 06:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
first of all I want to make sure that
 
06:10:50.810 --> 06:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
we're working off the same page I have a
 
06:10:55.128 --> 06:10:55.138 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note and that came that's not
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
the same that was in the original bill
 
06:10:58.610 --> 06:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
is that what we're all working on all
 
06:10:59.810 --> 06:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
right because this had different numbers
 
06:11:02.628 --> 06:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
from the original one what what what's
 
06:11:07.690 --> 06:11:07.700 align:start position:0%
the LBA number on your fiscal note uh
 
06:11:07.700 --> 06:11:09.490 align:start position:0%
the LBA number on your fiscal note uh
23-0341

06:11:09.490 --> 06:11:09.500 align:start position:0%
23-0341
 
06:11:18.368 --> 06:11:18.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:23.150 --> 06:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
same thing yeah and revised on 2 1 23.
 
06:11:30.410 --> 06:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:37.010 --> 06:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
I think that this was one that was sent
 
06:11:42.070 --> 06:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
to us by on the email
 
06:11:46.850 --> 06:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
okay it is oh three four one two one
 
06:11:52.610 --> 06:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:54.350 --> 06:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
so are we all working off the same page
 
06:11:55.788 --> 06:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
are the people that don't some may not
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
have this
 
06:11:57.360 --> 06:12:01.788 align:start position:0%
have this
um

06:12:01.788 --> 06:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:04.368 --> 06:12:04.378 align:start position:0%
um the difference is the numbers and the
 
06:12:08.448 --> 06:12:08.458 align:start position:0%
fiscal report uh and the back so it's
 
06:12:14.048 --> 06:12:14.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:17.330 --> 06:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I can do that I
 
06:12:19.610 --> 06:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh there are a couple other changes but
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's it went to saying the number of
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire operating the
 
06:12:27.410 --> 06:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
nslp is 5 456 which is the same as the
 
06:12:28.430 --> 06:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
last page
 
06:12:30.288 --> 06:12:30.298 align:start position:0%
number of schools in New Hampshire
 
06:12:33.410 --> 06:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
operating nslp but not the breakfast
 
06:12:36.410 --> 06:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
program 27 number of New Hampshire
 
06:12:38.448 --> 06:12:38.458 align:start position:0%
public charter schools not operating
 
06:12:42.230 --> 06:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
either program 34 rather than 43 before
 
06:12:44.090 --> 06:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
and the number of New Hampshire Public
 
06:12:46.730 --> 06:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
Schools not operating either breakfast
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
or lunch six the previous one said 153.
 
06:12:54.530 --> 06:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
so it's a big difference okay so we went
 
06:12:56.750 --> 06:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
with this a little bit last time so the
 
06:12:59.150 --> 06:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
reason I'm uh let's get the other change
 
06:13:03.170 --> 06:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
too okay um on the estimated increase
 
06:13:05.930 --> 06:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
up top on the on on the front side there
 
06:13:08.690 --> 06:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the old one it said 331
 
06:13:10.930 --> 06:13:10.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
194 000 in the new one one at least one
 
06:13:18.170 --> 06:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
ninth it says at least 194. yeah at
 
06:13:18.180 --> 06:13:19.330 align:start position:0%
ninth it says at least 194. yeah at
least

06:13:19.330 --> 06:13:19.340 align:start position:0%
least
 
06:13:22.368 --> 06:13:22.378 align:start position:0%
194 thousand dollars
 
06:13:25.910 --> 06:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
for fy25
 
06:13:29.448 --> 06:13:29.458 align:start position:0%
at least 196
 
06:13:31.910 --> 06:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
000 opposed to a three hundred thirty
 
06:13:35.330 --> 06:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars on the initial
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
and on 2026 at least two hundred two
 
06:13:43.610 --> 06:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars opposed to 343 thousand
 
06:13:43.620 --> 06:13:45.470 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars opposed to 343 thousand
dollars

06:13:45.470 --> 06:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:13:48.708 --> 06:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
those have changed yep
 
06:13:51.470 --> 06:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes
 
06:13:51.480 --> 06:13:53.530 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes
um

06:13:53.530 --> 06:13:53.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:56.208 --> 06:13:56.218 align:start position:0%
unless you were looking for more uh no
 
06:13:59.150 --> 06:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
no no okay thank you so so what I have
 
06:14:01.788 --> 06:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
to say has to do with this and the first
 
06:14:01.798 --> 06:14:02.750 align:start position:0%
to say has to do with this and the first
is

06:14:02.750 --> 06:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:14:04.610 --> 06:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
um that
 
06:14:06.770 --> 06:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
again it's not accurate because the
 
06:14:08.390 --> 06:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
public charter schools were going to be
 
06:14:12.230 --> 06:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:14.628 --> 06:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
I have I have an amendment okay so this
 
06:14:16.490 --> 06:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
one still talks about it as if they were
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
in it so it's been it's difficult to
 
06:14:20.690 --> 06:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
work off a sheep that you know probably
 
06:14:22.910 --> 06:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
might be changed but
 
06:14:22.920 --> 06:14:23.930 align:start position:0%
might be changed but
um

06:14:23.930 --> 06:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:26.810 --> 06:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
this we have never found out what the
 
06:14:30.590 --> 06:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
six schools that do not offer do not
 
06:14:32.090 --> 06:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
participate in either National program
 
06:14:37.610 --> 06:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
are doing are they successful fine uh do
 
06:14:38.990 --> 06:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
we need to make them a waiver because
 
06:14:41.690 --> 06:14:41.700 align:start position:0%
this requires all the schools to be in
 
06:14:42.970 --> 06:14:42.980 align:start position:0%
that program
 
06:14:46.670 --> 06:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we know yet enough to
 
06:14:50.390 --> 06:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
make to make that decision of the 27
 
06:14:52.910 --> 06:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
schools that do lunch the lunch program
 
06:14:55.670 --> 06:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
but not the breakfast program
 
06:14:57.830 --> 06:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
again we don't know why they haven't
 
06:15:00.948 --> 06:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
included the breakfast program they will
 
06:15:04.010 --> 06:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
be forced to be include the breakfast
 
06:15:06.708 --> 06:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
program we do not know if that involves
 
06:15:06.718 --> 06:15:08.948 align:start position:0%
program we do not know if that involves
Staffing

06:15:08.948 --> 06:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
06:15:08.958 --> 06:15:10.730 align:start position:0%
Staffing
facilities

06:15:10.730 --> 06:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
06:15:13.490 --> 06:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
or anything else that belongs with
 
06:15:16.250 --> 06:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
running a program so it's very little
 
06:15:18.590 --> 06:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
information to make a decision on and
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:28.368 --> 06:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
456 plus 27 plus 6 is very close to 500
 
06:15:31.128 --> 06:15:31.138 align:start position:0%
9 about 95 percent of the schools are
 
06:15:32.930 --> 06:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
already doing the breast press program
 
06:15:36.048 --> 06:15:36.058 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a mandate
 
06:15:39.590 --> 06:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
for about five percent of the schools
 
06:15:44.810 --> 06:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:49.548 --> 06:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
okay as the second I'm sorry
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you Mr chair
 
06:15:54.830 --> 06:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
um and just just to further add on to
 
06:15:57.350 --> 06:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
that and I can't comment on an amendment
 
06:15:58.610 --> 06:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
right now because what I have is the
 
06:15:59.990 --> 06:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill here in front of me and the if you
 
06:16:02.868 --> 06:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
the motion is itl so the bill as written
 
06:16:04.850 --> 06:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
as as I'm looking at it the number of
 
06:16:07.430 --> 06:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
schools that don't currently offer any
 
06:16:09.948 --> 06:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
breakfast or lunch program here I
 
06:16:12.730 --> 06:16:12.740 align:start position:0%
believe is
 
06:16:12.740 --> 06:16:14.330 align:start position:0%
believe is
34.

06:16:14.330 --> 06:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
34.
 
06:16:16.430 --> 06:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
of that at least some of these and I've
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
heard personally from them their very
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
existence would be threatened by this
 
06:16:22.310 --> 06:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill because they don't have the ability
 
06:16:24.170 --> 06:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
to just simply add the facilities
 
06:16:27.770 --> 06:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
necessary to offer these things on site
 
06:16:29.690 --> 06:16:29.700 align:start position:0%
some of them are currently doing other
 
06:16:33.530 --> 06:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
things bringing in food via third party
 
06:16:34.788 --> 06:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
and whatnot
 
06:16:36.650 --> 06:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
the second thing I would say is I don't
 
06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
know why we would take away the local
 
06:16:40.610 --> 06:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
Choice from these schools who are doing
 
06:16:43.788 --> 06:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
things right now that suit them we've
 
06:16:45.288 --> 06:16:45.298 align:start position:0%
heard testimony previously about school
 
06:16:47.270 --> 06:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
bus schedules if we make them have this
 
06:16:49.368 --> 06:16:49.378 align:start position:0%
this lunch Pro or I'm sorry this
 
06:16:51.170 --> 06:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
breakfast program come in are we going
 
06:16:53.448 --> 06:16:53.458 align:start position:0%
to have to change up bus schedules are
 
06:16:54.830 --> 06:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
we going to have to have this supervised
 
06:16:56.090 --> 06:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to renegotiate
 
06:16:58.430 --> 06:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
contracts around this there's a whole
 
06:16:59.750 --> 06:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff Beyond just what's
 
06:17:02.330 --> 06:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
obvious that this bill introduces which
 
06:17:05.208 --> 06:17:05.218 align:start position:0%
is why I believe we should idealism
 
06:17:05.218 --> 06:17:06.590 align:start position:0%
is why I believe we should idealism
yeah

06:17:06.590 --> 06:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:17:08.628 --> 06:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
 
06:17:09.770 --> 06:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
Allison were you going to discuss
 
06:17:12.350 --> 06:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
something yeah I was going to discuss my
 
06:17:13.970 --> 06:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it's not on the floor yet
 
06:17:16.910 --> 06:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
so I will not discuss it yeah
 
06:17:16.920 --> 06:17:18.110 align:start position:0%
so I will not discuss it yeah
yeah

06:17:18.110 --> 06:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:17:20.750 --> 06:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I understand that
 
06:17:23.090 --> 06:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
the motion is not on the floor
 
06:17:25.010 --> 06:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
but would it behoove the committee to
 
06:17:27.530 --> 06:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
know the contents of that
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be a direct
 
06:17:32.570 --> 06:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
assembly direct answer to both the maker
 
06:17:35.390 --> 06:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
and the seconder of the motion as it
 
06:17:38.750 --> 06:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
relates to it so it's a procedural issue
 
06:17:40.610 --> 06:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
of Mr chair that just to have him
 
06:17:43.670 --> 06:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
indicate what he plans to do with the
 
06:17:46.490 --> 06:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment that would change the original
 
06:17:46.500 --> 06:17:48.830 align:start position:0%
Amendment that would change the original
motion

06:17:48.830 --> 06:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:17:50.330 --> 06:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
well I don't know if it'll change it but
 
06:17:53.208 --> 06:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
but it is it's referencing and
 
06:17:54.708 --> 06:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
concerning that motion so he can go
 
06:17:57.830 --> 06:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
ahead and speak and and and address what
 
06:17:59.390 --> 06:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
he would have done with that Amendment
 
06:17:59.400 --> 06:18:02.868 align:start position:0%
he would have done with that Amendment
yes

06:18:02.868 --> 06:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:02.878 --> 06:18:04.010 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:18:04.010 --> 06:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:18:05.510 --> 06:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:18:07.850 --> 06:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative uh the amendment does
 
06:18:09.948 --> 06:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
three major things of one that pulls
 
06:18:12.530 --> 06:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
Charters out of of the bill it would not
 
06:18:15.288 --> 06:18:15.298 align:start position:0%
relate to Charter Schools two it changes
 
06:18:18.070 --> 06:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
the effective date to 2th of July 1
 
06:18:21.770 --> 06:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
2024 instead of 23 and it provides a
 
06:18:25.310 --> 06:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
waiver process for school districts who
 
06:18:27.490 --> 06:18:27.500 align:start position:0%
do not participate in the federal
 
06:18:30.530 --> 06:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
pre-orduce price lunch program and they
 
06:18:32.330 --> 06:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
can request a waiver from the Department
 
06:18:34.670 --> 06:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
of Education to that as long as they
 
06:18:36.708 --> 06:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
meet the nutritional guidelines and the
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price uh lunch income
 
06:18:42.048 --> 06:18:42.058 align:start position:0%
guidelines for whatever program they're
 
06:18:45.288 --> 06:18:45.298 align:start position:0%
offering those are the three major and
 
06:18:47.628 --> 06:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
just to be clear I I think that the
 
06:18:49.788 --> 06:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
numbers the numbers are clear that we're
 
06:18:52.670 --> 06:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
really talking about the 27 schools that
 
06:18:54.288 --> 06:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
don't provide breakfast but do provide
 
06:18:57.230 --> 06:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
lunch in the six who provide neither uh
 
06:18:59.628 --> 06:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
just an additional piece I have the uh
 
06:19:01.610 --> 06:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
autistical update from the Department of
 
06:19:05.390 --> 06:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
Education that I got yesterday which I
 
06:19:07.310 --> 06:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
would distribute as part the it's part
 
06:19:09.770 --> 06:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
of the amendment as well which kind of
 
06:19:11.990 --> 06:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
talks about money and how much the
 
06:19:14.868 --> 06:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
department would spend uh would have to
 
06:19:16.850 --> 06:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
spend that number keeps coming down and
 
06:19:18.530 --> 06:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
down and down and down because you're
 
06:19:20.628 --> 06:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely right we started at 156
 
06:19:24.770 --> 06:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
schools and now we're down to 27 27 and
 
06:19:27.830 --> 06:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh and six so that's my intention with
 
06:19:29.990 --> 06:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
if I have the opportunity to offer the
 
06:19:30.000 --> 06:19:32.990 align:start position:0%
if I have the opportunity to offer the
amendment

06:19:32.990 --> 06:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:35.868 --> 06:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps Sam McDonald a question for
 
06:19:37.368 --> 06:19:37.378 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison about the
 
06:19:40.430 --> 06:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
amendment so schools that use the waiver
 
06:19:42.590 --> 06:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
that would be allowed would they be
 
06:19:44.330 --> 06:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
waving out of the federal program but
 
06:19:46.430 --> 06:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
still be mandated to have provide
 
06:19:48.288 --> 06:19:48.298 align:start position:0%
breakfast for other means or are they
 
06:19:49.730 --> 06:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
waving out of providing breakfast
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
entirely because they may not be able to
 
06:19:53.390 --> 06:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
they would be covered the first part of
 
06:19:54.830 --> 06:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
it would be have to be providing
 
06:19:57.590 --> 06:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
Brentwood lunch and breakfast and you
 
06:19:59.330 --> 06:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
can't wave out of that but you can wave
 
06:20:01.970 --> 06:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
out of the other parts of it thank you
 
06:20:03.830 --> 06:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
represent Belgium
 
06:20:05.930 --> 06:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair justice so just to
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
speak in addition to the what we've just
 
06:20:09.110 --> 06:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
heard about the amendment
 
06:20:11.090 --> 06:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
I certainly can appreciate the idea that
 
06:20:12.650 --> 06:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools would come out of it and
 
06:20:15.890 --> 06:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
that would solve one problem however I
 
06:20:18.110 --> 06:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
think ultimately we just heard is that
 
06:20:20.650 --> 06:20:20.660 align:start position:0%
the amendment in effect
 
06:20:25.310 --> 06:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
would simply Force the schools to ask
 
06:20:27.708 --> 06:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
permission and then add administrative
 
06:20:30.410 --> 06:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
process to maintain the status quo
 
06:20:35.628 --> 06:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:39.288 --> 06:20:39.298 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Damon
 
06:20:41.868 --> 06:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair responding to
 
06:20:43.548 --> 06:20:43.558 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
06:20:45.470 --> 06:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
they would be maintaining a status quo
 
06:20:47.868 --> 06:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
in terms of the way that they obtain
 
06:20:51.288 --> 06:20:51.298 align:start position:0%
meals to be served but they would be
 
06:20:53.448 --> 06:20:53.458 align:start position:0%
expanding the meal service
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
because these are the schools that
 
06:20:56.270 --> 06:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
either don't have
 
06:20:58.010 --> 06:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch or don't have
 
06:21:01.490 --> 06:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
breakfast so it's not status quo
 
06:21:03.410 --> 06:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
well if maybe I'm sorry I wasn't clear
 
06:21:05.628 --> 06:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
what I meant what I meant by that is the
 
06:21:08.030 --> 06:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
status quo being if they currently are
 
06:21:10.430 --> 06:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
not part of that program they don't have
 
06:21:12.170 --> 06:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
to be part of that program if they are
 
06:21:13.850 --> 06:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
asked permission or given permission and
 
06:21:14.990 --> 06:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
then go through the administrative
 
06:21:18.170 --> 06:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
process to maintain that status so they
 
06:21:19.548 --> 06:21:19.558 align:start position:0%
could wind up just right where they're
 
06:21:24.350 --> 06:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:27.288 --> 06:21:27.298 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ray thank you Mr
 
06:21:30.230 --> 06:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'm curious if we know
 
06:21:33.288 --> 06:21:33.298 align:start position:0%
anything about the 27 schools because
 
06:21:35.690 --> 06:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between yes we
 
06:21:37.070 --> 06:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
have the facilities we just haven't
 
06:21:40.250 --> 06:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
chosen to do it and no we need facility
 
06:21:43.730 --> 06:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:46.670 --> 06:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
you guys know my favorite statute
 
06:21:53.270 --> 06:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
28a if we're mandating that they provide
 
06:21:55.850 --> 06:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
breakfast and we're not providing funds
 
06:21:59.810 --> 06:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
because the funds here were not to cover
 
06:22:04.390 --> 06:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
those all those facilities and the
 
06:22:07.910 --> 06:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
renegotiation with staff and all of the
 
06:22:09.590 --> 06:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
other stuff that's going to be required
 
06:22:11.390 --> 06:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
we did hear some of the schools the
 
06:22:13.070 --> 06:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
buses are just barely getting in there
 
06:22:16.250 --> 06:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
it by the Bell as it is they don't have
 
06:22:18.730 --> 06:22:18.740 align:start position:0%
staff on in the mornings you know the
 
06:22:21.708 --> 06:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
cafeteria staff so now you have to
 
06:22:24.948 --> 06:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
expand that that costs money we're
 
06:22:26.868 --> 06:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
telling them they have to do it we're
 
06:22:30.548 --> 06:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:32.570 --> 06:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and then
 
06:22:34.190 --> 06:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for those
 
06:22:35.930 --> 06:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
schools that aren't currently providing
 
06:22:38.810 --> 06:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
breakfast would there be
 
06:22:40.788 --> 06:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
um contract negotiations involved to
 
06:22:42.350 --> 06:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that those teachers were there
 
06:22:44.208 --> 06:22:44.218 align:start position:0%
earlier to cover
 
06:22:46.548 --> 06:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
um those students arriving for
 
06:22:49.868 --> 06:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:52.970 --> 06:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
senator cascad
 
06:22:54.650 --> 06:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
um question that I'm just not sure of
 
06:22:56.690 --> 06:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
because the fiscal impact is local so
 
06:22:58.548 --> 06:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put my taxpayer hat on for
 
06:23:00.010 --> 06:23:00.020 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
06:23:03.410 --> 06:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
what what kind of a dollar amount would
 
06:23:05.330 --> 06:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
we be expected for local school
 
06:23:08.690 --> 06:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
districts to add to their budgets
 
06:23:11.510 --> 06:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
because if there's a cost and I just
 
06:23:13.788 --> 06:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
want an idea because
 
06:23:15.470 --> 06:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
then there's a choice of cutting
 
06:23:18.110 --> 06:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
something over something else just
 
06:23:19.670 --> 06:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
curious I don't know I don't know what
 
06:23:21.948 --> 06:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
the local cost would be but
 
06:23:23.390 --> 06:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
curious Justin Allison you have anything
 
06:23:26.208 --> 06:23:26.218 align:start position:0%
I we sort of asked that question and
 
06:23:28.788 --> 06:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
nobody knows the answer to it uh the
 
06:23:30.590 --> 06:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
assumption that it may be an assumption
 
06:23:33.110 --> 06:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
under this legislation is that the state
 
06:23:34.610 --> 06:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
would pick up the costs for these
 
06:23:37.548 --> 06:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
additional parts of the bill
 
06:23:40.010 --> 06:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
okay represent Tanner
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
so care Sarge high school at least no
 
06:23:45.530 --> 06:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
one no one
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
um lives close enough to walk to school
 
06:23:50.090 --> 06:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
so everybody's either bussed in or they
 
06:23:53.208 --> 06:23:53.218 align:start position:0%
drive themselves in and when the
 
06:23:57.170 --> 06:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
breakfast program was first uh proposed
 
06:23:59.270 --> 06:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know that was one what you said was
 
06:24:00.770 --> 06:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
one of the problems that some of the
 
06:24:03.230 --> 06:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
buses arrive and the kids have maybe
 
06:24:05.090 --> 06:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
five minutes to go to their lockers and
 
06:24:06.890 --> 06:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
get to the you know homeroom or whatever
 
06:24:09.288 --> 06:24:09.298 align:start position:0%
the first period class is and what they
 
06:24:12.530 --> 06:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
did was they did a grab and go
 
06:24:15.650 --> 06:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
um to solve that problem and the cat at
 
06:24:18.110 --> 06:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
least the person who runs the cafeteria
 
06:24:19.970 --> 06:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
is always there at the very beginning of
 
06:24:21.650 --> 06:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
school anyway and had been right from
 
06:24:23.628 --> 06:24:23.638 align:start position:0%
the beginning so the grab and go was
 
06:24:25.128 --> 06:24:25.138 align:start position:0%
made the night before
 
06:24:28.010 --> 06:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
and the kids just came down checked it
 
06:24:31.368 --> 06:24:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:33.890 --> 06:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:24:33.900 --> 06:24:35.330 align:start position:0%
further discussion
yes

06:24:35.330 --> 06:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:24:37.548 --> 06:24:37.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:24:39.288 --> 06:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
that's a good point
 
06:24:42.530 --> 06:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I would like to know maybe
 
06:24:44.628 --> 06:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
if we pay for
 
06:24:46.670 --> 06:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
some schools now to put this into
 
06:24:46.680 --> 06:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
some schools now to put this into
process

06:24:47.750 --> 06:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:24:50.570 --> 06:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
do we need do we owe anything to those
 
06:24:53.390 --> 06:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
who've already been doing it already
 
06:24:53.400 --> 06:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
who've already been doing it already
um

06:24:53.990 --> 06:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:59.048 --> 06:24:59.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:01.970 --> 06:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh Woodcock Hey general I mean there are
 
06:25:03.890 --> 06:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
schools that sell breakfast and have the
 
06:25:06.530 --> 06:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
staff there all but 37 in the whole
 
06:25:08.208 --> 06:25:08.218 align:start position:0%
state and and they're they're making
 
06:25:10.368 --> 06:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
money in their in their their food
 
06:25:12.470 --> 06:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
service program that's why they're in
 
06:25:14.448 --> 06:25:14.458 align:start position:0%
business they keep it at least we break
 
06:25:16.010 --> 06:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
even running luck
 
06:25:18.770 --> 06:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I think the bigger 10 here is is
 
06:25:23.090 --> 06:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
the simple goal of this is to get the 34
 
06:25:24.788 --> 06:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
schools in the state
 
06:25:28.730 --> 06:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
offering 33 through what 33. thank you
 
06:25:31.010 --> 06:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
33 schools in the state
 
06:25:32.868 --> 06:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
I thought it was the 27th okay the 27
 
06:25:36.650 --> 06:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
schools the 27th school in the state the
 
06:25:38.990 --> 06:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
goal here to get those schools providing
 
06:25:42.230 --> 06:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
two meals a day that's the goal we all
 
06:25:44.868 --> 06:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
talked about cursive writing well hell I
 
06:25:46.430 --> 06:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
can't I'm starving to death I'm not
 
06:25:48.048 --> 06:25:48.058 align:start position:0%
talking about cursive writing I haven't
 
06:25:49.970 --> 06:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
eaten since last night's supper I mean
 
06:25:51.708 --> 06:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
come on folks this all this is a very
 
06:25:53.090 --> 06:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
basic stuff giving the kids the
 
06:25:55.430 --> 06:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a bottle of milk for
 
06:25:57.048 --> 06:25:57.058 align:start position:0%
juice and in a bar or something and
 
06:25:58.490 --> 06:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
they're on the way we are talking about
 
06:26:00.288 --> 06:26:00.298 align:start position:0%
homemade waffles here we're talking
 
06:26:01.610 --> 06:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
about grab go get something to eat get
 
06:26:04.190 --> 06:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
your brain going so the rest of your the
 
06:26:06.590 --> 06:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
day is not wasted this is a simple help
 
06:26:08.810 --> 06:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
and everybody stays pretty much doing it
 
06:26:10.670 --> 06:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
except for 34 schools to give those
 
06:26:12.708 --> 06:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
schools the opportunity
 
06:26:14.750 --> 06:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
um to do that that's all this is very
 
06:26:17.330 --> 06:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
simple thank you Mr chair are any of
 
06:26:20.090 --> 06:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
those 34 schools uh you you talk about
 
06:26:22.970 --> 06:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
place the 27 but go ahead or 27. Mommy
 
06:26:24.910 --> 06:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
look great machine correct you tell him
 
06:26:27.410 --> 06:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
are any of those schools
 
06:26:30.288 --> 06:26:30.298 align:start position:0%
you figured the number up providing any
 
06:26:31.730 --> 06:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:26:34.368 --> 06:26:34.378 align:start position:0%
nourishment for the kids at all in the
 
06:26:34.378 --> 06:26:35.030 align:start position:0%
nourishment for the kids at all in the
morning

06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
morning
 
06:26:37.690 --> 06:26:37.700 align:start position:0%
as far as we know on record just lunch
 
06:26:40.548 --> 06:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
just lunch I would not be surprised
 
06:26:43.548 --> 06:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
knowing all the schools as you do to get
 
06:26:45.708 --> 06:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
kids at something there but but it's not
 
06:26:47.810 --> 06:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
required so it doesn't have to be
 
06:26:50.990 --> 06:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
reps in Belcher thank you Mr chair I
 
06:26:52.730 --> 06:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
I've heard a couple times grab and go
 
06:26:55.310 --> 06:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I want I want to clarify where
 
06:26:57.708 --> 06:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
exactly are they going after they grab
 
06:26:59.990 --> 06:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
are we are we are they going to class
 
06:27:01.430 --> 06:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
where they're now eating and drinking
 
06:27:02.930 --> 06:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
are they sitting in front of a computer
 
06:27:04.250 --> 06:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
where they're typing and eating and
 
06:27:05.990 --> 06:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
drinking are is this interfering with
 
06:27:09.230 --> 06:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
what they're doing I don't
 
06:27:12.590 --> 06:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
know happens in Kearsarge um yeah they
 
06:27:15.410 --> 06:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
cut they there's usually one only one
 
06:27:18.110 --> 06:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
bus maybe uh that shows up that late
 
06:27:21.650 --> 06:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
maybe two and you're talking about maybe
 
06:27:24.890 --> 06:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
60 students so maybe one or two in your
 
06:27:29.030 --> 06:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
class are in that position and uh if
 
06:27:30.830 --> 06:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
they have a regular class rather than a
 
06:27:32.930 --> 06:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
study hall or
 
06:27:34.788 --> 06:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
um you know I I taught physical
 
06:27:36.708 --> 06:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
education so they would come down in the
 
06:27:39.230 --> 06:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
gym they'd eat their stuff in the locker
 
06:27:41.930 --> 06:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
room or whatever and then come out you
 
06:27:45.650 --> 06:27:45.660 align:start position:0%
know and and work in the gym but they uh
 
06:27:47.390 --> 06:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
other teachers allowed one or two you
 
06:27:49.128 --> 06:27:49.138 align:start position:0%
know it's only one or two students and
 
06:27:52.548 --> 06:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
everybody will you know let them go to
 
06:27:54.830 --> 06:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
the back of the room and and eat their
 
06:27:56.690 --> 06:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
stuff so
 
06:27:58.850 --> 06:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:27:58.860 --> 06:28:02.208 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

06:28:02.208 --> 06:28:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:02.218 --> 06:28:08.448 align:start position:0%
 
computers

06:28:08.448 --> 06:28:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:11.810 --> 06:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
if these six schools that aren't are not
 
06:28:14.628 --> 06:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
providing breakfast or lunch do we have
 
06:28:17.150 --> 06:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
any idea how many what the number of
 
06:28:19.310 --> 06:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
students would be from those schools
 
06:28:21.708 --> 06:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
that who would meet the federal income
 
06:28:23.868 --> 06:28:23.878 align:start position:0%
eligibility for
 
06:28:33.190 --> 06:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:35.570 --> 06:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it just says it doesn't say
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
they aren't doing it just says they're
 
06:28:38.690 --> 06:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
not operating in the National two
 
06:28:40.610 --> 06:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
national programs
 
06:28:42.770 --> 06:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
we don't really know exactly how they're
 
06:28:43.970 --> 06:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
oh right but we don't know whether or
 
06:28:47.570 --> 06:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
not they're calculating
 
06:28:49.670 --> 06:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
if the students meet the income
 
06:28:51.590 --> 06:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility yeah they may be doing both
 
06:28:53.990 --> 06:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
meals but not
 
06:28:55.788 --> 06:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
in the National program right so they
 
06:28:57.110 --> 06:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
might not be capturing those numbers
 
06:28:58.910 --> 06:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
that we need for the free and reduced
 
06:28:58.920 --> 06:29:01.850 align:start position:0%
that we need for the free and reduced
Aid

06:29:01.850 --> 06:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:01.860 --> 06:29:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:29:04.070 --> 06:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:04.080 --> 06:29:05.288 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:29:05.288 --> 06:29:05.298 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:29:07.430 --> 06:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
no right so that's what I'm getting at
 
06:29:09.530 --> 06:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
is the numbers that we need to calculate
 
06:29:14.230 --> 06:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:17.448 --> 06:29:17.458 align:start position:0%
it's the 27th the school the six the six
 
06:29:19.070 --> 06:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
are doing something but they're not
 
06:29:20.510 --> 06:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
following and some schools have their
 
06:29:22.250 --> 06:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
own program their own standards and then
 
06:29:23.810 --> 06:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
they have the waivers to do that that's
 
06:29:26.570 --> 06:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
so those those folks are eating but
 
06:29:29.230 --> 06:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the 37 schools
 
06:29:32.270 --> 06:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
27 thank you Margaret the 27 schools
 
06:29:35.628 --> 06:29:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:38.570 --> 06:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
one so we know that free and reduced
 
06:29:40.270 --> 06:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
feeling yeah
 
06:29:46.570 --> 06:29:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:49.190 --> 06:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
not participating in the program right
 
06:29:55.128 --> 06:29:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:55.138 --> 06:29:57.010 align:start position:0%
 
can program

06:29:57.010 --> 06:29:57.020 align:start position:0%
can program
 
06:30:00.830 --> 06:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
well I'm getting confused here we know
 
06:30:03.048 --> 06:30:03.058 align:start position:0%
all the kids in this state that are
 
06:30:06.770 --> 06:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
qualifying for free and reduced yes
 
06:30:12.610 --> 06:30:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:15.288 --> 06:30:15.298 align:start position:0%
yes but we supposedly are supposed to
 
06:30:17.170 --> 06:30:17.180 align:start position:0%
know them all yeah
 
06:30:19.850 --> 06:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
hypothetically but then so my question
 
06:30:21.288 --> 06:30:21.298 align:start position:0%
would be if they're
 
06:30:23.810 --> 06:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
if they're not operating either of the
 
06:30:26.570 --> 06:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
programs are those that are free and
 
06:30:26.580 --> 06:30:27.708 align:start position:0%
programs are those that are free and
reduced

06:30:27.708 --> 06:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
06:30:31.190 --> 06:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
getting whatever program is being used
 
06:30:33.770 --> 06:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
by it free and reduced other words are
 
06:30:36.350 --> 06:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
are they paying are they not paying do
 
06:30:38.810 --> 06:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:40.250 --> 06:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
but we're going to collect the free and
 
06:30:41.990 --> 06:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
reduce from them
 
06:30:44.990 --> 06:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:46.970 --> 06:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald
 
06:30:49.128 --> 06:30:49.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to say
 
06:30:50.448 --> 06:30:50.458 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like we're in agreement
 
06:30:52.128 --> 06:30:52.138 align:start position:0%
that we don't want students to be hungry
 
06:30:54.230 --> 06:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
and we don't want students to starve but
 
06:30:56.510 --> 06:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
really at what cost to the rest of
 
06:30:58.548 --> 06:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
academics is really the concern that
 
06:31:00.890 --> 06:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
some of us in the room share if we're
 
06:31:03.530 --> 06:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
hurting students in other ways by taking
 
06:31:06.708 --> 06:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
funds to direct to one program when we
 
06:31:08.270 --> 06:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what the schools are already
 
06:31:10.910 --> 06:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
doing it seems like that we're unsure
 
06:31:12.708 --> 06:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
with these six schools with these 27
 
06:31:14.750 --> 06:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
schools what other plans are in place
 
06:31:15.948 --> 06:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have a planning place
 
06:31:18.770 --> 06:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
as to why so it's irresponsible of us to
 
06:31:21.110 --> 06:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
move this forward not knowing the whole
 
06:31:22.970 --> 06:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
facts and how else we could be hurting
 
06:31:25.190 --> 06:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
students and hurting our schools and I
 
06:31:26.510 --> 06:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
just don't think we should move forward
 
06:31:28.910 --> 06:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
with something we keep saying we keep
 
06:31:30.530 --> 06:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
asking questions and the answer is well
 
06:31:32.208 --> 06:31:32.218 align:start position:0%
I don't know nobody knows we don't have
 
06:31:35.030 --> 06:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:38.090 --> 06:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
Jefferson Allison uh it gets in response
 
06:31:39.830 --> 06:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
to that we pass bills all the time here
 
06:31:42.410 --> 06:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
on policy and they go to finance and
 
06:31:44.208 --> 06:31:44.218 align:start position:0%
finance decides how much it's going to
 
06:31:46.970 --> 06:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
cost and sometimes it's fifty thousand
 
06:31:49.548 --> 06:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
dollars sometimes it's 150 million
 
06:31:51.770 --> 06:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
dollars but we don't get into
 
06:31:53.930 --> 06:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
degenerating what that number is and
 
06:31:57.948 --> 06:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:01.788 --> 06:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
Brooks and Lucas then represent Damon
 
06:32:03.890 --> 06:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
um the comment was made about just two
 
06:32:07.190 --> 06:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
or three kids but I'm noticing that it
 
06:32:08.930 --> 06:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
says all
 
06:32:11.470 --> 06:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
every pupil under its jurisdiction
 
06:32:14.750 --> 06:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
they'll be paying for those
 
06:32:16.850 --> 06:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
that are free and reduced but they have
 
06:32:19.368 --> 06:32:19.378 align:start position:0%
to make it available to every student
 
06:32:21.948 --> 06:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
under their jurisdiction I can tell you
 
06:32:24.288 --> 06:32:24.298 align:start position:0%
by golly if I could have gotten those
 
06:32:26.270 --> 06:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
extra five minutes to not eat breakfast
 
06:32:28.430 --> 06:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
before I got on the bus and to eat them
 
06:32:29.510 --> 06:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
at school
 
06:32:31.910 --> 06:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
that would have been me no I'll get to
 
06:32:32.930 --> 06:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
the school you haven't eaten I've been
 
06:32:32.940 --> 06:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
the school you haven't eaten I've been
great

06:32:33.830 --> 06:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
great
 
06:32:37.548 --> 06:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
I did eat but
 
06:32:39.170 --> 06:32:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:32:42.530 --> 06:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
I just really want people to reflect if
 
06:32:44.510 --> 06:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
you've ever had an experience being
 
06:32:44.520 --> 06:32:45.788 align:start position:0%
you've ever had an experience being
hungry

06:32:45.788 --> 06:32:45.798 align:start position:0%
hungry
 
06:32:49.250 --> 06:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
for let's say 24 hours how your brain
 
06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
works or doesn't work
 
06:32:54.948 --> 06:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
how your mood is how your impulse
 
06:32:58.190 --> 06:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:01.250 --> 06:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
being fed is important breakfast is
 
06:33:02.810 --> 06:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
particularly important the word actually
 
06:33:05.330 --> 06:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
means break fast as in most people
 
06:33:08.390 --> 06:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
didn't eat after a certain time in the
 
06:33:11.208 --> 06:33:11.218 align:start position:0%
evening for the longest interval of
 
06:33:13.190 --> 06:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
their 24-hour day we need to feed kids
 
06:33:15.230 --> 06:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't that complicated
 
06:33:16.788 --> 06:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
I don't perceive it as a lot of money
 
06:33:18.410 --> 06:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
for the value that it has
 
06:33:19.970 --> 06:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
and I would really strongly encourage
 
06:33:22.730 --> 06:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
people to appreciate our privilege that
 
06:33:24.830 --> 06:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
most of us are not hungry
 
06:33:28.310 --> 06:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
and make it so these kids aren't hungry
 
06:33:31.910 --> 06:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:34.250 --> 06:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
I have no objection to feeding to making
 
06:33:37.128 --> 06:33:37.138 align:start position:0%
sure kids are not hungry it's the how we
 
06:33:39.770 --> 06:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
do it is the question not that that it
 
06:33:42.708 --> 06:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
needs to be done and since
 
06:33:45.288 --> 06:33:45.298 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether these schools are
 
06:33:47.390 --> 06:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
providing for the kids who don't eat at
 
06:33:50.570 --> 06:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
home we don't know how much why they're
 
06:33:54.770 --> 06:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
not participating in the the state I
 
06:33:56.510 --> 06:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
mean the federal program we don't know
 
06:33:58.190 --> 06:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
that they're not providing just that
 
06:33:59.750 --> 06:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're not participating in the federal
 
06:33:59.760 --> 06:34:01.128 align:start position:0%
they're not participating in the federal
program

06:34:01.128 --> 06:34:01.138 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:34:03.530 --> 06:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
06:34:03.540 --> 06:34:04.310 align:start position:0%
we don't know
um

06:34:04.310 --> 06:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:07.128 --> 06:34:07.138 align:start position:0%
what extraneous circumstances they may
 
06:34:10.670 --> 06:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
have that we're now forcing them to do
 
06:34:13.128 --> 06:34:13.138 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to know how much it's
 
06:34:14.868 --> 06:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
going to cost them as a local school
 
06:34:17.448 --> 06:34:17.458 align:start position:0%
district that now you're saying oh but
 
06:34:20.530 --> 06:34:20.540 align:start position:0%
we'll cover it but that's not in here
 
06:34:24.410 --> 06:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
we don't know and and so how can we tell
 
06:34:26.810 --> 06:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
them they have to do it this way as
 
06:34:28.850 --> 06:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
opposed to some other way when we don't
 
06:34:31.788 --> 06:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
even know what this way is
 
06:34:31.798 --> 06:34:34.270 align:start position:0%
even know what this way is
foreign

06:34:34.270 --> 06:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:36.288 --> 06:34:36.298 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:34:39.650 --> 06:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
um so six schools we know are not
 
06:34:42.110 --> 06:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
operating in this National School
 
06:34:45.410 --> 06:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
breakfast program or the lunch program
 
06:34:45.420 --> 06:34:47.030 align:start position:0%
breakfast program or the lunch program
yes

06:34:47.030 --> 06:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:34:49.190 --> 06:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
so they might be feeding their kids
 
06:34:53.030 --> 06:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:56.990 --> 06:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
um likewise the 27 we know they're not
 
06:34:59.330 --> 06:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
in the school breakfast program but we
 
06:35:00.770 --> 06:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
don't know that they're not providing
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
them some kind of breakfast either
 
06:35:06.650 --> 06:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
so there's a heck of a lot we don't know
 
06:35:11.330 --> 06:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
and we're going to mandate things on
 
06:35:13.670 --> 06:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education and the
 
06:35:15.830 --> 06:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
local school districts based on things
 
06:35:18.288 --> 06:35:18.298 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
06:35:20.448 --> 06:35:20.458 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli I'm represent
 
06:35:23.770 --> 06:35:23.780 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you we do know
 
06:35:26.330 --> 06:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
provincelli that these schools are
 
06:35:28.730 --> 06:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
eligible for free reduced lunch
 
06:35:31.070 --> 06:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
we do know that they're prying students
 
06:35:34.310 --> 06:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
who are eligible for free reduced lunch
 
06:35:36.530 --> 06:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
we do know that and we do know all this
 
06:35:38.448 --> 06:35:38.458 align:start position:0%
that students are eligible for free and
 
06:35:40.850 --> 06:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch I'm not having any option
 
06:35:44.390 --> 06:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
to receive a free reduced breakfast even
 
06:35:46.190 --> 06:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
though they're eligible for it because
 
06:35:49.010 --> 06:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
these schools are not providing
 
06:35:51.230 --> 06:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students to get the
 
06:35:53.030 --> 06:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
breakfast although they qualify for the
 
06:35:55.010 --> 06:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
breakfast and they are doing the lunch
 
06:35:56.930 --> 06:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
because they qualify for lunch
 
06:35:58.910 --> 06:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
all we're trying to do is get schools
 
06:36:01.548 --> 06:36:01.558 align:start position:0%
that qualify for free and reduced lunch
 
06:36:04.250 --> 06:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
and breakfast to provide that for the
 
06:36:07.730 --> 06:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
youngsters just 34 schools doing that
 
06:36:09.110 --> 06:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we do know so we do know
 
06:36:10.670 --> 06:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it we do know but they
 
06:36:12.650 --> 06:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
they are going to do it for life so it's
 
06:36:14.448 --> 06:36:14.458 align:start position:0%
not like they are doing it they're just
 
06:36:15.708 --> 06:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
not doing breakfast and that's always
 
06:36:18.048 --> 06:36:18.058 align:start position:0%
saying do breakfast
 
06:36:21.350 --> 06:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's not your day with some brain food
 
06:36:23.570 --> 06:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
but what we don't know
 
06:36:25.490 --> 06:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
is whether those schools that are not
 
06:36:27.350 --> 06:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
participating in front aren't providing
 
06:36:30.350 --> 06:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of a nutrition to the kids in
 
06:36:31.730 --> 06:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
the morning well we know that well
 
06:36:33.470 --> 06:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's true we don't know what they
 
06:36:35.448 --> 06:36:35.458 align:start position:0%
aren't providing we don't know what any
 
06:36:37.610 --> 06:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
school isn't providing nor do we know
 
06:36:38.990 --> 06:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
what they are providing but we do know
 
06:36:40.610 --> 06:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
they are providing in accordance with
 
06:36:44.650 --> 06:36:44.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:47.810 --> 06:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
well that that might be question two you
 
06:36:51.310 --> 06:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
know a contractor could provide or even
 
06:36:55.910 --> 06:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
surpass the National Standard
 
06:36:59.510 --> 06:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:01.490 --> 06:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
06:37:04.368 --> 06:37:04.378 align:start position:0%
I think you don't let the perfect be the
 
06:37:05.990 --> 06:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
enemy of the good in this situation
 
06:37:09.770 --> 06:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
before we had uh breakfast at Pierce
 
06:37:09.780 --> 06:37:11.150 align:start position:0%
before we had uh breakfast at Pierce
Arch

06:37:11.150 --> 06:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
Arch
 
06:37:13.190 --> 06:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
um I was providing breakfast the nurse
 
06:37:15.590 --> 06:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
was providing breakfast I think we had
 
06:37:18.230 --> 06:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
some soda machines in the back hall uh
 
06:37:21.770 --> 06:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
kids were drinking soda for breakfast
 
06:37:23.810 --> 06:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:37:25.788 --> 06:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
you know I just
 
06:37:28.730 --> 06:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
um I we can argue over this and you can
 
06:37:30.470 --> 06:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
pick up we don't know this and we don't
 
06:37:32.628 --> 06:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
know that we don't know this but we do
 
06:37:35.570 --> 06:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
know the kids do need food and we do
 
06:37:38.990 --> 06:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
know that if we do this we'll we'll find
 
06:37:42.590 --> 06:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
those answers and at the same time we'll
 
06:37:45.110 --> 06:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
give some benefit to students so please
 
06:37:48.170 --> 06:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
don't let the the perfect perfect be the
 
06:37:51.048 --> 06:37:51.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:55.670 --> 06:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:59.628 --> 06:37:59.638 align:start position:0%
the bill does not say make sure that
 
06:38:02.030 --> 06:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
kids who don't have breakfast are
 
06:38:03.530 --> 06:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
getting breakfast
 
06:38:06.830 --> 06:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
it says that they'll be providing during
 
06:38:08.750 --> 06:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
school hours
 
06:38:12.170 --> 06:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
breakfast I mean the that it will be
 
06:38:14.208 --> 06:38:14.218 align:start position:0%
available during school hours to every
 
06:38:17.448 --> 06:38:17.458 align:start position:0%
pupil under its jurisdiction which is a
 
06:38:21.170 --> 06:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
huge thing very different than providing
 
06:38:24.548 --> 06:38:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:27.170 --> 06:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
we're talking we keep thinking of those
 
06:38:29.090 --> 06:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
kids who aren't eating at home because
 
06:38:31.430 --> 06:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
they can't they you know don't have it
 
06:38:33.170 --> 06:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
available or whatever that's not what
 
06:38:34.970 --> 06:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
this is even saying
 
06:38:37.430 --> 06:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
asking to be done they're asking that
 
06:38:39.410 --> 06:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
each school provides
 
06:38:42.230 --> 06:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
makes available to every student in the
 
06:38:44.090 --> 06:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
school whether they can eat breakfast at
 
06:38:45.170 --> 06:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
home or not
 
06:38:47.510 --> 06:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that's why I was saying as I could
 
06:38:49.670 --> 06:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
eat breakfast at home but I wouldn't
 
06:38:52.570 --> 06:38:52.580 align:start position:0%
have I would have availed myself of this
 
06:38:56.810 --> 06:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
but these schools these 27 we don't know
 
06:38:59.208 --> 06:38:59.218 align:start position:0%
that they're not providing breakfast
 
06:39:02.090 --> 06:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
to those kids who need it they're not
 
06:39:05.448 --> 06:39:05.458 align:start position:0%
providing breakfast according using the
 
06:39:07.128 --> 06:39:07.138 align:start position:0%
federal program and they may have
 
06:39:09.590 --> 06:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
determined that it costs them more
 
06:39:11.690 --> 06:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
because they have to follow all those
 
06:39:13.548 --> 06:39:13.558 align:start position:0%
guidelines which might be hiring extra
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
helpers or whatever they have to do
 
06:39:18.948 --> 06:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just doing a grab-and-go
 
06:39:20.750 --> 06:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
we don't know that they're not doing a
 
06:39:23.750 --> 06:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
grab and go we don't know that this is
 
06:39:25.070 --> 06:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
even needed
 
06:39:27.230 --> 06:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
but we know that we're expanding
 
06:39:30.288 --> 06:39:30.298 align:start position:0%
breakfast by doing this to all schools
 
06:39:32.930 --> 06:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
to all students which is very different
 
06:39:36.170 --> 06:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
than providing for kids who can't who
 
06:39:39.170 --> 06:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
don't have access to food
 
06:39:39.180 --> 06:39:40.310 align:start position:0%
don't have access to food
foreign

06:39:40.310 --> 06:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:39:43.970 --> 06:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
so the the next step is could be if
 
06:39:46.548 --> 06:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
we're required to do this we've had
 
06:39:48.948 --> 06:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
bills in here before telling us how many
 
06:39:51.948 --> 06:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
minutes we must require for the serving
 
06:39:53.750 --> 06:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
of lunch
 
06:39:56.208 --> 06:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
not including the time going to the gym
 
06:39:58.430 --> 06:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
or to the cafeteria and coming back from
 
06:39:59.810 --> 06:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria
 
06:40:01.730 --> 06:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
are we then going to have a similar
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
thing occurring for breakfast
 
06:40:06.230 --> 06:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
where you have to have so many minutes
 
06:40:09.708 --> 06:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
for a sit-down time to have breakfast
 
06:40:12.830 --> 06:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
and my concern on that would be while
 
06:40:14.330 --> 06:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
we're really now starting a Whittle into
 
06:40:16.010 --> 06:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
the academic time that we have available
 
06:40:18.530 --> 06:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
for instruction and and the days are
 
06:40:20.510 --> 06:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
already compared to other countries in
 
06:40:23.030 --> 06:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
this world very short
 
06:40:24.708 --> 06:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
maybe that could be an unintended
 
06:40:26.690 --> 06:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
consequence but maybe it never will
 
06:40:29.090 --> 06:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
happen but we've had legislation come
 
06:40:33.708 --> 06:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:36.650 --> 06:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
represent uh Damon
 
06:40:38.570 --> 06:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:40:40.670 --> 06:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
I want to clarify that the bill does not
 
06:40:43.190 --> 06:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
say that breakfast and lunch will be
 
06:40:46.368 --> 06:40:46.378 align:start position:0%
free to every people it says they will
 
06:40:48.590 --> 06:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
be served without cost or Roost trust to
 
06:40:50.150 --> 06:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
any child who meets Federal Income
 
06:40:52.368 --> 06:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
eligibility guidelines schools can and
 
06:40:54.948 --> 06:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
do charge for the meals for other
 
06:40:58.250 --> 06:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
students so we're not giving it all away
 
06:41:00.110 --> 06:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
and frankly if it takes a little more
 
06:41:02.270 --> 06:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
time they'll learn faster after they're
 
06:41:02.280 --> 06:41:05.208 align:start position:0%
time they'll learn faster after they're
fed

06:41:05.208 --> 06:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:08.690 --> 06:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher yes a very quick note
 
06:41:10.910 --> 06:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
um sometimes kids don't make the best of
 
06:41:13.490 --> 06:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
decisions I was certainly guilty the
 
06:41:15.048 --> 06:41:15.058 align:start position:0%
only way to make sure a kid doesn't have
 
06:41:16.730 --> 06:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
a soda for breakfast would be to remove
 
06:41:20.270 --> 06:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
vending machines from schools and even
 
06:41:22.070 --> 06:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
that might not totally do the trick but
 
06:41:23.690 --> 06:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in that bill that that
 
06:41:25.548 --> 06:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
would do that
 
06:41:27.948 --> 06:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
if they haven't they have to turn them
 
06:41:27.958 --> 06:41:28.910 align:start position:0%
if they haven't they have to turn them
off

06:41:28.910 --> 06:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
off
 
06:41:30.708 --> 06:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
Federal program says you have to have
 
06:41:32.510 --> 06:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
those things turned off
 
06:41:34.730 --> 06:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
and that took a long time for a lot of
 
06:41:36.170 --> 06:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
people who are getting money from these
 
06:41:39.910 --> 06:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
machines to really get it
 
06:41:42.110 --> 06:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps and dry
 
06:41:44.030 --> 06:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman how can we find
 
06:41:50.990 --> 06:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:52.850 --> 06:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
this is an early bill
 
06:41:56.208 --> 06:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
um so if we have to have by the 16th of
 
06:41:58.610 --> 06:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
this month get this out so I don't know
 
06:42:02.150 --> 06:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
if we're unless uh Rambo or somebody
 
06:42:04.128 --> 06:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
over there at the department has this
 
06:42:04.138 --> 06:42:05.930 align:start position:0%
over there at the department has this
information

06:42:05.930 --> 06:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:42:05.940 --> 06:42:06.590 align:start position:0%
information
um

06:42:06.590 --> 06:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:08.448 --> 06:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't think there's going
 
06:42:10.250 --> 06:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
to be time available right now we're
 
06:42:12.650 --> 06:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
really squeezed for time now we're gonna
 
06:42:14.510 --> 06:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
have to act on this one right off we
 
06:42:16.368 --> 06:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
can't put early bills off
 
06:42:19.250 --> 06:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
can we make phone calls
 
06:42:21.590 --> 06:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
on a Friday afternoon 410 you're not
 
06:42:22.690 --> 06:42:22.700 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
06:42:26.330 --> 06:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
not now I mean before the 15th I no
 
06:42:28.430 --> 06:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
because then we have to repost this
 
06:42:32.330 --> 06:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
thing in the calendar and nope not gonna
 
06:42:32.340 --> 06:42:36.368 align:start position:0%
thing in the calendar and nope not gonna
happen

06:42:36.368 --> 06:42:36.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:39.590 --> 06:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
inside of the fact of 456 schools
 
06:42:41.628 --> 06:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
already do it so I like to get to figure
 
06:42:43.070 --> 06:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
out how to do this it's not like 34
 
06:42:45.230 --> 06:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
can't figure this out because they are
 
06:42:46.788 --> 06:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
they already do it they already are
 
06:42:47.930 --> 06:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
06:42:49.070 --> 06:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
um the school schedule is going to be
 
06:42:51.470 --> 06:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
figured out because 456 out of almost
 
06:42:53.690 --> 06:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
500 are already doing it it's not that
 
06:42:55.788 --> 06:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
hard I was just giving those kids an
 
06:42:57.788 --> 06:42:57.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's as simple as that
 
06:43:00.288 --> 06:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
simple as that
 
06:43:02.570 --> 06:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:43:04.430 --> 06:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
not seeing any
 
06:43:07.490 --> 06:43:07.500 align:start position:0%

06:44:12.128 --> 06:44:12.138 align:start position:0%

uh Ellison makes the motion and I have
 
06:44:18.890 --> 06:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
him in Woodcock makes the second this or
 
06:44:22.788 --> 06:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
and it's uh I was to pass I have an
 
06:44:24.650 --> 06:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
amendment as well
 
06:44:27.230 --> 06:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
we gotta you know get her getting
 
06:44:29.208 --> 06:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
squared away I understand when we get to
 
06:44:32.090 --> 06:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:36.350 --> 06:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we're into that uh uh maker the
 
06:44:37.910 --> 06:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
motion do you have
 
06:44:37.920 --> 06:44:39.288 align:start position:0%
motion do you have
a comment

06:44:39.288 --> 06:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
06:44:43.128 --> 06:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
uh yes I I think this bill this bill is
 
06:44:45.470 --> 06:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
a small step of an important step in
 
06:44:49.430 --> 06:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
feeding kids in the State uh for me it's
 
06:44:53.030 --> 06:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
a no-brainer uh what comes through the
 
06:44:55.128 --> 06:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
literature or you see it everywhere is
 
06:44:57.830 --> 06:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know you can't learn Calculus if
 
06:44:58.850 --> 06:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
you're hungry
 
06:45:01.010 --> 06:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
and you just put in whatever you want in
 
06:45:03.530 --> 06:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
there you can't learn social studies if
 
06:45:06.410 --> 06:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
you're hungry so I feel very strongly
 
06:45:08.390 --> 06:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is an important bill in general
 
06:45:08.400 --> 06:45:09.350 align:start position:0%
this is an important bill in general
point

06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:45:12.650 --> 06:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any discussion from
 
06:45:16.548 --> 06:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
the maker the second yes I would uh I
 
06:45:17.690 --> 06:45:17.700 align:start position:0%

you you did the second on on the
 
06:47:48.770 --> 06:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
amendment as well okay I was just trying
 
06:47:50.270 --> 06:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure we had it all down right
 
06:47:50.280 --> 06:47:53.868 align:start position:0%

okay
 
06:47:57.948 --> 06:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
um would you like to go through this and
 
06:47:59.270 --> 06:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
take us through the numbers here please
 
06:48:04.150 --> 06:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:19.510 --> 06:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:22.850 --> 06:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amendment itself uh I
 
06:48:25.310 --> 06:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned this earlier but it basically
 
06:48:28.670 --> 06:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
includes charter schools for the bill uh
 
06:48:31.448 --> 06:48:31.458 align:start position:0%
changes in the effective date to July 1
 
06:48:35.208 --> 06:48:35.218 align:start position:0%
2024 and it puts a waiver provision in
 
06:48:37.610 --> 06:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
for school districts that might want to
 
06:48:41.208 --> 06:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
run their programs their own program
 
06:48:43.250 --> 06:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
as long as they meet the two
 
06:48:43.260 --> 06:48:46.190 align:start position:0%
as long as they meet the two
requirements

06:48:46.190 --> 06:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:48.590 --> 06:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
Federal breakfast and lunch program one
 
06:48:51.110 --> 06:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
is the influential guidelines and two
 
06:48:54.590 --> 06:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
the income guidelines we did try to dig
 
06:48:56.570 --> 06:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
around and see how many school districts
 
06:48:58.070 --> 06:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't answer this question
 
06:49:00.830 --> 06:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
about which six districts aren't doing
 
06:49:03.110 --> 06:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
this but we found out that that Handler
 
06:49:05.390 --> 06:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
runs its own program okay it will runs
 
06:49:07.610 --> 06:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
its own program but they do meet all
 
06:49:08.990 --> 06:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
that they meet the requirements but
 
06:49:11.150 --> 06:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
there they do not participate in this
 
06:49:12.468 --> 06:49:12.478 align:start position:0%
program I guess at some point
 
06:49:14.390 --> 06:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
Londonderry was there but I think that
 
06:49:17.990 --> 06:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
was changed uh but that is that's all
 
06:49:19.730 --> 06:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
the individual information we could get
 
06:49:23.030 --> 06:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
on individual school districts
 
06:49:26.750 --> 06:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay it's a number one uh
 
06:49:31.190 --> 06:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
so it it cleans it up and sense of you
 
06:49:35.150 --> 06:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
know going forward uh what we we talked
 
06:49:37.430 --> 06:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
about at Charter School uh directors
 
06:49:41.330 --> 06:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
about issues and providing meals and
 
06:49:44.030 --> 06:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
those programs are all over the lot some
 
06:49:46.310 --> 06:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
are having everything brought in some
 
06:49:47.990 --> 06:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
have few have kitchens they're doing
 
06:49:51.010 --> 06:49:51.020 align:start position:0%
their own most of them are contracted or
 
06:49:55.190 --> 06:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
lunches some for breakfast uh and in
 
06:49:57.230 --> 06:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
that full issue around Charters and
 
06:50:00.410 --> 06:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
feeding students needs a lot more
 
06:50:03.288 --> 06:50:03.298 align:start position:0%
sort of research and discussion you can
 
06:50:05.810 --> 06:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:08.510 --> 06:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
think that we would go forward with in
 
06:50:10.910 --> 06:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
the next year because we have so bad as
 
06:50:10.920 --> 06:50:12.890 align:start position:0%
the next year because we have so bad as
what

06:50:12.890 --> 06:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:50:17.270 --> 06:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
um my goal in filing the bill
 
06:50:20.090 --> 06:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh filing the amendment is to feed more
 
06:50:24.410 --> 06:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:26.448 --> 06:50:26.458 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:50:29.930 --> 06:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh do you have anything to say in the
 
06:50:32.150 --> 06:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
second reps of Woodcock no sir thank you
 
06:50:34.310 --> 06:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
06:50:36.708 --> 06:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
foreign first I wanted to make it clear
 
06:50:39.230 --> 06:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
that I did eat breakfast
 
06:50:41.570 --> 06:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
even though I would have taken advantage
 
06:50:43.190 --> 06:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the school breakfast I did eat
 
06:50:43.200 --> 06:50:44.868 align:start position:0%
of the school breakfast I did eat
breakfast

06:50:44.868 --> 06:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
breakfast
 
06:50:44.878 --> 06:50:45.910 align:start position:0%
breakfast
um

06:50:45.910 --> 06:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:49.250 --> 06:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the assumptions a number
 
06:50:52.610 --> 06:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
of things the assumptions on the
 
06:50:52.620 --> 06:50:54.590 align:start position:0%
of things the assumptions on the
um

06:50:54.590 --> 06:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:57.770 --> 06:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is basically any school
 
06:51:00.530 --> 06:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
not operating the SBP is not serving
 
06:51:00.540 --> 06:51:02.030 align:start position:0%
not operating the SBP is not serving
breakfast

06:51:02.030 --> 06:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
breakfast
 
06:51:05.150 --> 06:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
we have no idea if that's true or not
 
06:51:08.270 --> 06:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
any school not operating the nslp is not
 
06:51:10.610 --> 06:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
serving lunch we know that's not true
 
06:51:13.208 --> 06:51:13.218 align:start position:0%
Londonderry did
 
06:51:16.850 --> 06:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
decided not to participate in in the
 
06:51:18.590 --> 06:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
federal lunch program because the kids
 
06:51:20.270 --> 06:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
weren't eating the food and they were
 
06:51:21.590 --> 06:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
throwing it away
 
06:51:23.930 --> 06:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
and so they decided they weren't going
 
06:51:25.070 --> 06:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
to do that they weren't going to take
 
06:51:26.270 --> 06:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
the federal money they were going to
 
06:51:28.070 --> 06:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
provide their own stuff
 
06:51:30.288 --> 06:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
they are providing food kids are eating
 
06:51:32.208 --> 06:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
lunch and they're much happier
 
06:51:36.890 --> 06:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
so that's an incorrect assumption
 
06:51:36.900 --> 06:51:38.690 align:start position:0%
so that's an incorrect assumption
um

06:51:38.690 --> 06:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:42.708 --> 06:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
and then downward talks about
 
06:51:45.468 --> 06:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
um the money yeah they made an estimate
 
06:51:47.708 --> 06:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
of the money but that's for the state
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
implementation that has nothing to do
 
06:51:54.230 --> 06:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the locals so it's still
 
06:51:56.330 --> 06:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
um an unfunded mandate because there's
 
06:51:58.968 --> 06:51:58.978 align:start position:0%
no money in here for the towns and the
 
06:52:01.850 --> 06:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
additional cost to provide breakfast
 
06:52:05.030 --> 06:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
make it available to every student in
 
06:52:07.548 --> 06:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
the school as opposed to just those who
 
06:52:09.110 --> 06:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
are going hungry
 
06:52:12.948 --> 06:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's that number is just what the doe
 
06:52:15.170 --> 06:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
and whoever
 
06:52:18.410 --> 06:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
people departments in the state have to
 
06:52:21.170 --> 06:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
deal with running the this program it's
 
06:52:23.570 --> 06:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
not how much it costs these local
 
06:52:23.580 --> 06:52:26.930 align:start position:0%
not how much it costs these local
schools

06:52:26.930 --> 06:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:26.940 --> 06:52:28.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:52:28.610 --> 06:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:30.288 --> 06:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
I think there was one more thing that
 
06:52:32.570 --> 06:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing it right now
 
06:52:32.580 --> 06:52:35.090 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing it right now
um

06:52:35.090 --> 06:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:37.250 --> 06:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
I guess you know the fact that we're
 
06:52:39.830 --> 06:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
mandating now that every school
 
06:52:43.730 --> 06:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
provides lunch to every student and oh I
 
06:52:46.010 --> 06:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
know what it was well you're assuming
 
06:52:47.208 --> 06:52:47.218 align:start position:0%
that well they're going to make money
 
06:52:49.190 --> 06:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
and it's going to come back but didn't
 
06:52:51.770 --> 06:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
we just have a discussion about school a
 
06:52:53.690 --> 06:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
school lunch programs running in the red
 
06:52:55.968 --> 06:52:55.978 align:start position:0%
and having problems collecting the money
 
06:52:58.190 --> 06:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
and all of that wasn't that one of our
 
06:53:00.288 --> 06:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
bills that we just talked about
 
06:53:00.298 --> 06:53:01.548 align:start position:0%
bills that we just talked about
so

06:53:01.548 --> 06:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:53:03.170 --> 06:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
you know we can't even make that
 
06:53:04.730 --> 06:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
assumption that because we're selling
 
06:53:04.740 --> 06:53:05.628 align:start position:0%
assumption that because we're selling
lunch

06:53:05.628 --> 06:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
06:53:08.750 --> 06:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
now it's going to pay for itself
 
06:53:11.390 --> 06:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
when we already know there's an issue in
 
06:53:13.670 --> 06:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
some schools that their programs are
 
06:53:15.170 --> 06:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
running in the red so now we're going to
 
06:53:18.410 --> 06:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
ask them to run in the red more I mean I
 
06:53:20.330 --> 06:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
am very much for making sure kids have
 
06:53:20.340 --> 06:53:21.170 align:start position:0%
am very much for making sure kids have
food

06:53:21.170 --> 06:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
food
 
06:53:24.410 --> 06:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
I am very much for having the local the
 
06:53:26.930 --> 06:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
school approach some one of the local
 
06:53:26.940 --> 06:53:28.910 align:start position:0%
school approach some one of the local
um

06:53:28.910 --> 06:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:30.708 --> 06:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
what Farms
 
06:53:34.250 --> 06:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
well Farms or or
 
06:53:36.170 --> 06:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
um other local facilities that provide
 
06:53:38.468 --> 06:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
breakfast and donating
 
06:53:40.548 --> 06:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
breakfasts for those kids who aren't
 
06:53:42.468 --> 06:53:42.478 align:start position:0%
eating breakfast and maybe that's what
 
06:53:44.690 --> 06:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
these kids these schools these 27 are
 
06:53:46.548 --> 06:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
doing we don't know
 
06:53:49.010 --> 06:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
I love voluntary you know feeding of
 
06:53:51.708 --> 06:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
kids but mandating not just feeding the
 
06:53:53.570 --> 06:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
kids who aren't eating but feeding the
 
06:53:55.310 --> 06:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
kids who are eating which is what we're
 
06:53:57.170 --> 06:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
mandating here
 
06:54:00.288 --> 06:54:00.298 align:start position:0%
it uh represent Belcher thank you Mr
 
06:54:03.230 --> 06:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
chair just to follow up on reply us and
 
06:54:04.850 --> 06:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
the the idea that we have an unfunded
 
06:54:06.468 --> 06:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
mandate here I'd like to look at the
 
06:54:09.048 --> 06:54:09.058 align:start position:0%
waiver procedure here for a moment
 
06:54:12.048 --> 06:54:12.058 align:start position:0%
so we can grant a waiver to a school to
 
06:54:13.430 --> 06:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
not have to participate in national
 
06:54:15.948 --> 06:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
school lunch program or whether the
 
06:54:18.110 --> 06:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
school breakfast program
 
06:54:20.030 --> 06:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
um to implement its own policy but that
 
06:54:22.128 --> 06:54:22.138 align:start position:0%
policy still must comply with the income
 
06:54:24.708 --> 06:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
guidelines and still must provide free
 
06:54:27.590 --> 06:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
and reduced priced lunch and breakfast
 
06:54:27.600 --> 06:54:28.810 align:start position:0%
and reduced priced lunch and breakfast
so

06:54:28.810 --> 06:54:28.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:54:31.670 --> 06:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
if they're not being reimbursed by the
 
06:54:33.048 --> 06:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
federal government because they're not a
 
06:54:34.730 --> 06:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
part of the program and we've given them
 
06:54:36.650 --> 06:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
a waiver for it but they're still
 
06:54:38.868 --> 06:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
providing that for free where is the
 
06:54:40.010 --> 06:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
money coming from because we're not
 
06:54:41.448 --> 06:54:41.458 align:start position:0%
providing it that sounds like an
 
06:54:43.788 --> 06:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate
 
06:54:45.770 --> 06:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
 
06:54:45.780 --> 06:54:47.208 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
committee

06:54:47.208 --> 06:54:47.218 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:54:49.070 --> 06:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock thank you
 
06:54:50.510 --> 06:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
not a question just a reference to
 
06:54:53.150 --> 06:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
Senate uh like this the first two
 
06:54:55.368 --> 06:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
assumptions that you said are incorrect
 
06:54:57.110 --> 06:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're just they're just
 
06:54:59.208 --> 06:54:59.218 align:start position:0%
overarching assumptions at least they're
 
06:55:02.390 --> 06:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
not incorrect a school operating the SBP
 
06:55:04.730 --> 06:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
did not serve any breakfast that's not
 
06:55:06.708 --> 06:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
an assumption that's a fact the school
 
06:55:08.330 --> 06:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
law operating a life is not serving
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
lunch that's a pretty simple fact you're
 
06:55:11.690 --> 06:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
not serving you're not serving that
 
06:55:12.830 --> 06:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's something to base the rest of the
 
06:55:14.990 --> 06:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
stuff on so they aren't incorrect
 
06:55:15.000 --> 06:55:16.490 align:start position:0%
stuff on so they aren't incorrect
assumptions

06:55:16.490 --> 06:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
assumptions
 
06:55:18.110 --> 06:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:55:19.548 --> 06:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
for a further question yes
 
06:55:21.830 --> 06:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald I appreciate you
 
06:55:23.390 --> 06:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
saying that representative Woodcock but
 
06:55:25.250 --> 06:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
I would like to counter that because as
 
06:55:27.048 --> 06:55:27.058 align:start position:0%
it says on this fiscal note that was
 
06:55:29.090 --> 06:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
updated and provided to all of us the
 
06:55:31.070 --> 06:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
National School breakfast program is the
 
06:55:34.190 --> 06:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
acronym SBP and the first assumption is
 
06:55:36.650 --> 06:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
any school not operating the national
 
06:55:38.810 --> 06:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
breakfast program is not serving
 
06:55:40.250 --> 06:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
breakfast so therefore maybe they're
 
06:55:41.810 --> 06:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
operating in a way that's not federally
 
06:55:43.730 --> 06:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
regulated you mentioned that maybe the
 
06:55:45.048 --> 06:55:45.058 align:start position:0%
Londonderry school did that at some
 
06:55:47.990 --> 06:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
point or maybe Hanover does that now so
 
06:55:49.968 --> 06:55:49.978 align:start position:0%
that is not a correct assumption to make
 
06:55:51.770 --> 06:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
so that would say that there's an
 
06:55:53.930 --> 06:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
inaccuracy in this paperwork and that
 
06:55:55.310 --> 06:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
the rest of the claims that are based
 
06:55:56.990 --> 06:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
off those assumptions would be subject
 
06:55:59.510 --> 06:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
to the inaccuracy as well
 
06:56:02.510 --> 06:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:04.968 --> 06:56:04.978 align:start position:0%

10 years 10 knees
 
06:58:47.150 --> 06:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
so who's running the minority or the one
 
06:58:48.890 --> 06:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
side the
 
06:58:51.530 --> 06:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
OTP side and the itl
 
06:58:54.468 --> 06:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
and the iql representative Drive where
 
06:58:57.350 --> 06:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to write the uh
 
06:59:04.250 --> 06:59:04.260 align:start position:0%

I mean there wasn't a there was an
 
06:59:15.410 --> 06:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
emotion or a second name right
 
06:59:15.420 --> 06:59:53.090 align:start position:0%
emotion or a second name right
foreign

06:59:53.090 --> 06:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:53.100 --> 06:59:54.590 align:start position:0%

06:59:54.590 --> 06:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
06:59:56.930 --> 06:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
you can offer a floor Amendment but
 
06:59:59.510 --> 06:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's no otpa but here because that
 
07:00:01.670 --> 07:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
was not approved the other one which we
 
07:00:04.310 --> 07:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
had it was approved remember eleven nine
 
07:00:07.310 --> 07:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
so this one was not approved so it would
 
07:00:09.530 --> 07:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
have to be a floor Amendment and the OTP
 
07:00:13.070 --> 07:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
he can speak to what occurred during the
 
07:00:17.030 --> 07:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
meeting and saying yes and yeah these
 
07:00:19.628 --> 07:00:19.638 align:start position:0%
are the three areas which we're
 
07:00:22.850 --> 07:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
recommending that change right
 
07:00:26.868 --> 07:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
but um well like like when when we um
 
07:00:29.150 --> 07:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
let's say a
 
07:00:29.160 --> 07:00:31.010 align:start position:0%
let's say a
emotion

07:00:31.010 --> 07:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
emotion
 
07:00:34.010 --> 07:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
with I mean let's say there was a
 
07:00:36.530 --> 07:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
majority report in minority and The
