00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh let's see how we get started this um
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
this as as some of you might know that
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh technically uh the science and
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
technology has our committee room for
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays uh and but I like to oh Bob you
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
new so um this this actually this room
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
it brings back kind of fun memory
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
because the original Commerce Committee
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
was 207 the room Bo hello so the same
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
views of the window same same cozy space
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
this is brings back memories from me um
 
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
but having said that um I would say that
 
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
um we will still continue the policy of
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
the commerence committee that every
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
every bill will have a subcommittee will
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
go to subcommittee so as you can see
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
today these are liquor bills these will
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
be liquor subcommittee and um given that
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a flux of bills
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
coming in and little transition uh next
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
week I think we'll just schedule the
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh for these two bills next
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
week it will not be on a Tuesday because
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
I will be in Pittsburgh and some people
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
imagine okay so we'll open up the public
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on house spill 242 relative to
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
brew pub licenses oh this is my
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
bill uh Scott why don't you come up and
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
about good morning for the record my
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
name is Scott Shire I work for the New
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire beer distributors Association
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd be happy to sort of give a
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
recap would you like the short version
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
or the long
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
version why don't you give the whole
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
story and that way we can okay okay so
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
essentially um for those of you who have
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
been here before you understand the
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
basics of the three- tier system and for
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
those of you who don't I'll give you the
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
real quick primer um following the
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
repeal of prohibition the federal
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
government gave States their rights to
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
regulate alcohol in the way that they
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
see fit and uh in Most states there was
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
a three- tier system developed
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
wherein suppliers had separation from
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
Distributors and retailers so that they
 
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have somebody monopolizing the
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
market for instance uh back in the days
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
before prohibition somebody large like a
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
Schlitz for example might own their own
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
bars and also do their own distribution
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
wherein they could take their products
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
and sell them for cheap and drive
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
competitors out of the marketplace and
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the process you know encourage
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
intoxication Etc while um some people
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
might have been fans of that most people
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
weren't and following prohibition the
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
three-tier system was set up so there's
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
a separation between a producer or a
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
brewer in this case or a Venter um a
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
Wholesale Distributor or a broker and
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
then a retailer with the exception here
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire of the State Liquor
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
Commission who acts as both the
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
distributor and the retailer so there
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
there is as representative hunt likes to
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
say one huge uh you know exception in
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
the in the state of New Hampshire to the
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
three- tier system there are also some
 
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
other smaller exceptions um small
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
Brewers are allowed to self-distribute
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
up to 00 barrels um and then Wineries
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
and distilleries also have similar
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions um on their distribution
 
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
volumetric restrictions so anyway this
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
this bill in particular came up because
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
one restaurant lensey who wanted to open
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
a brewery but they had common ownership
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
with other restaurants already and
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's a Prohibition of three- tier you
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
can't have cross tier ownership so this
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
particular Restaurant Group had half a
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
dozen to 10 other restaurants already
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
they bought a facility that had a
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
brewing uh previously had brewing in
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
there and decided they wanted to brew
 
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do it they looked at
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
several different options and then they
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
went to the Liquor Commission and came
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
up with this potential fix for it um
 
00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:12.519 align:start position:0%
everything was uh was sort of in
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
agreement with the industry after some
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
wrangling and uh in a couple of hearings
 
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
last year we agreed on language and
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately at the end of the session
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
there was a clerical error and uh the
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
wrong language was adopted and passed so
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
we're here to basically adopt the right
 
00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
language and correct what happened at
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
out I like your phraseology and maybe
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
you should we'll hear the other side
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
their testimony to sure but otherwise
 
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
you are in support of the bill as we are
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill as presented yes
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%

legislative session uh he referenced a
 
00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:17.759 align:start position:0%
clerical error uh I think this cleans up

liquor enforcement
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
licensing um Matt Matt will uh talk
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
about some of the technical notes in
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
this but I think uh for those of us that
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
were here last uh last session
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
um my two predecessors here um have
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
testified both Scott Mike um very
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
eloquently on on what transposed um we
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
we are in the same position as everybody
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
else this fixes a a clerical error um
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
that uh at the time Senator Bradley was
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
trying to fix uh before he retired so um
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
with that in mind I'll I'll give the
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
microphone over to uh
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
Matt thank you very much um
 
00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:01.959 align:start position:0%
the the popup license uh is a license
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
that requires not only has the
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
manufacturing but it also requires a on
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
premise restaurant it's one of the only
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturing licenses that does that so
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
the whole consideration of the croser
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
system was done specifically in the Brew
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
Pub license this doesn't apply to the
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
other manufacturing licenses Only The
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
Brew Pub the fix in House Bill 242 is
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
simply focused around the distribution
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
the distribution of that Brew Pub
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturing their own beverage and
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
distributing it to now their their um
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
authorized on or off premise licenses
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
licenses um and it limits that to the
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
quantity stated before the 200 uh 2500
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
barrels and it only um allows them to
 
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
self-distribute to one of those
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
licenses otherwise they have to go
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
through the Wholesale Distributors add
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
system any questions from the committee
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
members I just realized we only have one
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
new member
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
here but do you know some of your new
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
ntion members are they do they let you
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
know they're coming or do they yeah okay
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
because I was kind of hoping this would
 
00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.669 align:start position:0%
because I was kind of hoping this would
be

00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
educational but uh but
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh obviously from the old all the other
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
older members of the committee know they
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
know what's going on and the new member
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
he's just getting up to speed here
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much you okay so uh
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
for the for the take-home uh
 
00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919 align:start position:0%
representative pressent is that uh brew
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
pubs is uh are an outlier of
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
lenses to all our other liquor
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
lenses uh and they uh as Mr sh pointed
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
out um they they trample on the three
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
here not just slightly but
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly trample on it uh and I
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
will make sure you know this because all
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the other committee this passed before I
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
got here as much as people like to talk
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
that how long I've been here I did not
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with the uh Brew Pub
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
lure but uh it did get p and it is
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
something that we we deal
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
with with that I will close the public
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on house Bell 242
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
and since I only scheduled 15 minutes
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're ready for the next one uh open up
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and House Bill 81
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
allowing patrons to take purchased
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol beverages into the restroom of a
 
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.510 align:start position:0%
alcohol beverages into the restroom of a
restaurant

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't think we've ever we I
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
don't think we've ever we've had this
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
conversation before so representative
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
sullon will fill out a pin card later I
 
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.830 align:start position:0%
sullon will fill out a pin card later I
sure

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
will um hello everybody most people here
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
know me I guess I don't think I've told
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
me that you yet um okay yeah so this
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
bill is pretty simple right now it's
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
illegal to take your beverage with you
 
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
into a restroom if you're at a bar or
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
restaurant and while it seems like kind
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
of a trivial thing not a big deal I
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what the reasoning is
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
I've been told it was probably to keep
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
underage people from getting alcohol um
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
handoffs in the bathroom I I think it's
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
important that we allow people to be in
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
charge of their drinks at all times and
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
so this the motivation of this comes
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
from a pretty heavy story where a an
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
incredibly close friend of mine uh one
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
of my one of my best
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
friends one of my one of my best friends
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh one of my really close friends was um
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
ruied rufi in a bar and woke up in a in
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
a hotel room that wasn't there as
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
clearly had been raped and to me it just
 
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
seems like you know when I was in
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
college there was a problem with
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
people's drinks being drugged at at uh
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
fat houses and there was a big campaign
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
at my my callers saying always be in
 
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
charge of your your own drink always be
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
in control of your alcohol that sort of
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
stuff and this runs counter to that I
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
didn't really I learned about this law
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
from working on this committee um and I
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
think actually representative Hunt is
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
the one who who told me about this at
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
one point and um and I didn't really
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
think too much about it and because i'
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
never actually heard anybody enforcing
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
it or anything like that but then I did
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
see in Manchester a bar was out over the
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
summer that actually had a had a a sign
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
on the door saying you're not allowed to
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
bring your your alcoholic beverage into
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
the bathroom and so to me it just seems
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
like common sense that if we don't want
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
people to potentially um you know
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
particularly if they're a little under
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
the influence they just bought a drink
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
they have to go use the restroom they
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
put it down and that opens up the
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to for something something
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
bad had to happen and um and then just
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
from talking to this I you know just
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
very recently I was talking about this
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill that I'm going to be testifying on
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
today and a family member told me that
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
that uh she was she was roofied in in a
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
bar um probably 15 years ago which I had
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
no idea about until just talking about
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
this so these things happen and we
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
people should be in charge of their own
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
drinks and we don't want to make it an
 
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity easier for somebody to
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
potentially uh take advantage of
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
somebody who is
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
um putting their drink down to abide by
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
a law and uh so that's uh that's the
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
motivation behind it so take any
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
questions if you want
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
it so you you do know that the reason
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
why the law was passed in the first
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
place is because people were taking
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
drinks into the bathrooms and spiking
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
them yes that I was told that it could
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
be that or or the fear of that or the
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
fear of uh handing them off to underage
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
people correct but yeah I I I was told I
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
think you and I think somebody else told
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
me that the motivation behind it was to
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
get uh or to take away the ability to
 
00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know buy a a vodka soda and then add
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
more vodka to it or whatever um I mean I
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
would I would think that that that's
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
possible I I'm I'm more concerned about
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
somebody waking up in a hotel room after
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
being raped which is what happened to my
 
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.149 align:start position:0%
being raped which is what happened to my
close

00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
close
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
friend right I I hope the person who did
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
it get was found out and prosecuted nope
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
uh they woke up in an empty hotel room
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
that wasn't theirs and don't
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
know never found out who the who the who
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
the as salent was did this occur in New
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no it did not occur in New
 
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.710 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no it did not occur in New
Hampshire

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
okay because most hotels have cameras
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
and they would see who's coming into
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
this was this was like 20 years ago yeah
 
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.269 align:start position:0%
this was this was like 20 years ago yeah
okay

00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
so uh any other questions from the
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
committee members yes we have to hit
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
your button
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
so my question is uh who is responsible
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
if the drink is taken to the restroom
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
and they do something the hotel is
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for that or because that's
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
not under the supervision of the any of
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
the staff of the hotel
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
restaurant so your question is if
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
somebody were to take a a beverage into
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
the bathroom and
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
then yeah they do something on their own
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
I mean that would be on on on them I
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
would how we prove
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
that no no be be careful when you do
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
that so you're you you're asking a
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
question and then you let him response
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
okay sorry and then you look to me and
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
say further question thank you I'm
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
learning okay I know I realized this
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
your first day with representative hun
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fine
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean I would
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
say who who would be responsible now I
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
mean there there's a law now how would
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
you how would you prove that right like
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
so if if you are
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
taking if you if the fear is that I'm
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
coming in with a little bottle of vodka
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
in my pocket and I'm going to bring it
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
into the bathroom and add it to drinks I
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
could also drink that in the bathroom as
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
well like if if somebody's going to do
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
that then there's really no way to truly
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
monitor that um I think the way that the
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
restaurant would be potentially
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
responsible as if the person was clearly
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
very intoxicated and they continued to
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
sell them drinks but um I don't think if
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
they sold them one drink and that person
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
was you know milking that drink and keep
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
eating adding their own I there's
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
evidence that they only sold them one
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
drink I think that that would should be
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
able to protect the the bar owner
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
because they would say hey we we only
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
sold them one drink so something else
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
happened they either were drinking
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
illegally in the bathroom or somewhere
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
else with alcohol they didn't purchase
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
from us or they um were leaving and
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
coming back like whatever the reasons
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
are um so I I I think we we know we know
 
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
that the the responsibility is on the
 
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
bartender and the establishment to not
 
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
overs serve people if they only served
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
one drink then presumably they should be
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
able to kind of prove that they have
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
receipts from what they sold
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay right I I my I assume the question
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
is is in terms of whatever act that was
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
committed inside let's say you've given
 
00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:24.039 align:start position:0%
it to a minor right or giving having a
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
spike in the drink it got so spiked to
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
the point where they were became intoxic
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
ated now the onus is on the
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant because if that person walks
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
out and the liquor enforcement sees that
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
person and the person I assume will deny
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
they did anything in the bathroom of
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
course and so therefore now the
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
restaurant is
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
liable for uh that person being drunk
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
right and I think that's what he's going
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
with that question I got his I got his
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
intent and I think that I think I just
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
answered it I mean if if The Liquor
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
Commission would come and I'm sure
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
they'll speak after me and they can
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
explain what their their process to
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
investigate this would be but presumably
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
they would look at it and say well
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that that they
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
actually over served him they served him
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
one alcoholic beverage or two alcoholic
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
beverages if they had you know if you
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
show up and if I show up at a bar and
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
they show they serve me 10 and then I do
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
something then they're going to find
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
that out but I mean if if he's been
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
served one or two
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
drinks and somehow is so drunk that you
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
know there's there's a serious problem
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
presumably the El commission would be
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
able to kind of figure that out by
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
looking at receipts and I mean I know
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's an investigation right
 
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.029 align:start position:0%
there's an investigation right
there

00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay yep representative
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
pelli yes thank you for taking my
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
question so would the um uh restaurant
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
or the uh establishment owner have the
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
ability to not enforce this policy is it
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
voluntary so I could see a lot of issues
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
where the restaurant owner would say you
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
know there's cleanliness issues there's
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't I can't monitor
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
anything you know it's not enforcable so
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
would the restaurant owner be able to
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
say I'm I'm not going to um allow this
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
policy thank you sure yeah of course no
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
this is not forcing them to say You must
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
allow everybody to take their alcoholic
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
beverages into the bathroom if they
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that then they have a
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
right to set their own policies I'm just
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
trying to enable restaurants
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
to not put up signs up there if they
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to um to allow people to make
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
that allow the The Establishment to make
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
their own choices um but yeah this is
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
not requiring them to allow people to
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
take whatever they want into the
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
bathroom that that's they want to make
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
their own policy they can but right now
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
the policy is that you can't and I want
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
to allow restaurants to not have to have
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
that policy by
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
law so it's enabling for the
 
00:28:57.559 --> 00:28:59.230 align:start position:0%
law so it's enabling for the
establishment

00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.149 align:start position:0%
establishment
representative

00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
Herbert I'm I'm under the impression
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
it's not legal to go into the bathroom
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
with right that is currently legal
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
that's the current so you you can't do
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
this right and so I'm trying to this
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh maybe I missed uh the beginning part
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
of it uh what and so you might have
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
rrate what what's the advantage of uh
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
allowing in in the room yeah it's not
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
necess an advantage of having it in
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
there I mean it's just I think when you
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
are when you when you have an alcoholic
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
beverage you should be in control of
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
that alcoholic beverage at all time and
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
so if you're somebody who's at the
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
restaurant and or the bar and you buy a
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
drink and then you need to use a
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
restroom if you you can't take it with
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
you then it it it it gives an
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity for somebody to take
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
advantage and and Spike the drink with a
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
drug and so I don't know if you heard
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
the story but I have a very close friend
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
who woke up after having only one drink
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
at at a bar and woke up in a in a hotel
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
room and had clearly been raped and
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
there was nobody in there and so um that
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
was the motivation behind this when I
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
discovered that this was the current
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
state of the law I just think that you
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
should be in charge of your own beverage
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
at all times to try to minimize chances
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
of things like that happening
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
you mean somebody can put something so
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
this is the part where you turn to me
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
okay and say I have a further question
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
so I have follow question yes you may
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
proceed so is the liability of the
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant same if the drink is being
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
done in the in the restaurant versus in
 
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.909 align:start position:0%
done in the in the restaurant versus in
the

00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
restroom the liability yeah uh I mean I
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's I think I think
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
the the reason the law is it is
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
currently in place is because they were
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
a fearful of people buying a drink and
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
then adding more alcohol to it and so my
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
my my solution to that would be or not
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
solution but my explanation how they
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
would deal with that is if there was
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
some sort of a concern that somebody was
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
over served there would be an
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
investigation as there always is by The
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission if there's an issue
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
and they would see that they either were
 
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
overs served or they weren't over served
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know if you only bought one drink
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
and you were drunk enough that looked
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
like you had 10 drinks then that's
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
that's obviously not on the restaurant
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
something else else was going on um we
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
also know
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
that I don't know how effective this
 
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
policy is at preventing that I mean I
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
have spoken to several restaurant and
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
bar owners in the state who have told me
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
that every night they find nips in the
 
00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
trash of bathroom so I mean you know
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're either drinking them or they're
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
you know I just think it you know it
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
probably isn't it probably isn't
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
effective at achieving that goal as is
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
but I don't think the liability would
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
suddenly shift to the the restaurant
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
because I think you know just because
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
you leave someplace drunk there's going
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
to be an investigation if something
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
happened and the Liquor Commission is
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
capable of of doing a thorough
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
investigation and looking at how many
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
drinks were served or whatever to make
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
law great one one last follow uh we
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't let too many but uh we'll let you
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
have one more but if it's a quickie
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
right yeah quick so I feel that if they
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
take the drink in the back B they can
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
also misused by they can put the drug
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
now see that is I'm glad you did that
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
because that's what you cannot say
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
because you're saying I think okay so
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
what we do we have a policy is that if
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
you were going to go down this pipe you
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
would say would you believe okay okay
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I think okay but
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
in general the purpose of these hearings
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
is just to gather information we're not
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
into an interrog ation you'll have
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to tell us what you think
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
when we get into the full committee and
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work but but in the
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
hearing we generally don't want to hear
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
you okay representative pusc thank you
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for your
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
testimony representative uh thank you
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh case in point
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
if somebody bought a soft drink at the
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
establishment and took it into the
 
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
bathroom and took their little nip of
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
vodka threw it into the drink th threw
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
it into the can or or glass of soda uh
 
00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:43.710 align:start position:0%
it into the can or or glass of soda uh
would

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill have any ramification with
 
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
that I mean presumably not it's already
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
illegal to consume alcoholic beverages
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
that are not bought at that
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
establishment in the establishment so
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
somebody's breaking the law in that case
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
and that seems like since you're allowed
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any prohibition on
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
bringing a a Coke or Pepsi into the
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
bathroom and then spiking it with I
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
Don't Know Jack Daniels or whatever um
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
you know I mean if somebody's going to
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
try to do it they're going to they're
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do that so I think I
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
think the while I understand the intent
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
of the current prohibition on this I
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's actually all that
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
effective because you just found you
 
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
just laid out a really easy way that I
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
could have nip in my pocket and Spike a
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
a Coke that I just bought and there's no
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
prohibition of bringing that coke in
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
there because technically it was sold
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
without alcohol um somebody can correct
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong that you can't bring any
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
drinks in into the into into restrooms
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that that is the law
 
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
and so you cannot bring any alcohol into
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
an alcohol license establishment right
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to break the law and
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
bring alcohol into an alcoholics that
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
you bought somewhere else into the
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
establishment then this prohibition I
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
doubt is going to prevent somebody from
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
from spiking or whatever where fearful
 
00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:04.190 align:start position:0%
from spiking or whatever where fearful
of

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
happening thank you very much all right
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
thanks I seemingly have no pink cards
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
here so I assume there might be people
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
have opinions ah okay so this is another
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
rookie mistake right when you see those
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
pink cards you want to make sure you get
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
them this is good this is a good
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
orientation this is good have to
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
remember this when we doing orientation
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
this is great okay whatever that is okay
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so Mike
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
iume which one which Bill are we doing
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
on good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
the committee for the rec again for the
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mike Summers president
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
CEO of the New Hampshire lodging and
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association um we have a
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
great deal of concern with this proposal
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
um for all the issues that you really
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
just kind of baned around um obviously
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
um I respectfully disagree that I think
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
that by allowing uh alcoholic beverages
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
to be taken into the bath bathroom on
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
top of the illicit things that are
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
happening I think really does raise the
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
liability for the restaurant owner or
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
the lensey regardless of the of the type
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
of license but for the lense so um and
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
and really the biggest concern I think
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
for us is whilst certainly U uh can
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that we have heard and seen
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
instances where yes restaurants are
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
finding nips in the trash cans Etc um
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
again that's against the best efforts of
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
what the business owners are trying to
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
prevent but where we get quite concerned
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
is the underage consumption in bathrooms
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
you know when we when we're monitoring
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
our service area you know restaurant
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
floor Hotel restaurant whatever it might
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
be you know we have staff that is coming
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
and going at all times that's not
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
happening necessarily in a bathroom
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
unless we post somebody in a bathroom
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
and frankly uh this is where we could
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
see the intersection of uh of AG
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
individuals purchasing alcohol and
 
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
meeting up with their underage friends
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
in a stall and just passing the drinks
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
off kind of scenario and I think that's
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
where we have a great deal of concern um
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know certainly can appreciate the
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
the horrific story that you know
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
triggered this uh proposal but um you
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
know I think this is where um businesses
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
working with with customers you know
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully trying to find ways that we
 
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
can combat these kinds of issues I will
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
also say that in talking with
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement and uh I assume they're
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
going to testify but you know more and
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
more businesses have cameras in their uh
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
service areas now for the very reason of
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
liability right because what we're
 
00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:39.079 align:start position:0%
trying to mitigate is the liability so
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
if we know for a fact that an individual
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
is slipping drinks to an underage person
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
in the restaurant we can catch them at
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
it um you know if they're doing it
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
surreptitiously if it's in a bathroom
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
where there's no cameras there's no
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
proof there's no way to track it just
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
creates an issue for us um so I I think
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is we have a great deal
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
of concern with this we hope we don't
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
change this particular proposal um so
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to try to answer any
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions you may
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%

good morning for the record my name is
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
Danielle Elon I am uh the deputy chief
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
of uh New Hampshire Liquor enforcement
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
and Licensing nice to meet you you new
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
members you'll be seeing a lot of our
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
our group today um I just wanted to
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple things um so everybody
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
has a clear understanding of what the
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
current law is what the current
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
investigation process is and um what the
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
law would do so yes the law right now
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
prohibits drinks from being brought into
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
the restroom um to speak to the over
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
server and minor issue uh an over if an
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
over service occurs there is a very
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
detailed and thorough investigation that
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
is conducted um so if we do encounter an
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
intoxicated person on the premise we do
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
do a full investigation we pull receipts
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
we interview staff we pull surveillance
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
video if that's the case so there could
 
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
be a situation where someone does um add
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol to their beverage in the
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
restaurant or in the bathroom and the
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant is not held liable if they
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
did not serve and were properly
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
monitoring the premise however um there
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
is statute that does say if a person
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
under the age of 21 is caught in
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
possession of alcohol inside your
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
licensed establishments then you are
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
liable as the leny that's very clear
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
that's a very black and white law if
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
they possess or consume alcohol on your
 
00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:44.839 align:start position:0%
premise you're liable doesn't matter how
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
they they obtained it doesn't matter how
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
they got it um the state is is very
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
strict when it comes to to minors
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
possessing alcohol um in terms of lenses
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
business practices um as the state and
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement we're not in the
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
business of telling the leny how to run
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
their establishment um they we inform
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
them of the laws it is up to them to
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
determine how they would like to uh
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
staff their establishments or the
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
individual business practices that they
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
put in place so to answer some of those
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions questions the leny could still
 
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit drinks in the bathroom they
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
would still be authorized to do that
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
they can prohibit drinks anywhere in
 
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
their license establishments that they
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
don't want uh people to drink the law
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
requires us to have approved Pro areas
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
of service which are the areas that they
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
say am I able to serve drinks in this
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
room or in this function hall or in this
 
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
um you know smaller room but they are
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
also allowed to limit it and create any
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
business practices that they think will
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
benefit them in uh safely operating
 
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
their business and in compliance with
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
the laws so they still would be able to
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
restrict access to the bathroom to um
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
you know follow up with what Mike summer
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
said um Staffing they're unable to staff
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
it they're unable to monitor it they
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
would still be able to to prohibit that
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
to Great any questions from the
 
00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
to Great any questions from the
committee

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
members yes represent wsh thank you Mr
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
chairman do you feel that there could
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
possibly be you know Under reporting
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
possibly a lot of Under
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
reporting um of the situation that
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative suan U mentioned because
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
just because of the you know
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
embarrassment and having to go through
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
the legal system so that you know
 
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps we don't know how large a
 
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
problem that this could possibly be and
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
that this could definitely help to avoid
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
it sure I think it it's hard to say one
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
way or the other what I would say is
 
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
that those complaints wouldn't
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily come to our organization um
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
they could come to us if there was if it
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
was suspected that um you know a
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
bartender or staff member was the one um
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
spiking the drinks but those complaints
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
tend to go more towards the local police
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
department so it's hard for us to say
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
that one way or another because it
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be um a complaint
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
directly any other
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%

ventilation system being so noisy here
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
so I will take this opportunity to uh
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
officially announce because not everyone
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
is knows that that we uh will be
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
abandoning this
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
building come to the we are we're going
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
to go up into the woods
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
up it's going to be a Scenic Drive to
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
get to where we're going uh but
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh would so uh but we'll be here in
 
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
conquer and um and but that will that
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
will I I assume it's supposed to happen
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
this this spring so I assume it'll
 
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
probably when we start in September
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
doing our our subcommittee or whatever
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
retain bills we will be meeting don't
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
know where we're going they do oh yeah
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's called what's the building
 
00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
called anybody anybody help me out here
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
what's the building conquered that we're
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
all going to it used to be the insurance
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
company's building the prison it's very
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
close to the prison you drive by it they
 
00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:06.109 align:start position:0%
close to the prison you drive by it they
get

00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
there who's from conquered here somebody
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
question the Department of Justice there
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
but after they got vacated this building
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
they moved up there but what what was
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
was that conquered insurance or what was
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
the insurance company that used to be in
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
that I see someone from the banking
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
Department right
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
Lincoln Lincoln yes that's what it was
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
Lincoln so so anyway uh they going knock
 
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
this building down no they're going to
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
rip this whole V they're going to re God
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
Ren the whole building the ventilation
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
system but evidently it's so dramatic in
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
terms of tearing and making a mess that
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
that they're going to we're going to uh
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
go on vacation another
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
Co trip okay all right 104 45 let's open
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
up the public hearing on uh House Bill
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
77 providing businesses from scanning
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
individuals licenses when selling
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol or tobacco products and I see
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
represent good morning
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative Mr
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning uh Mr chairman
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the the committee
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
for the record uh I am representative
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
Kevin verell from inham 2 I represent uh
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
Auburn Candia and Deerfield um this bill
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
is a direct result of um a constituent
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
request and so
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately my constituent has the
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
bad habit of um smoking uh smoking
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
so and other people have reached out as
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
well so when they go to purchase
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
cigarettes at C certain
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
establishments The Establishment is not
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
just checking the
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
identification for age
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
verification but they are scanning that
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
that identification typically a driver's
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
license and that gives uh many of my
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
constituents pause for privacy
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
concerns so we
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
can we can imagine
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
sort of a negative
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
scenario where we have somebody working
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
at an
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
establishment convenience
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
store and a customer comes in that
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps they're interested in perhaps
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
they they dislike and so they check the
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
identification and they scan it into the
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
database and now later of course that is
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
searchable so now you have the full name
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
you have the home address the driver's
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
license number you have a lot of
 
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.789 align:start position:0%
license number you have a lot of
personal

00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
information being
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
stored and for the life of me and and
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody can inform me for the
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
life of me I I can't
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
imagine why a business selling tobacco
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
products or alcohol would need to scan
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
and save personal
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
if we dismiss that as a concern which
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know I suppose you
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
could we can imagine people's personal
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
information being stored on a computer
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
that's attached to the internet and the
 
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
store gets hacked and now all that
 
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.589 align:start position:0%
store gets hacked and now all that
personal

00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
information is is stolen and and now you
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
know available to whoever whoever did
 
00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.270 align:start position:0%
know available to whoever whoever did
the

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
hacking this bill is actually paired
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
down from uh what I initially wanted to
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
file I wanted to file a ban on scanning
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
identification of somebody purchasing
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
any any good or service that they have a
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
legal right uh to to to purchase right
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
you check the ID maybe you write down
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
the driver's license number right that's
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
what we do in some in some cases if you
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
go to purchase a firearm they don't scan
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
your driver's license they they notice
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's a New Hampshire driver's license
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
and they put the the driver license
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
number and and they have that that
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
information in a a secured state and
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
federal database this is this is
 
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
different so this is a this is a good
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
faith effort to protect the privacy of
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
the citizenry at large it's not just New
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens you can imagine uh
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
maybe people coming from other states to
 
00:51:47.069 --> 00:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
buy alcohol and tobacco in New Hampshire
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
for various reasons and so to protect
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
their personal information this is a
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
good faith um effort at achieving that
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:56.670 align:start position:0%
good faith um effort at achieving that
goal

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
okay so I got one very simple
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
question who told you that they these
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
machine these Scanning Machines retain
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
any information that's on the card
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
because what I was told is that all it
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
does is looks at the barcode and helps
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
the merchant to say yes or no that
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're old enough but there is no
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
retaining of any personal information
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
not even retaining that that trans that
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
event even
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
occurred so I've been told that the
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
scanning of the of the identification is
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
is keeping that whatever scanner the the
 
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
store this person is using and others
 
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
they they believe that that information
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
is being scanned so I guess I would look
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
at the flip side we're getting we're
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
getting two different pieces of
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
information fair enough but if if I just
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
can flesh out my answer please yeah
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
chairman if you're correct and I'm
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
incorrect this bill does no harm and
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's still a good common sense prot
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
ction to put into place
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
proactively well I disagree with that
 
00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:03.799 align:start position:0%
because this bill says scan that the
 
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of these scans is so that
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
the the person who's checking for the ID
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do the math to find out
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
whether that person really is 18 or 21
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know over the years and might be
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
close close to their birth they show up
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
on their birthday you know that that
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
that they want to make sure they get it
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
right the purpose of the scan is so that
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's Quicky you just to get in it says
 
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
yes or
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
no and you're gone so that you're the
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill is the word right
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
out of the beginning the word scan you
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
need to remove scan you're you're saying
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
well we're saying you should be allowed
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
to do a scan for the sole
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of saying whether the person is
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
of age but not worrying and then and
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
that and then go on to say that it's a
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
Prohibition to uh record retain or store
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
not we could leave that language in but
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
you got to take out the part that allows
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
them to do the scan in the first place
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe Mr Mr chairman once
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
again I've gotten excellent advice from
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
you I've I don't think I've ever gotten
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
bad advice from you I would certainly be
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
more than willing to uh either have an
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted uh or or work with a
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
member of the committee for a friendly
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment um that might take Troublesome
 
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
language out but still accomplish the
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
the end goal and I I appreciate the
 
00:54:29.069 --> 00:54:29.079 align:start position:0%
advice so yes I I I I would not have a
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
problem with that it's the storage of
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
the information I have a problem with
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you now does anybody have
 
00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.910 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you now does anybody have
a

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
question we you can put in a pin card if
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
you want to speak I did yeah yeah but
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
you can't ask a question you can put in
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
a pin card
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
I okay all right so now we do have a
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
question we'll start at this end
 
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.030 align:start position:0%
question we'll start at this end
representative

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
burough thanks for qu answering my
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
asking thanks for answering my question
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative um is there is there ever
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
a legitimate reason for a business to
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
retain that information that you're
 
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.789 align:start position:0%
retain that information that you're
aware

00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
of so thank you for the question and
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to say thank you for
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
taking the question because I can refuse
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
to answer but I thank you for taking the
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate it very very much
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
certainly and thank you for being yeah
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly I I I can I can imagine
 
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
that there are commercial transactions
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
um or perhaps even private
 
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
transactions where the storage of that
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
type of information may be required I am
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
not an expert in in banking uh but I can
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
I can imagine that perhaps there are
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
Financial Vehicles where the institution
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
um that is you know carrying out those
 
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
transactions uh may be required to to
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
keep that information on on file we we
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
should note that my understanding of of
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
this section of law is that a consumer
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
can consent to having that information
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh copied not scanned copied and and
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
stored so that the consumer has the
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
right to say yes or no and choose to
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
move forward or or not the the the
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
institution um doesn't and shouldn't
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
have the right to demand it unless it's
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
legally required ired somewhere else in
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
in either RSA or federal code thank you
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
question represent Walsh thank you Mr
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just wondering what was
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
the background to specify pawn broker
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
scrap metal dealer or secondhand dealer
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
in this language yes thank you thank you
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
for the thank you for the question this
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
is um existing law and so the changes
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
are the parts that are crossed out which
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
would be language removed and the
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
language in bold is the language that
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
would be added um I'm I'm not sure what
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
font this is it looks like Times New
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
Roman so anything that's in a standard
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
Times New Roman font so not italicized
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
not bold not crossed out is is already
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
existing RSA and I I would defer to the
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
chairman to confirm that that that's
 
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.510 align:start position:0%
chairman to confirm that that that's
correct

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct thank you Mr chairman
 
00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:31.829 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct thank you Mr chairman
representative

00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:34.349 --> 00:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
civan thank you for taking my question
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
so I actually can get on board with your
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
intentions here I could definitely see a
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
world world where people unwillingly are
 
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
giving out their information and then
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's being sold and marketed and
 
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
whatever without you knowing um but I do
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
I do see something I haven't seen
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
addressed yet I'm wondering if you maybe
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
know or if anybody's talked to you about
 
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
it in your in your research before you
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
made this bill
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
are these machines designed to maybe
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
catch fake IDs because I could imagine a
 
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
world where you put my my ID in and we
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
know that I'm of age and so it's fine
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
but if you put in one and I was 20 it's
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
going to come up as fake but it might
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
not be something that I could tell as as
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
the as the shop owner and it's a good
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
way to kind of prevent them from being
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
liable for selling to somebody that
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
looks like they have a real ID when it's
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
really fake and that to me seems like if
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
you don't change it to prevent scanning
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
or something like that then that seems
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
like a potential risk that could now be
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
borne by the the convenience store or
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah thank you for the question
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
um so so I I I agree uh with the request
 
00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:39.079 align:start position:0%
of the the the chair that the word um
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
scan be be removed because it's it's not
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
the scanning that's the problem it's the
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's the storage of the information so I
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
have I have no problem with that I I'm
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the machines I've
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
never I've never seen one I've never
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
operated one uh they certainly don't
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
scan I don't buy tobacco products um but
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
I I do buy alcohol from time to time um
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
and my my identification has never been
 
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
never been scanned um for proof of of
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
age or any other purpose um because
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
there is such a wide
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
um breadth and depth of potential
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
identifications um I I I'm not sure that
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
the machine is universal I I would
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that if I showed up at my
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
my local convenient store to buy um say
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
a bottle of wine and I was challenged at
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
the checkout counter for my age and the
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
only identification I happen to be in
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
possession of was say uh either my
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
passport or a p they now have passport
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
cards right for for land Crossings only
 
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
I I would certainly hope that the
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
retailer would accept that and I I don't
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
know that these these scanners scan all
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
50 states I can imagine a tourist coming
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
down from Canada uh or or some other uh
 
00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
destination Europe Africa Asia Australia
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
I hate to leave anybody anybody out um
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
and their IDs would not match that so
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's simply a a a visual look but to to
 
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
remove scan um to Simply um stop the the
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
the saving of that information I have no
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
problem with so I think we have
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
alignment yeah um my understanding is
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a real ID issue it's a real
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that um if you ever want to experien
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
this I've been told that you can go into
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
one of those Massachusetts marijuana
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
stores and they all are required to have
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
them so Mr chairman is my
 
01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:39.039 align:start position:0%
understanding that the quote so now
 
01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
because there's we have to be careful
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
about language when we talk about real
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
ID right somebody like me thinks a
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license from from the state is
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
sufficient however the federal
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
government has imposed uh a pending
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
regulation of what they call real ID
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
which essentially Mak a state issued
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license a soft passport
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
although it can't be used for those
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
purposes right it becomes a federal ID
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
at that point uh to the best of my
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge Massachusetts or any other
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
state um that I'm aware of that that has
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
retail sales of cannabis requires a real
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
ID uh a standard New Hampshire driver's
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
license is sufficient uh New Hampshire
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
RSA does not mandate that New Hampshire
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
citizens obtain a real ID when they
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
renew their driver's license
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
and uh the the the the threat of course
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
is well you can't board a plane unless
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
you have a real ID well I'm blessed
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
enough to have a passport passport card
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
as well as global entry and any of those
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh identifications because they're
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
Federal are in fact default uh real IDs
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
so when when we when we're talking about
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
real ID in the quote as a federal
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
requirement um I'm not a I'm not aware
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
of States requiring real ID for cannabis
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
transactions and uh I don't believe that
 
01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
that can be mandated in New Hampshire
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
without Act of the
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislature that's true too thank you
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time uh question is this
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the chair or of me no I I guess it's
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
for the representative is he willing to
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
take another question oh certainly uh it
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
just occurred to me that when I go to a
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
grocery store all my groceries are
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
scanned and we going to see a bill in
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
the future and maybe this is not because
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's starting to sound
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
like we're snowballing into something
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
are we going to start seeing something
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
that a law that says that we can't scan
 
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.309 align:start position:0%
that a law that says that we can't scan
our

01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
groceries thank you for the question so
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
again I I've already yielded to the
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
question uh as as brought up by the
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
chair uh the removal of the word scan
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
causes me no pause at all I have no
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
problem removing the word scan for the
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of identification when
 
01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:56.119 align:start position:0%
you go to the grocery store they are are
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
choosing to scan items to determine the
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
price you your privacy is protected in
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
that if you pay
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
cash and you don't have are not
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
participating in their Rewards program
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
right because their Rewards program
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
obviously has your personal
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
identification if you pay cash then
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
there's no way to trace back a grocery
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
sale uh to the person person that made
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
purchase great so so to answer the
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
question no I don't believe that this is
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
a first step at snowballing to try to
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate scanning from
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
society thank you very much thank you Mr
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
chairman uh the chair we all call David
 
01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
Walker representative
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
Walker and uh Miss Johnson you will be
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
next but under protocol we always do
 
01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:48.870 align:start position:0%
next but under protocol we always do
reps

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
first good morning thank you Mr chairman
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is representative
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
Dave Walker from Rochester
 
01:03:59.549 --> 01:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
and I do kind of have uh problem with
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
the word
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
scan uh I have my problem with this the
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
way they do things is a different angle
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
I recently my uh driver's license
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
expired and as of December I needed to
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
get one of these which is a temporary
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
one while I'm waiting for the mail to
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
come well if I go to a
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
store and I want to buy an alcoholic
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
beverage or a cigar or cigarettes or
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to scan it's
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory to scan it well this doesn't
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
have a barcode cuz it's a temporary so
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
if you hand them a passport that doesn't
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
scan either so you're turned away and
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
you cannot buy alcohol or tobacco unless
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
you scan it so unless they go back to
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
due diligence where I last I knew I
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
don't look under 21 and they did the old
 
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
man with a white beard down to here did
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
but that we were
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
both denied and left so I think there
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be something changed in that
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
law that's you don't have to scan if you
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a barcode on your temporary
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
driver's license or your or your barcode
 
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
or your passport so that's where I
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
really have a problem is that you have
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
to scan or they don't serve you they
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't yeah but but that's that
 
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.630 align:start position:0%
don't yeah but but that's that
establishment's

01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
establishment's
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
policy that they only do scan other
 
01:05:27.789 --> 01:05:27.799 align:start position:0%
words we don't we don't statutorily
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
require that that that if they have a
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
policy that says his me I I always used
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
to laugh when I went you know in the
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
Boston Garden you know that you know
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
they would card me and I said well I
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
know my hair is platinum but it's not
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
the Platinum you might be thinking but
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
so I I assume that uh if you're that
 
01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
vendor that whoever you went to to buy
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
liquor or cigarettes and a would known
 
01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
you from the past cuz you you're regular
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
or maybe not actually and and and said
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
is no I cannot sell it to you because
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
it's their store policy that they have
 
01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
it's their store policy that they have
to

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
scan the legislature can't fix that
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
problem well because the word scan is in
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
the law that's their interpretation of
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
it and it's multiple places well right
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
now the we don't have any no the scan's
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
not in them in the law at
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
all that's what they're doing and right
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
that's their policy they the law and
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
then even though I am a regular customer
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
at this establishment they know I'm 61
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
years old I'm pretty sure they didn't
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
card you but if they did they did card
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
me okay and they and they wouldn't they
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
refused to sell to you correct because
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's no barcode on a temporary
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license and didn't you look at
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
the person in the eye and say yeah and
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
they look back at means said it's our
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
store policy they're going to get fired
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
if they didn't I would write a letter to
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
the editor of your local Rochester paper
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
and let everybody know that that
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
establishment is
 
01:07:04.269 --> 01:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
fickle I was actually thinking of
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
picketing the thing but that's
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
fine but it's more than one store it's
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
not just this one there was others in
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
Rochester that did the same
 
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
thing fair enough we have any other
 
01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
questions for the committee members
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you very much thank
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
you chair will now call in Deborah
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
Johnson from Grandam who is in support
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill and I hope you're not going
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
to really take 15 minutes we'll see I I
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
brought information I gave it to you um
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chair and to the people
 
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
for listening to me I would ask you uh
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
first of all since you asking you're
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
you're you're unclear as to what is
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
saved in here to turn to this third Leaf
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
of the the uh packet I gave you yeah
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
turn to the third
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
Leaf before I actually say what I have
 
01:07:52.319 --> 01:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
Leaf before I actually say what I have
to

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
say and about what what what these
 
01:07:57.559 --> 01:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
say and about what what what these
systems

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
do just uh why don't you since we don't
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
have enough for everybody would you
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
please read to me what you think is
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
important that they know this is one of
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
the the systems that's online that you
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
can find um it's called bizcard reader
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
scan ID scan ID is a powerful card
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
scanning software which helps you scan
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
manage and maintain driver licenses and
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
other identification cards it's scans
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
and stores driver driver licenses
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
medical and insurance cards and other
 
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
photo IDs and creates a searchable
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
database of the scan cards it reads the
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
pdf417 barcodes on us and Canadian
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and automatically
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
places the information from the barcode
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
into the respective name birth date
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
address and other fields it also has a
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
built-in OCR engine which allows you to
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
drag and drop data directly on from the
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
scanned IM image to any text field I
 
01:08:57.789 --> 01:08:57.799 align:start position:0%
can't read the the uh you could pass it
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
around there's pictures of what it what
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
it brings in I want you to note that it
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
also brings in the the driver's Li the
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
whole picture of the driver's license
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
with signatures there every there the
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
information on on the driver's license
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
everything your height your weight your
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%

license number your address it's all on
 
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
there including your signature tell me
 
01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:20.910 align:start position:0%
there including your signature tell me
that's

01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
not uh I I I I've studied this for for
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
quite a while but I now I will read you
 
01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:28.829 align:start position:0%
quite a while but I now I will read you
my

01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
statement house Commerce and consumer
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
affairs and this is also in your packet
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for addressing this issue that
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
threatens The public's ability to prot
 
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
protect against identity theft and other
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
dangers associated with private
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
identifying information since delving
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
into this issues I issue I have come
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
across other threats to individual
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
rights to keep themselves safe from
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
identity theft in this packet there's a
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
screenshot of the information collected
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
from driver's licenses and saved to
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
databases this is only one example of
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
the applications being marketed for this
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
purpose which begs the question of how
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
the federal law also included in this
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
packet is being
 
01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
ignored that was by the way that federal
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
law uh was done in 1993 Barbara Boxer um
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
was the uh sponsor of that bill and that
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill was created because a celebrity was
 
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
tracked down by her driver's license
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
information coming into the wrong hands
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
and she was killed and that's why that
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
bill was made but by by not doing this
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
we are ignoring the the federal
 
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.870 align:start position:0%
we are ignoring the the federal
law

01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
um while I first noticed and sounded of
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
the alarm regarding the scanning I
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
witnessed inconvenience stores when
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
standing behind customers during alcohol
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
and tobacco
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
purchases uh My article in Granite grock
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
brought comments from others that that
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
point out other venues where driver's
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
licenses are being scanned I was
 
01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
notified that Macy's department store
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
was scanning in order to prove identity
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
during credit card transaction
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
additionally some election polls are
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
using scanning rather than just viewing
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
IDs these are other examples that might
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
give consideration to broaden this the
 
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
title of this bill so is made clear that
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
all driver's license scanning is
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
prohibited except for those specified in
 
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
the law for decades I've been alarmed at
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
how casually our social security numbers
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
are used in various businesses for proof
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
of identity those of us over a certain
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
age might remember that these numbers
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
were originally strictly limited to
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
employment use only that was the promise
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
when created
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
today we see identity theft is running
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
rampid and this is one of the key pieces
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
last summer I chose to give up my
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
position as a lake host after four years
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
of service because I became aware that
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
without first notifying staff New
 
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes put employee information
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
in cloud-based Human Resources software
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
including full name address email birth
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
date and social security number it took
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
over took over a week for them to take
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
my information out of that system once I
 
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
object objected resigned and demanded
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
that they de delete my record from the
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
cloud during the back and forth I was
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
told that the that the system is very
 
01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
secure that same month the military
 
01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
employment data of the UK had been
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
hacked and I sent New Hampshire Lakes a
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
newspaper report covering that event I
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
have since learned that this style of
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
human resource management is becoming
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
widespread practice I urge you all to be
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
vigilant in protecting the public
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
against the danger of identity theft in
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
every possible area um I I have included
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
the federal law in this pack it's on the
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
on the starts on the back of the uh the
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
letter um I included uh links to other
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's a ton of these systems that are
 
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
being marketed online that collect our
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
data store them in a database and uh it
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
needs to stop and I I object to taking
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
the word scan out of out of this law um
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
it actually this law needs to be
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
broadened and and made so that our our
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
identity is protected and I hope that
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
our representatives are willing to do
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
that because this this world is getting
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
to be a scary place anybody have any
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
question the scanner that you're
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
referencing here is that the kind of
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
scanner we're talking about maybe the
 
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol commission can tell us if it's
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
the same one I I I I will tell you that
 
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
I did um write to and went through uh
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
weeks of going back and forth with the
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and I asked
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
them if they because they they told us
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
that um well they told if you if you
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
look at the New Hampshire law what it
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
what it originally said which is crossed
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
out on here is um unless authorized by
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and basically
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
if you go to the Department of Safety
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
and that's in this packet too um it has
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
their their rule
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
um it's it's on the on the back of the
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
second Leaf of this
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
um and and the and the department of
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
safety rule basically basically it says
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead scan I mean it says
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any rule of the contrary
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
the department authorizes the scanning
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
of personal information from any license
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
in electronic form or format so long as
 
01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
all of the following conditions are met
 
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
the equipment used to scan such personal
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
information does not visibly identify
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
any personal information other than
 
01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:20.679 align:start position:0%
driver's license number and name the
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
equipment used to scan the personal
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
information does not retain store or
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
transfer any personal information other
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
than driver's license number and name
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
for any period of time and the equipment
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
used to scan the personal information
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
does not store any personal information
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
other than the driver's license number
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
and name in a central repository
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
Disaster Recovery Central
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
repository such as cold site or hot site
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
whether on site or in a remote location
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
I asked the Attorney General um when I
 
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
complained about this to them
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
originally um and and they basically you
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
know said it's it's all okay I mean I've
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
got all of this here I asked well did
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
you go out and and check these scanners
 
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're not doing any
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
of this I got no answer I got blown
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
off where where I'm having a follow on
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
further question you may inquire iOS to
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
follow on
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
you uh where where I'm having a problem
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
with this is that
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
80% of all of our transactions happen
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
with credit cards so you have
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
no safety as far as your identity is
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
concerned so just I don't know what
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
color is now you can do cash you can
 
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
certainly do cash so my question is
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
there are scanners that don't store
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
fact we see them in the grocery store
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
time I think you have to be a little bit
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
more circumspect as to what type of
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
scanning you're talking about I like
 
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
know that where do I find that out where
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
do I find out what these are collecting
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
who's going to find out for us we need
 
01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.950 align:start position:0%
who's going to find out for us we need
that

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
when further question you may inquire
 
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
this is not really a question maybe this
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
is you for you to answer would you
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay when someone has a complaint about
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
anything they go to Consumer uh consumer
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
protection if you feel there's a problem
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
then you go to consumer prot I did that
 
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
I have all the back and forth right here
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
and they did nothing I I was I I guess
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
that's exactly
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
right okay so uh the good news is this
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
bill is going to go to a subcommittee
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
where we're going to drill down and
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
really get to the heart of the issue
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
here's what I can tell you at this
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
moment two three
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
26312 this RSA that's in is under the
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety relative to
 
01:16:55.719 --> 01:16:58.270 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety relative to
Driver's

01:16:58.270 --> 01:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
Driver's
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
Licenses so in terms of normally with
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
this committee we we probably had never
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
have never delved into this RSA in this
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
committee we would do consumer
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
protection and we would have our own
 
01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
statute that say with violation of the
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act for anybody to
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
store information that was gained
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
through scanning of a driver's license
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
we that's the way we would probably
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
write it simple as that how however
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
whether that's the right answer or not
 
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
whether what we're dealing with in terms
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
of figuring out what's going on with
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
this license statute we will resolve
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
that in the uh subcommittee the last
 
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
thing I want to say to you is is that it
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
is very interesting that you said there
 
01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
is actually a federal
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
law and that who enforces the federal
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
law not the state well the state can be
 
01:17:58.110 --> 01:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
find for the federal law I'm just saying
 
01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.550 align:start position:0%
find for the federal law I'm just saying
that

01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
obviously obviously the federal attorney
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
general's office has that right to find
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
States for selling marijuana but they
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
don't do that either okay so they have
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
chosen not to enforce that statute
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
that's not our problem our issue is how
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
do we deal with our
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
licenses whe whether real ID or not how
 
01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
we deal with our licenses in our state
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
and what information someone attempts to
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
acquire from a credit card or excuse me
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
from a driver's license the policy has
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
always been and uh that I've seen and I
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm tracking my mind but I know
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
I've seen before how um it is uh other
 
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of illegal that that you're not
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh and I remember was uh it was car
 
01:18:51.629 --> 01:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
dealers when they loan cars out to
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
people that they take a copy of your
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
when they loan your car to you that they
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
are allowed to do that but they must
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
destroy that license when you return the
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
car like that copy I think that's where
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm reaching back to so um we will
 
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
try to delve into this and get the right
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
answer here but as you well will begin
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
to see um there are a fair amount of
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
Industries and businesses in the state
 
01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
who would are very concerned with the
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
language of this bill as it's currently
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned with the I'm concerned
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
with the fact that these are being
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
scanned I have an addition I'd like to
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
make to the bill that any business
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's using a scanner must have go
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
through some some
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
process uh through the attorney general
 
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
or whoever would do it to make sure that
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
that scanner is not storing that
 
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:49.719 align:start position:0%
information I think that would be
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
weights and measures like we do with our
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
gas stations so I thought I would like
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
to if if if you're going to allow any
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
kind of scanner to be used then they
 
01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.390 align:start position:0%
kind of scanner to be used then they
should

01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
be they they there there should be a
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that those scanners
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
are only checking for uh the birth date
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
but fair enough you have to you have to
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
protect our safety we we're under attack
 
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
all the time with our our our private
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
information I agree does anybody else
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
have any more questions for me I have a
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
lot of information here but so we see
 
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
you when we do the subcommittee next
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
week you're doing a subcommittee next
 
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
week and you want me to come to that yes
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
we'd love to have you there and what is
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
the time I haven't scheduled it yet but
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
it'll be it'll be it'll be either
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
Wednesday it'll probably be Wednesday
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
stay tuned so I'll try to keep Thursday
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
free but it'll be Wednesday thank you
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
very much thank you okay gief
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
armag in our new protocol the next up
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
would be a state
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
enforcer who theoretically would be the
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
enforce but you're obviously it's
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety which you used to
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
do that so you probably know about this
 
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
statute 28 years of that
 
01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
right uh we're going to tag team this so
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh Danielle will come up here shortly uh
 
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
again for the record uh my name is uh
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
Chief Mark armaganian director of liquor
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement licensing with me here today
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
is uh as you have already met uh deputy
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
chief Danielle ston deputy director of
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
the same entity um we're going to tag
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
team this because there there are a lot
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
of moving Parts first and foremost from
 
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
from head of division um we appreciate
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
first of all I appreciate totally the
 
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
words of Representative testifying here
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
today uh privacy is I think first and
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
foremost in most of our heads um in the
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
retaining of information um really
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
concerns people like uh uh like was just
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
testified to um we are not seeing that
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
in our in our purview um and what we are
 
01:22:11.229 --> 01:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
seeing more not only from a law
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement point of view so I we wear a
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
couple of hats here and not only can I
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
speak from my vision eight years ago
 
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
from 28 years with Department of Safety
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
State Police but also from a law
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement point of view and a
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory point of view because as all
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
of you know and we've testified a ton of
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
times we're trying to keep the
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable age group safe at the same
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
time we're trying to protect our lenses
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
from fictitious the use of fictitious
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
IDs um and um to be quite honest about
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
and Danielle we'll talk more about it
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
those in the vulnerable age group that
 
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
might have
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
nefarious ideas of purchasing alcohol of
 
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
not of legal age we need some sort of
 
01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.950 align:start position:0%
not of legal age we need some sort of
verification

01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
verification
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
process um uh so with that in mind um I
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
I appreciate and I love the process that
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
goes on here of talking out bills um
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
scan the lack of scanning really hurts
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
this uh initiative um of verifying age
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
not retaining information
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
is Paramount we understand that so in
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
listening to the previous testimony that
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
was given uh from from the
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative to to the committee here
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
um it puts a smile on our face as we see
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
this morph into something that is usable
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
to not only law enforcement uh scanning
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
licenses because in the world of
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and Effectiveness if you go
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
into any Cruiser in this state barring
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
just a small group because of you know
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
monetary reasons um you will find that
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
information going into accident reports
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
running licenses verification of
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
identities that's all done by scanning
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
that is technology as we look at it
 
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
today like representative spear said I
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
scanning groceries all the way through
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
scanning Drive scanning is uh a way of
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
life now that that we deal with for
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
efficiencies so um we we understand what
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
is being said what is being brought
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
forward um and we like the position of
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
the committee and and uh especially you
 
01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:39.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh that we could take this
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
product and make it better uh in
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so Danielle will give some
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
technical information uh as it relates
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
questions good morning again um
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
I do think it's important um
 
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
specifically with the law proposes it's
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the scanning for the
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
verification of age for the purchase of
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
Alcohol Tobacco product um this is a
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
tool we see um used throughout the
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
industry for lenses to further assist
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
them with verifying age um as I stated
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
before in my previous testimony when you
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
get the liquor license and you or
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco license you as the licy incumber
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
the liability to ensure that the people
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
purchasing the product are of age so I
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
do think we need to give them every
 
01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
option and every tool available for them
 
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
to use to do that because even as a lie
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
you also are then expecting your clerk
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
to verify that age so that you yourself
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
as the L holder don't get in trouble so
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
we do see this used uh significantly
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the industry as a tool to
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
verify age what we have seen um in most
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
of our license establishments is what
 
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
the chairman talked about previously is
 
01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
Red Light Green Light the ID is scanned
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's basically scanned into a calculator
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
that says yes this person is 21 or not
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
21 um we have seen some development of
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
these uh point of sale systems which
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
help to identify fake IDs um I can tell
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
you that fictitious IDs and the quality
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
of these fake IDs has significantly
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
improved in the last 5 to 10 years um we
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
do training constantly on these they are
 
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
very hard to um identify that they are
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
fake we see these tools used um
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
primarily in college towns as well where
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know the fake IDs are coming in in
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
in uh in cases in the mail um so I do
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
think it is important to keep this as a
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
tool for the lenes one thing I do want
 
01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
to point out is that um again like I
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
said before we're not in the business of
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
telling the leny how to run their
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
business they have to ensure that
 
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
everybody that is purchasing alcohol and
 
01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco is of age how they do that is up
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
to them we have LIC CES that require IDs
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
by every Patron that comes in and
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
purchases Alcohol Tobacco doesn't matter
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
if you're 21 doesn't matter if you're 91
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
you have to that is their store policy
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
you have to present an ID we have uh
 
01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
licensed establishments who with a
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
temporary ID require another form of
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
backup with that temporary ID they are
 
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
able to put any restriction on that
 
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
policy that they feel helps them run
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
their business in compliance and and in
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
safety so um I do think there's a you'll
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
see a broad spectrum of policies when it
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
comes to is a passport C passport
 
01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
accepted is a passport card accepted by
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
Statute you can accept that as an age
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
verification tool but the lcy does not
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
have to accept them if they choose not
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
to if they choose to say we're not
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
accepting passports here for the
 
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
purchase of alcohol and tobacco they
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do that so in terms
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
of what you're going to see um in the
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
policy of iding we've we've seen all of
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
it uh yes sometimes it's scanned there's
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
even Point of Sales Systems out there
 
01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:55.719 align:start position:0%
that actually don't allow the sale to go
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
through unless there's there's a
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
scanning that's the point of sale system
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
they've decided to purchase that's the
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
policy that they've put in place so I
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
think you're going to see a variety of
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures with this but I
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
do think it is an important tool for the
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
industry to have um but we again we
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
agree the information should not be
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
stored it should simply be for Edge
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
verification um for that purchase to to
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
happen and if I can just uh further
 
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
furthermore I have had uh direct
 
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
conversations uh and I apologize I was
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
looking at my phone with director John
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
morasco of the Division of Motor Vehicle
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
um he him and I have been talking uh
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
consistently within the last two weeks
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
on this very issue of scanning um he has
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
proposed anva uh the association of uh
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh motor vehicle um uh motor vehicle
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
administrators thank you thank you Tom
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
um and and it is a red light green light
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
um uh initiative um I don't know how it
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
works I'm going to be seeing a test of
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
it uh to see exactly what that uh
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
entails at the same time it might be
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
something for him to give a uh maybe a
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
tutorial on that in front of the
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee here so you can all see it
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
again um
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
there is no retention of any information
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
it is age
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
verification uh as Daniel has said we
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
have seen errors even on the vertical
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
licenses that actually spell out in a
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
banner when the person turns 21 the math
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
the human error involved in doing the
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
math or just reading comprehension
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
because they're sometimes people get
 
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
nervous asking those
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions um a little bit of a lack of a
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
better term a little bit of a flat spin
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
happens and they discount what the
 
01:30:07.229 --> 01:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
license is actually saying to them and
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
and that sale is made to an underage
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
person when it says they're 19 years old
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
it let alone the license turned sideways
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
and it's sideways it's it's that of an
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
underage person um and like I said the
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
math has been done for you on the
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
license on the face of the license it
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
tells you when the person is going to
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
turn 21 so so this is a tool as Danielle
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
said to help the
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
licensees and I'm sure you'll hear from
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
industry too that it would handicap them
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
quite quite uh
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
substantially but I'm sorry to add to
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
that but just give you a little bit more
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
information M has a question uh thank
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman and thanks for
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just curious on I
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
just recently got my license renewed and
 
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
I got a a real license which I had to
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
bring in additional documents but my
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
question is on the on a the Hampshire
 
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
license does the
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
barcode actually confirm my age and so
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
what what's actually in the
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
barcode that thank you for your question
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative I think that's a better
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
question I I can wing it um but I think
 
01:31:20.109 --> 01:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
it's a better question for the director
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle um in winging it what the
 
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
these systems that we're familiar with
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
are actually as Danielle said they're
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
they're they're a calculator so they're
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
extracting or looking at the date of
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
birth in the code are they is there a
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
chip in the card or is it just looking
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
at the bar code I think it's a QR code
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
on the back the new ones are QR codes
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
the old ones used to be magnetic codes
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay so they're just looking the QR code
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then doing the math yep question
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
follow I I would would think that to if
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
if that information was in the barcode
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
not only the age but the name or
 
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
whatever it would be very difficult for
 
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
somebody to make a phony license and so
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
um if if they don't do that I I would
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
think a scanner
 
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
should should know that information so
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
to speak just yeah thank you thank you
 
01:32:21.149 --> 01:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
again representative um as Danielle has
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
stated The Fakes over overseas are
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
really good they're really good yeah
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
anybody can make a QR code and and the
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
information on the front of those LIC
 
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:34.669 align:start position:0%
information on the front of those LIC
are

01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
embedded I'm sorry Mr yeah I was just
 
01:32:38.669 --> 01:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
saying if there was a chip in it it
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
would be a different story y but because
 
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
it's a a QR code I mean that's as common
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
as I turn on my evening news and there's
 
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
a QR code on the screen for where I
 
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
should send money to if I could if I
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
could clarify so um we have just to be
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
clear we have seen fake IDs that do scan
 
01:32:58.030 --> 01:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
so they they actually pass the scanning
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
tool the ly is not held responsible for
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
that if it's a high qual the statute
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
allows for that if it's a high quality
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
fake ID they do their due diligence to
 
01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
check those IDs if they sell to a
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
fraudulent ID they're not held liable um
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
it runs the game and again there's very
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
very high quality fake IDs so this is
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
why even if we're asked should I get a
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes the last should we
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
get one again it's a business decision
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
based on the licy it's a tool it's not
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
the end all it's not the fail safe you
 
01:33:27.149 --> 01:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
know um it's not something if it's a
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
very you know if if you if I present
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
your ID and it scans and you make the
 
01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
stale you didn't do your dual diligence
 
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
and still checking that ID just because
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
it scanned and said you made the sale
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm very clearly not you so um it's not
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
a a fail safe for the ly it's not an end
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
all saying if you have this you're not
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
liable for anything it's just a tool for
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
they have but yes there are fake IDs
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
there there the majority of fake IDs do
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
not skin but there are fake IDs out
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
there that we have encountered that do
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
scan in certain systems so it's it's ID
 
01:33:59.470 --> 01:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
based it's system based it's it's
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
technology not like my Global where I
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
they I don't even hint them anything
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
they just take my picture and they can
 
01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
tell whether who I am okay
 
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.430 align:start position:0%
tell whether who I am okay
representative

01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
salie thank you for taking my question
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh my question is I do understand
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
scanning is important it's efficiency
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
purpose accuracy and all we save money
 
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
also but any automation comes with some
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a respon responsibility of the
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
people who are implementing that system
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
so I would like to know two things
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
number one do you guys have audit in
 
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
place which you guys do quarterly or six
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
month to make sure that this policies
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
has been implemented and you do do you
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
have the record of that and how many
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
audits has been done by the owner of the
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
system in last three
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
years so we're not um responsible for
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
the systems uh we're not responsible for
 
01:34:57.790 --> 01:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
auditing the system this statute is a is
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
under safety it's not under the liquer
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it's safety me if somebody is
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
basically saying that they are going to
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
scan my private information they need to
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
have a system in place to protect my
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
information and only way the customer
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
will have some kind of a uh some kind of
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
a basically they are comfortable if
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
there is a audit in place and which has
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
to be followed and it has to to be
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines would you believe would you
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
believe yeah we need to be what you were
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
going to say would you believe would you
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
believe yes perfect thank you you're
 
01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
teaching me that's fine thank you very
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
much I I trying to emphasize for you
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
freshman we're not judging we we're just
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of our opinion we
 
01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
don't we don't want to know your opinion
 
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
in the hearing yeah that is correct okay
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
we don't know all we're trying to do is
 
01:35:55.629 --> 01:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
get information from the public and from
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
the Departments and people who are
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
affected by the legislation but then
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
once we get into the subcommittee an
 
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
exact session then you're free to yeah
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
go crazy on your opinion no I would
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
rather basically ask the question and
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
they let them be prepared for the next
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
session and yes if I if I can add into
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
this Mr chairman thank you uh again for
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
your question Mr representative um I
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
think also because this bill is pointed
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
at tobacco and alcohol we think liquor
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement but really the oversight is
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
safety and there are other departments
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
throughout state that actually have
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
oversight of POS systems and that so so
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's a great question um that has to be
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
pointed at the right people um in the
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
room so um but at at the end of the day
 
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh we try to do our due diligence we
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
understand what everybody's concerns are
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
and we're not snubbing them at all thank
 
01:37:00.669 --> 01:37:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking a question I just
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
want to understand the process so when
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
the scanning scanning is done does it uh
 
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
connect with the Department of Motor
 
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
Vehicles or somewhere to validate that
 
01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
so the amb system does do that from what
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
I've been told but I'm sorry it was a
 
01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
very brief conversation that I had with
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
the director of Motor Vehicle so that's
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
going to be a bigger conversation and
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
maybe he can come to the subcommittee to
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
testify in front of you um the systems
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about uh like our own
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
are localized systems that pretty much
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
do the math for you it's a calculator
 
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
within the POS system that just figures
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
out your age and that's it it doesn't
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
retain information at all now is that
 
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
everybody I don't know um there's been
 
01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
some compelling information that's been
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
given to us uh today that says that
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
there are systems out there that retain
 
01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
information um which is against state
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
law and those those issues have to be
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
brought up to the proper authorities um
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
but there are others that don't retain
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
information and just figure out Age and
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're here to just make
 
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
sure we can protect and again I really
 
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate what the representative and
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you have said with each
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
other um uh because it's in our eyes
 
01:38:35.229 --> 01:38:35.239 align:start position:0%
it's going in the right
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
direction thank you thank you great
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh I have three
 
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
cards in opposition and I see another
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
card hiding there whether she's going to
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
show up or not um I would say that um
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's a chair I have have been around for
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
a while so I I can I scan the room and
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
always keep in an eye on the room and I
 
01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:56.679 align:start position:0%
do know that there is the bank
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and represent the bank
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
Department because I believe I'm record
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
I'm require they're required to copy
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
that driver's license and keep it as
 
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
part of the file when I could do my
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
mortgage so that again would say to me
 
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
is that that the statute probably put it
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
in the consumer protection act bank is
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
exempt from it so it might cover all
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
businesses except those four Industries
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
but we have to decide how we want to
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
handle that but um there it in this case
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill is uh um it it's
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
probably in the wrong statute to for
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement okay having said that Tom
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
parasol representing the Hampshire
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
retail association in opposition to the
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill and please do not repeat anything
 
01:39:56.109 --> 01:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%

Hampshire retail association um I
 
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:08.679 align:start position:0%
understand you've heard a lot of
 
01:40:10.109 --> 01:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
information and that this bill will be
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to a subcommittee so I will keep
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
my testimony uh brief I do want to say
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
that uh the New Hampshire retail
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
association represents about 350 members
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh Statewide of all different sizes and
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
we also recognize that this bill is an
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
attempt to protect the privacy of of
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
individuals and I want to assure you
 
01:40:32.669 --> 01:40:32.679 align:start position:0%
that that is also a Cornerstone part of
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
what the retail establishments do um one
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
thing I do want to point you to uh and
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
this will all come out during
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which I more than happy to
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
participate in is there are currently
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
rules around the law that is exists and
 
01:40:51.190 --> 01:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:53.709 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:53.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
about obtaining the information um to
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
verify the identity of the consumer and
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
also about not using the information
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
whole or in part obtained from license
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
um to link with any other database um in
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
addition to that there are also safety
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
protections that were established in a
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
bill that was adopted I believe two
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
years ago Senate Bill 255 relative to
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
privacy which requires uh businesses to
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism for folks to purge
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
their information from any system so
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
that information uh is is already out
 
01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
there as well um I just want to go on
 
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
record saying that retail establishments
 
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
do take age verification very seriously
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
and this is as uh deputy chief Ellison
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned a tool they have in the toolbx
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they are complying with
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
the age restriction laws in the state
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
with that I will keep my testimony at
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
that answer possibly any questions I can
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to the subcommittee
 
01:41:55.149 --> 01:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
next week perfect thank you very much
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
chair we'll call on Rich Parsons of the
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
Association good morning Rich Parsons um
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
R young pelli representing the New
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire groceries Association um we
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
are also opposed to this bill today for
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
similar reasons that have already been
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
said I thought I was going to give you
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
some new information about the Privacy
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
Bill SB 255 that Tom mentioned but he
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
beat me to it that law just went into
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
effect January 1st and allows the
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
consumer to to figure out what
 
01:42:34.109 --> 01:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
information any business is collecting
 
01:42:35.589 --> 01:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
on them in the state and be able to have
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
that information deleted um the the
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
attorney general just put out a document
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
on it actually yesterday so um my
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
testimony kind of speaks for itself on
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
the importance of being able to scan for
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
age restricted products to ensure we
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't have severe penalties um you know
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
the red light green light system was
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
already disc discuss but that is what
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
the system that is in place for the
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
folks that do scan U that we've heard
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
they do that kind of they scan it gives
 
01:43:02.669 --> 01:43:02.679 align:start position:0%
them a red light or a green light um and
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
we otherwise abide by all federal and
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
state the new state privacy laws as well
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll take any
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:19.639 align:start position:0%

100 years uh we have 70 retail locations

Community above everything else we hold
 
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
Three core values strong to our heart
 
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
one fueled by family it's not just our
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
individual families but the families
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
that come and visit our uh stores and
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
purchase from our stores you are our
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
family in general always doing the right

thing taking ownership of the things

that we do dayto
 
01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
day and doing it in a way that makes
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
sense both for the company as well as
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
for our customers and then safety in
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
everything that we do this is our
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
strongest value we hold and we believe
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
that if we have a safe working
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
environment for our employees and a safe
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
atmosphere for our customers we're
 
01:44:35.229 --> 01:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
making a change for our communities for
 
01:44:37.149 --> 01:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
halfers scanning IDs when selling
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol and tobacco isn't just about
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
following the law it's about protecting
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
our families doing the right thing for
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
our customers and ensuring a safer
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
future for our youth we use the ID
 
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
scanning technology which can
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
confidentially verify every customer's
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
age reducing the the risk of underage
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
sales and preventing harmful products
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
from getting into the wrong hands
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
without this technology the store Andor
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
the associate would be at an increased
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
risk of violations caused by human error
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's a small but crucial step that helps
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
us build trust with our customers while
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
upholding our responsibility to the
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
community and our core
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
values our system does not store any
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
personal information and by physically
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
scanning the ID it helps our Associates
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
accurately verify a customer's Aid age
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
reducing the risk of illegal sales to
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
miners for us it's not just about the
 
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
transaction it's it's a commitment to
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
family Integrity safety and the vales
 
01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
strong thank you very much any questions
 
01:45:43.709 --> 01:45:43.719 align:start position:0%
from the committee members I think
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
they're all question and doubt I feel so
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate it and we have
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
one card left Kate fry from new futures
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
bill good afternoon members of the
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate fry I'm the
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
vice president of advocacy at new
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
Futures we are an organization that
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
works on health and wellness policies um
 
01:46:16.589 --> 01:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
I uh specialize in the area of substance
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
misuse so I would just say I'm not I'm
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
just going to add additional um
 
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
information most of what
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
um my thoughts are have been said um but
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
we know that uh checking IDs is an
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
important measure both for preventing
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
alcohol and um tobacco misuse and
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
underage use the only thing that I was
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
hoping that the Liquor Commission would
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
bring up is that there could be some
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
federal laws uh Federal funding at stake
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
if our non-compliance rates dip for um
 
01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.270 align:start position:0%
if our non-compliance rates dip for um
tobacco

01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
regulations um states are required under
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
the Sinar law to meet a certain amount
 
01:46:58.589 --> 01:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
of um do a certain amount of inspections
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
and compliance checks if that non
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
compliance check Falls below 20% Then
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
Federal funding could be at risk um so
 
01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying this is an effective
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
tool first as uh was said earlier by The
 
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission if this is a tool that
 
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
businesses rely on to make sure they're
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
in compliance and also um protecting
 
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
their liability we feel that it's
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
important to have an option and I will
 
01:47:26.109 --> 01:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
just go on record saying that we just
 
01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
believe the rec it should be scanned we
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
would not want any business to keep
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much any questions
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
from the committee members seeing none
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who would like to
 
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
77 I get the right bill number they did
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll close the public
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:00.719 --> 01:48:03.229 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
what we have
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
two so if you look at this this is how
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
it is so when the time gets when the
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
time gets announced like even if we
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
finish early like like we finished this
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
one early we had to wait until we got to
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
that time you can't
 
01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
start because other people will yeah
 
01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:51.709 align:start position:0%
start because other people will yeah
you

01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.719 --> 01:49:21.709 align:start position:0%

03:19:27.990 --> 03:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay we open up the public Hearing in
 
03:19:30.229 --> 03:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 79 and hear from the prime
 
03:19:33.150 --> 03:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative leechman good
 
03:19:49.469 --> 03:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:52.189 --> 03:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon Mr chairman if you
 
03:19:54.670 --> 03:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
look like the representative Washington
 
03:19:58.950 --> 03:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:01.630 --> 03:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
there we have a failed heating system
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
here and it's aide to be on full full
 
03:20:08.670 --> 03:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
blast so it's really warm down here
 
03:20:11.429 --> 03:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
anyway for the record Mr chairman my
 
03:20:13.389 --> 03:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
name is Peter lean I represent the towns
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
of petero and Sharon and I'm here to
 
03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
address uh House Bill
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
79 as the chairman knows I've taken a
 
03:20:24.269 --> 03:20:24.279 align:start position:0%
particular interest in The Liquor
 
03:20:26.590 --> 03:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
Commission over the years and have filed
 
03:20:28.349 --> 03:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
certain pieces of
 
03:20:31.189 --> 03:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
legislation um this legislation as you
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
can see is just to establish a
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
commission to look at the Liquor
 
03:20:36.510 --> 03:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
Commission to see whether it should be
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
privatized or not it's not saying it
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
should or it shouldn't but I think it's
 
03:20:45.070 --> 03:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
time that we give a real good look um I
 
03:20:46.750 --> 03:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
have probably the disadvantage of of
 
03:20:49.229 --> 03:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
serving on the finance committee where
 
03:20:51.429 --> 03:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
my division looks at The Liquor
 
03:20:54.590 --> 03:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
Commission and for a a long period of
 
03:20:57.429 --> 03:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
time now there's been significant growth
 
03:20:59.750 --> 03:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
in expenses but not a corresponding
 
03:21:01.070 --> 03:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue I just looked at the revenue
 
03:21:06.790 --> 03:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
figures for um the last six months it's
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
kind of disappointing the revenues are
 
03:21:13.830 --> 03:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
down uh nearly uh well
 
03:21:17.229 --> 03:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
18.7% over plan that's a significant
 
03:21:19.229 --> 03:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
amount of money it makes it difficult
 
03:21:21.950 --> 03:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
for us uh to find the money to keep the
 
03:21:26.110 --> 03:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
state going and again uh we've seen a
 
03:21:28.429 --> 03:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
lot of increase in expense but not a
 
03:21:32.309 --> 03:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
corresponding increase in revenues so
 
03:21:34.510 --> 03:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
with that Mr chairman I would certainly
 
03:21:36.349 --> 03:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions I know there are
 
03:21:39.870 --> 03:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
people behind me that also wish to
 
03:21:42.269 --> 03:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
speak okay representative mcleer has a
 
03:21:44.790 --> 03:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman um thank you
 
03:21:47.469 --> 03:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question where is this
 
03:21:50.510 --> 03:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
expense coming from any any particular
 
03:21:53.309 --> 03:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
area is IT personnel is it uh location
 
03:21:56.469 --> 03:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
rents you know uh Personnel is a Big
 
03:22:00.189 --> 03:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
Driver um last the last budget cycle I
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
actually wrote that down to make sure I
 
03:22:03.870 --> 03:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
had the correct numbers The Liquor
 
03:22:06.229 --> 03:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
Commission had up 343 and they were
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
asking for an increase so bring the
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
number of employees up to
 
03:22:12.349 --> 03:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
371 uh there are expenses they're
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
building rather attractive um liquor
 
03:22:17.670 --> 03:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
stores around the state and there is an
 
03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
expense there they're not paid for right
 
03:22:21.070 --> 03:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
out of the gate they're paid for over a
 
03:22:23.469 --> 03:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
period of time so I think it's important
 
03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
to at least get a group of people
 
03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
together not only legislators but people
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
that are affected by the industry to see
 
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether it makes sense to private ties
 
03:22:36.550 --> 03:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
or not uh James Farah who I think you
 
03:22:39.630 --> 03:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
may know he's now U at the Legislative
 
03:22:42.229 --> 03:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
Office he's our key person over there
 
03:22:44.229 --> 03:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
the number one person I talked to James
 
03:22:46.630 --> 03:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
who used to work for the liquor commit
 
03:22:49.189 --> 03:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
Mission and he said that we'd probably
 
03:22:51.469 --> 03:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
realize over a billion dollars if that
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
was sold it's all again it would only be
 
03:22:57.150 --> 03:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
one time money but perhaps if we had an
 
03:22:59.630 --> 03:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh fee or tax structure we'd
 
03:23:02.349 --> 03:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
make just as much money without owning
 
03:23:05.070 --> 03:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission as we do now
 
03:23:07.110 --> 03:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for your
 
03:23:10.229 --> 03:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
question representative Gibbs thank you
 
03:23:13.189 --> 03:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um just a question about
 
03:23:15.229 --> 03:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
building of new liquor stores obviously
 
03:23:17.670 --> 03:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's a big expense but isn't
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
construction usually paid for Via
 
03:23:21.950 --> 03:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
bonding rather than out of the general
 
03:23:24.830 --> 03:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
budget it's paid for by money from The
 
03:23:28.030 --> 03:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission so any if they if they
 
03:23:29.630 --> 03:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
have a bond it's actually money that
 
03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
does come from The Liquor Commission
 
03:23:35.150 --> 03:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
fund it's not General funds if you will
 
03:23:37.750 --> 03:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
for another use aren't being paid to you
 
03:23:40.550 --> 03:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
know build liquor
 
03:23:44.429 --> 03:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
stores sure representative pusk uh thank
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I thank you for taking
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
my question representative uh if memory
 
03:23:53.189 --> 03:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
serves two years ago four years ago
 
03:23:56.790 --> 03:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
there were efforts to uh get rid of the
 
03:24:00.510 --> 03:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission uh how is this bill
 
03:24:03.309 --> 03:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
here significantly different than two
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
years ago's Bill except for the fact
 
03:24:09.150 --> 03:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
that this now uh creates a commission
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you now this looks at a commission
 
03:24:13.030 --> 03:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
to make a recommendation of the
 
03:24:14.750 --> 03:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
legislature whether it should be
 
03:24:17.550 --> 03:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
privatized or not so it's not forcing a
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
decision yet on the legislature the
 
03:24:22.590 --> 03:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
commission may come back with a uh
 
03:24:25.510 --> 03:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation that it works well now or
 
03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
it may come back and say it needs more
 
03:24:30.150 --> 03:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
study or maybe we should privatize it so
 
03:24:32.189 --> 03:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
it's opening it up for further review
 
03:24:34.030 --> 03:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
and getting people outside of the
 
03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:36.110 align:start position:0%
and getting people outside of the
legislature

03:24:36.110 --> 03:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:24:36.120 --> 03:24:39.950 align:start position:0%
legislature
involved

03:24:39.950 --> 03:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
post thank you Mr chair um so so with
 
03:24:51.429 --> 03:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
this is uh starting a commission is
 
03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
there an expense to that the only
 
03:24:56.349 --> 03:24:56.359 align:start position:0%
expense would be to pay legislators to
 
03:24:58.229 --> 03:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
commute it's within the bill so there
 
03:25:00.830 --> 03:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any money given to say
 
03:25:02.990 --> 03:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
someone that was appointed by their
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association or the U Attorney
 
03:25:07.710 --> 03:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
General's office which is mentioned in
 
03:25:09.790 --> 03:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
the bill so it's just mileage for
 
03:25:12.550 --> 03:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
legislators okay thank
 
03:25:14.910 --> 03:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:25:16.950 --> 03:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
burrow thank you Mr Mr chair and thank
 
03:25:18.349 --> 03:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
03:25:22.030 --> 03:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
question from what I've learned the the
 
03:25:24.670 --> 03:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
decline in sales of Revenue are across
 
03:25:27.150 --> 03:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
the across many states because the
 
03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
increase in consumption of cannabis and
 
03:25:30.870 --> 03:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you've looked at that and
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
have drawn any conclusions from that
 
03:25:37.269 --> 03:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
I've heard that I don't know um how much
 
03:25:39.870 --> 03:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
truth there is to that uh generally
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
liquor sales are down worldwide I
 
03:25:44.710 --> 03:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
believe uh people aren't drinking as
 
03:25:47.750 --> 03:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
much as they used to uh um it's dry
 
03:25:49.710 --> 03:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
January so probably the revenue figures
 
03:25:51.790 --> 03:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
for next month will be even worse than
 
03:25:54.750 --> 03:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
they are for the last six months but I'm
 
03:25:56.750 --> 03:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
sure cannabis is having an impact even
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
though it's allegedly illegal in New
 
03:25:59.439 --> 03:26:03.870 align:start position:0%
though it's allegedly illegal in New
Hampshire

03:26:03.870 --> 03:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
still and also the biggest competitor
 
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
Total Wines has doubled the amount of
 
03:26:11.189 --> 03:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
stores they have in Massachusetts so
 
03:26:13.870 --> 03:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
that would cut into who's usually one of
 
03:26:15.910 --> 03:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
our major customers is Massachusetts
 
03:26:15.920 --> 03:26:17.830 align:start position:0%
our major customers is Massachusetts
resident

03:26:17.830 --> 03:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
resident
 
03:26:23.630 --> 03:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
correct representative Ammon thank you
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for other testimony
 
03:26:31.150 --> 03:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
um we've heard some complaints that
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's too many
 
03:26:36.110 --> 03:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
commissions and uh there's a suggestion
 
03:26:39.469 --> 03:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
that I heard earlier today to cut two
 
03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
commissions for every one you
 
03:26:43.950 --> 03:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
create this wouldn't be a good one to do
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
that too well you this isn't cre yet
 
03:26:48.510 --> 03:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
this would be the one you create right
 
03:26:52.189 --> 03:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
so if if you have you would you give it
 
03:26:55.590 --> 03:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
any thought to trim down some other
 
03:26:57.630 --> 03:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
commissions do you have two commissions
 
03:26:59.790 --> 03:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
you want to get rid of yeah you know to
 
03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
be honest with you I I don't know
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
whether the commissions have been
 
03:27:04.429 --> 03:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
proposed yet I haven't seen any that
 
03:27:06.990 --> 03:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
have hit my radar but I hope this would
 
03:27:08.750 --> 03:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
be one that you'd consider because it's
 
03:27:11.030 --> 03:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
an issue that I think really should be
 
03:27:13.590 --> 03:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
addressed because of declining revenue
 
03:27:16.389 --> 03:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
and um whether we want to continue on a
 
03:27:18.590 --> 03:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
path with a part of state government
 
03:27:20.790 --> 03:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion probably should be
 
03:27:22.590 --> 03:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
handled in private hands versus the
 
03:27:25.070 --> 03:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
state running of the Liquor
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
Commission but that's up for the
 
03:27:28.950 --> 03:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
commission Mr chairman would the revenue
 
03:27:32.670 --> 03:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
to the state be radically reduced if it
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
was in private hands I don't believe so
 
03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
but we as you already know generate over
 
03:27:42.510 --> 03:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
$800 million here and we generally get
 
03:27:46.950 --> 03:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
around a $100 million back so to me
 
03:27:48.830 --> 03:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
it seems a little lopsided when you're
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
bringing in over $800 million and
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
declining revenues and generally we're
 
03:27:57.150 --> 03:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
in the 100 plus or minus range at the
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
end of the year I don't have my numbers
 
03:28:01.710 --> 03:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
in front of you but I think those
 
03:28:05.670 --> 03:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
numbers are wrong so representative
 
03:28:09.110 --> 03:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
spear I I know that uh that you look at
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
the numbers and you and you see all that
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
but just off the top of your
 
03:28:17.670 --> 03:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
head what would you hope hope to gain if
 
03:28:20.150 --> 03:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
we did privatize I mean what do you see
 
03:28:22.110 --> 03:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
as a possibility
 
03:28:25.630 --> 03:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
there from my own experience in the U
 
03:28:27.309 --> 03:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
business I'm in outside of the
 
03:28:29.429 --> 03:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
legislature I'm actually in the railroad
 
03:28:31.429 --> 03:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
business this is heavily regulated by
 
03:28:33.309 --> 03:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
the government and where the government
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
has stepped back uh within the industry
 
03:28:38.469 --> 03:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
there's been more profitability actually
 
03:28:38.479 --> 03:28:39.510 align:start position:0%
there's been more profitability actually
more

03:28:39.510 --> 03:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:28:42.990 --> 03:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
safety um I think generally business
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
runs Private Business runs better than
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
govern government has proven that um
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
most government agencies are more
 
03:28:52.990 --> 03:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
expensive to oversee and run than
 
03:28:56.830 --> 03:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
Private Industry so um my guess is that
 
03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
the expenses would be eliminated
 
03:29:00.630 --> 03:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
obviously if the Liquor Commission was
 
03:29:03.550 --> 03:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
privatized and all we would actually be
 
03:29:05.830 --> 03:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
looking to gain is taxes from Liquors
 
03:29:08.309 --> 03:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
and wine
 
03:29:11.389 --> 03:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
sales representative Sullivan thanks for
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just curious if
 
03:29:15.550 --> 03:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
you know and maybe it's for the liqu
 
03:29:16.910 --> 03:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
commission when they come up afterwards
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
but presumably we want some sort of
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission to stick around to you
 
03:29:22.469 --> 03:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
know make sure that they're following
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
regulations that we have in place do we
 
03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
know if those are broken up separately
 
03:29:30.189 --> 03:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
or those just all costs in which case
 
03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
those costs wouldn't be eliminated would
 
03:29:34.750 --> 03:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
we were we to um privatize yeah
 
03:29:36.349 --> 03:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement is they already have an
 
03:29:37.950 --> 03:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement division as I'm sure you
 
03:29:40.830 --> 03:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
know that's part of their expense MH uh
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the bill it asks for the
 
03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
someone from the Department of Safety to
 
03:29:47.030 --> 03:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
be involved um there's been a long
 
03:29:47.040 --> 03:29:48.150 align:start position:0%
be involved um there's been a long
debate

03:29:48.150 --> 03:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
debate
 
03:29:50.750 --> 03:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
between legislators the department of
 
03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
safety's been involved in some of this
 
03:29:55.229 --> 03:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
discussion whether this state state
 
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
police should oversee enforcement versus
 
03:30:00.469 --> 03:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
a separate enforcement agency within
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
liquor uh you still have to have
 
03:30:04.830 --> 03:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
somebody like an enforcement arm it
 
03:30:06.750 --> 03:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
probably would fall to the Department of
 
03:30:08.750 --> 03:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration that does
 
03:30:10.750 --> 03:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
cigarettes right now or some maybe a
 
03:30:13.150 --> 03:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
smaller agency within state government
 
03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
but you'd still need enforcement you'd
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
still need the taxing author
 
03:30:18.389 --> 03:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
to go out and make sure that the taxes
 
03:30:20.550 --> 03:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
were paid on Lor sales so some cost
 
03:30:22.389 --> 03:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
there would be some cost for sure thank
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
you but that's something again I think
 
03:30:26.750 --> 03:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
the commission would discuss and
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
determine what kind of costs there will
 
03:30:31.389 --> 03:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
be this is just again opening the the
 
03:30:33.229 --> 03:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
door to take a look at what we should be
 
03:30:34.510 --> 03:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
doing going
 
03:30:36.550 --> 03:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
forward representative
 
03:30:39.670 --> 03:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
Herbert uh thanks for recognizing me
 
03:30:42.630 --> 03:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming in sure my question
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
is if we were to privatize and there are
 
03:30:48.070 --> 03:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of privatizations of public assets
 
03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
going on right now not all of them
 
03:30:53.670 --> 03:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
successful but uh would the cost of a
 
03:30:56.750 --> 03:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
liquor go up you would be a great member
 
03:30:58.990 --> 03:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
to be on that Commission because that
 
03:31:00.349 --> 03:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
would be I think a question that the
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
commission may be able to address
 
03:31:04.189 --> 03:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure you'd hear from people
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
outside maybe people that are selling
 
03:31:08.790 --> 03:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
already in our neighboring state to tell
 
03:31:10.950 --> 03:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
us whether the cost would go up or down
 
03:31:12.910 --> 03:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
but that would certainly be a question
 
03:31:17.349 --> 03:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.359 --> 03:31:18.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:31:18.550 --> 03:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:31:20.910 --> 03:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
repres thank you chair thanks for taking
 
03:31:25.630 --> 03:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
my call um my question is we have uh
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
right now decent jobs through this
 
03:31:30.910 --> 03:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
activity done through the government do
 
03:31:34.510 --> 03:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
you think that by doing a privatizing
 
03:31:36.750 --> 03:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
are the this are we basically cutting
 
03:31:39.030 --> 03:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
down the good jobs and we are trying to
 
03:31:42.189 --> 03:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
get into privatization to make profit
 
03:31:45.429 --> 03:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
for very few people and trying to cut
 
03:31:47.469 --> 03:31:47.479 align:start position:0%
the cost and get the profit that is the
 
03:31:50.110 --> 03:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
objective of privatization or what is
 
03:31:51.670 --> 03:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
the objective of
 
03:31:54.990 --> 03:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
privatization well again I think uh all
 
03:31:57.349 --> 03:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
these stores would still require
 
03:31:59.110 --> 03:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
employees they would not be working for
 
03:32:00.510 --> 03:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
the State anymore and be a
 
03:32:01.950 --> 03:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state they'd be
 
03:32:04.750 --> 03:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
working for a private entity but that
 
03:32:06.269 --> 03:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
again maybe the commission would come
 
03:32:07.910 --> 03:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
back and say it just doesn't work and it
 
03:32:13.229 --> 03:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:16.870 --> 03:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
is representative pelli thank you for um
 
03:32:18.670 --> 03:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
letting me ask the question and thank
 
03:32:22.510 --> 03:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
you for the interesting bill so is it I
 
03:32:24.429 --> 03:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
guess I just want to understand the work
 
03:32:26.189 --> 03:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
product that's coming out of this
 
03:32:29.070 --> 03:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
commission so is it your intention from
 
03:32:31.910 --> 03:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
this commission to do a detailed cost
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis and you know really do
 
03:32:38.590 --> 03:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
a deep dive into the into the um profit
 
03:32:40.990 --> 03:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
and loss and make that recommendation
 
03:32:44.429 --> 03:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
and if it is do you have the right
 
03:32:46.750 --> 03:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
makeup on this Commission
 
03:32:48.670 --> 03:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
well that would be my hope but certainly
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
this committee could add or subtract
 
03:32:53.150 --> 03:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
they may feel that chairman hunt should
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
share the commission to look into this
 
03:32:57.469 --> 03:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
but that would certainly be my hope that
 
03:32:59.790 --> 03:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
they would do a deep dive I've served on
 
03:33:01.469 --> 03:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
a number of commissions in the past and
 
03:33:03.189 --> 03:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's been my experience that members of
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
a commission take their jobs very
 
03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
seriously and often do a very deep dive
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:12.990 --> 03:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
subject representative burrow and
 
03:33:14.910 --> 03:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you and thank
 
03:33:16.349 --> 03:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question question and
 
03:33:18.550 --> 03:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
it kind of um dovetails what the
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative um representative said
 
03:33:23.189 --> 03:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
previously I'm concerned about the 1400
 
03:33:24.349 --> 03:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
people who work for the Liquor
 
03:33:26.349 --> 03:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
Commission and as you said some of them
 
03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
may fold into a new a new uh private
 
03:33:32.309 --> 03:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
system um and I lost what I was going to
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
say but um would it perhaps be less
 
03:33:38.990 --> 03:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
disruptive to have bring in somebody who
 
03:33:41.189 --> 03:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
can put together a new marketing program
 
03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
a new marketing plan rather than just
 
03:33:46.590 --> 03:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
closing shop on everything that we have
 
03:33:48.510 --> 03:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
again this is just a commission to look
 
03:33:50.229 --> 03:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
at all those questions so if the
 
03:33:51.990 --> 03:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
commission was formed you could
 
03:33:53.630 --> 03:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
certainly go before the commission and
 
03:33:55.510 --> 03:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
raise those concerns before they issue
 
03:33:57.070 --> 03:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
their final
 
03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
report sure represent Gibbs thank you Mr
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
chair um this kind of a followup to
 
03:34:07.469 --> 03:34:07.479 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's question about
 
03:34:10.189 --> 03:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement um would it be expected that
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
the report of this commission would
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
include recommendations as to which
 
03:34:15.840 --> 03:34:17.349 align:start position:0%
include recommendations as to which
agency

03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
agency
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
or or would there be a separate agency
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
that would handle the enforcement
 
03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
functions if the liquor store function
 
03:34:27.710 --> 03:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
was privatized yes as you'll see in the
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
bill it's uh under section one C it
 
03:34:34.269 --> 03:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
talks about the department of safety
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
being involved in this commission as you
 
03:34:38.349 --> 03:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
know the department of safety takes care
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
of State Police and safety matters
 
03:34:42.030 --> 03:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
across the street and that's why I
 
03:34:43.389 --> 03:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
thought their involvement would be
 
03:34:44.790 --> 03:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
important because they could certainly
 
03:34:47.349 --> 03:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
speak to the enforc and cost of
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
enforcing liquor
 
03:34:49.439 --> 03:34:52.670 align:start position:0%
enforcing liquor
laws

03:34:52.670 --> 03:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:55.189 --> 03:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much nice to see you
 
03:34:57.389 --> 03:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman nice to see you and I'm glad
 
03:34:59.469 --> 03:34:59.479 align:start position:0%
to hear that you know your privatization
 
03:35:02.309 --> 03:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
was is more efficient and I'm sure you
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
could run an Trak cheaper than the
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
federal government well our friends as
 
03:35:09.309 --> 03:35:09.319 align:start position:0%
you know across the border we've talked
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
about this the MBTA is hundreds of
 
03:35:13.950 --> 03:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in debt
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:21.070 --> 03:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
John okay chair will call on marjerie
 
03:35:30.750 --> 03:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:35.309 --> 03:35:35.319 align:start position:0%
Bill good afternoon good a afternoon
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you it is always a pleasure to
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
appear before chairman Hunt's Commerce
 
03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
Committee um I'm delighted to be here
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
and I must begin by saying that I don't
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
agree with the prime
 
03:35:57.710 --> 03:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor excuse me um although I am a
 
03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and that to me is exactly why
 
03:36:05.870 --> 03:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
we need a commission seems to me that
 
03:36:08.950 --> 03:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
when people say it's not about the money
 
03:36:12.510 --> 03:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's about the money there is
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
no reason otherwise for the state to be
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the liquor business um it's just
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
about the money it's not because we want
 
03:36:23.030 --> 03:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people know that they
 
03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
should drink the right brand of bourbon
 
03:36:29.189 --> 03:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
um that's not why it's just for the
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
money for the money for the state and
 
03:36:34.110 --> 03:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
for the jobs that it creates and
 
03:36:34.120 --> 03:36:35.110 align:start position:0%
for the jobs that it creates and
anything

03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
else I think that I only see three
 
03:36:43.510 --> 03:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
people and I might be wrong who were in
 
03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:44.269 align:start position:0%
people and I might be wrong who were in
the

03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
legislature when when um under Governor
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh well Governor
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
hasson's interest in this issue um uh we
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
created an
 
03:36:57.120 --> 03:36:58.630 align:start position:0%
created an
Enterprise

03:36:58.630 --> 03:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
Enterprise
 
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
operation and there was only one reason
 
03:37:05.110 --> 03:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
to create an Enterprise operation it
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't to make sure that people were
 
03:37:10.790 --> 03:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
drinking safely it wasn't to make sure
 
03:37:13.030 --> 03:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
that rules were followed it was to
 
03:37:17.950 --> 03:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
generate money and the idea was that if
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission was free of the
 
03:37:24.189 --> 03:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
normal restrictions that a state agency
 
03:37:27.750 --> 03:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
has to follow they would be able to rake
 
03:37:31.150 --> 03:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
in enormous amounts of money I was never
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
particularly comfortable with that
 
03:37:35.670 --> 03:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
approach but that's the approach that we
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
took and if you look every
 
03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
year at at the reports of what has come
 
03:37:47.710 --> 03:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
in and what has gone out you will find
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
that that initial assumption has been
 
03:37:54.429 --> 03:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
proven to be incorrect we are spending
 
03:37:56.990 --> 03:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
more and more money and we are
 
03:38:00.550 --> 03:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
generating less and less Revenue so if
 
03:38:03.550 --> 03:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
the reason for us to be in the business
 
03:38:07.150 --> 03:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
is in order to get more money for the
 
03:38:09.630 --> 03:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
state we made a bad
 
03:38:12.670 --> 03:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
choice the reason I'm a co-sponsor of
 
03:38:12.680 --> 03:38:14.150 align:start position:0%
choice the reason I'm a co-sponsor of
this

03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill excuse is not because I think we
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
privatize um although there are people
 
03:38:24.510 --> 03:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
who are knowledgeable and think we will
 
03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
get a onetime only1
 
03:38:28.239 --> 03:38:32.750 align:start position:0%
get a onetime only1
billion

03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue excuse me I'm not ready for the
 
03:38:37.269 --> 03:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
03:38:40.830 --> 03:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
obviously um and this is a term when
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to need that $1 billion but
 
03:38:45.630 --> 03:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should privatize seems
 
03:38:47.389 --> 03:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
to me there three choices we can keep
 
03:38:51.389 --> 03:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
things as they are we can privatize or
 
03:38:55.469 --> 03:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
we can return to the days when the
 
03:38:58.349 --> 03:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
liquor operation of the state was part
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
of state government and we could control
 
03:39:03.550 --> 03:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
it that way we could see what was being
 
03:39:06.590 --> 03:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
spent and how decisions were being made
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
and we can't do that now so with three
 
03:39:13.790 --> 03:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
choices privatize keep things as they
 
03:39:16.990 --> 03:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
are or bring three obvious choices and
 
03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
bring um liquor back under the umbrella
 
03:39:22.349 --> 03:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
of the state it seems to me that the
 
03:39:24.910 --> 03:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
third choice is the one that I would
 
03:39:27.950 --> 03:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
prefer but I recognize that there might
 
03:39:31.150 --> 03:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
be a fourth or a fifth choice and I also
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
recognize um that there are a lot of
 
03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
variables all I can say today is we are
 
03:39:42.630 --> 03:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
not doing what we are supposed to be
 
03:39:46.110 --> 03:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
doing Visa liquor
 
03:39:49.389 --> 03:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
because we are not using the state
 
03:39:52.590 --> 03:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
involvement in selling liquor to provide
 
03:39:55.189 --> 03:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
the funds that we need for the rest of
 
03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
government to function and if we're not
 
03:40:01.870 --> 03:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
doing that then why are we doing it at
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
all because I don't think we really want
 
03:40:08.269 --> 03:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
to be in the liquor business do we um
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
well maybe some of you do but I think
 
03:40:14.269 --> 03:40:14.279 align:start position:0%
probably not we like the money right I
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
agree with that Mr Mr chairman and I
 
03:40:19.550 --> 03:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
know you and I agree on that completely
 
03:40:22.309 --> 03:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
my point is we're not getting the money
 
03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
that have been promised and in that case
 
03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
I think we need a new contract why would
 
03:40:31.710 --> 03:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
we stay in an arrangement that is not
 
03:40:36.990 --> 03:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
generating the revenue that we need in
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
proportion to the money that's coming
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
into the Liquor Commission and I think
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
we ought to figure out why and if we can
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
come up with a better alternative it
 
03:40:49.710 --> 03:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
seems to me we have an obligation to our
 
03:40:52.189 --> 03:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
constituents and to our responsibility
 
03:40:55.110 --> 03:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
to the state budget to make sure we are
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
getting as much for our buck as we
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
can and I think we have demonstrated
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
over the years that that is not what's
 
03:41:07.590 --> 03:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
happening we're getting less and less
 
03:41:12.349 --> 03:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
and um I hope that this committee
 
03:41:14.189 --> 03:41:14.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there's no reason for
 
03:41:16.189 --> 03:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
us to be in the liquor business except
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
for Revenue to the state not to The
 
03:41:20.950 --> 03:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission but to the state that
 
03:41:24.309 --> 03:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
we would then support this bill so I
 
03:41:28.510 --> 03:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the with the uh Prime
 
03:41:32.189 --> 03:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor but I do agree that a commission
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
fairly drawn with representation from
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
all the interesting parties might come
 
03:41:40.269 --> 03:41:40.279 align:start position:0%
up with a better answer than we have
 
03:41:43.790 --> 03:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrated up until now and as always
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
it's an honor to appear before you Mr
 
03:41:50.149 --> 03:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
chairman the honor is all all mine to
 
03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
have you here visiting us oh that's so
 
03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
kind of you to say I'm not sure I
 
03:41:56.790 --> 03:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
believe that but it is really kind of
 
03:41:59.229 --> 03:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
you to say we've known each other a very
 
03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
long time that is true ref Sam Ammon
 
03:42:04.389 --> 03:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
03:42:04.399 --> 03:42:06.349 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
testimony

03:42:06.349 --> 03:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:42:09.630 --> 03:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
um is it fair to say that there these
 
03:42:12.030 --> 03:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
concerns are are coming from the finance
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee it seems over the last few
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
years the finance committee has has come
 
03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
here with different bills concerning the
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is this bill sort of
 
03:42:22.990 --> 03:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
like does it
 
03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
represent a contingency in the finance
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
committee in your opinion well um I'm
 
03:42:30.510 --> 03:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
not sure that you know that I am not on
 
03:42:32.590 --> 03:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
the finance committee I was on the
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
finance committee for many years that is
 
03:42:38.149 --> 03:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
true but I am not on the finance
 
03:42:40.309 --> 03:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee now I'm on the Judiciary
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
Committee however like you I am
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
interested not only in the matters that
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
come before the committee I serve on but
 
03:42:52.590 --> 03:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in how the state is
 
03:42:55.590 --> 03:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
governed and you can take the girl off
 
03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
the finance committee but you can't take
 
03:43:01.990 --> 03:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
Finance concerns out of the girl and I
 
03:43:06.269 --> 03:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
look at the Liquor Commission and um Ru
 
03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
the day that the state chose to give
 
03:43:15.309 --> 03:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
up ordinary control of how liquor is
 
03:43:17.710 --> 03:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
governed in this state on a false
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
premise that we would be rolling in
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
money as a result and um or at least
 
03:43:27.070 --> 03:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
earning more money and that's why an
 
03:43:30.070 --> 03:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
Enterprise operation was created and I
 
03:43:33.389 --> 03:43:33.399 align:start position:0%
think we've proven that it's not it has
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
been proven that that's not quite
 
03:43:39.950 --> 03:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.790 --> 03:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
hoped represent
 
03:43:45.870 --> 03:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
spe uh seeing in the in the news that uh
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
the sale of liquor is down all over the
 
03:43:49.229 --> 03:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
country really and and it was mentioned
 
03:43:49.239 --> 03:43:51.870 align:start position:0%
country really and and it was mentioned
worldwide

03:43:51.870 --> 03:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
worldwide
 
03:43:54.510 --> 03:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
M uh the question of getting blood from
 
03:43:56.710 --> 03:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
a Stone comes out but but what I'm
 
03:43:59.349 --> 03:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
really concerned about is one of the
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
things I've seen in some of the results
 
03:44:03.389 --> 03:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
of the commissions and I read everything
 
03:44:06.990 --> 03:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
is that a premise that starts out is how
 
03:44:09.429 --> 03:44:09.439 align:start position:0%
the commission ends up that is a
 
03:44:11.349 --> 03:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
preconceived notion of how they want it
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
to go so commissions don't always come
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
out with valid results just as the idea
 
03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
of not of making it an Enterprise did
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
not work
 
03:44:25.229 --> 03:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
out um I'm wondering if and and I guess
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
the commission could decide if it was
 
03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
being open totally open-minded that
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
maybe what we have to do is just
 
03:44:33.229 --> 03:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
improving whatever the Liquor Commission
 
03:44:35.110 --> 03:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
is doing I I don't know how that would
 
03:44:38.630 --> 03:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
work out but I'm not I just don't I am
 
03:44:40.670 --> 03:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
not clear the idea that a private
 
03:44:42.870 --> 03:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
business runs better than a government
 
03:44:45.630 --> 03:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
business that doesn't always wash
 
03:44:47.149 --> 03:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm not clear
 
03:44:47.159 --> 03:44:50.510 align:start position:0%
so I'm not clear
on

03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:53.309 --> 03:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
where a private business and maybe you
 
03:44:55.469 --> 03:44:55.479 align:start position:0%
already agree that this may not be that
 
03:44:57.670 --> 03:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
a private business would ever do
 
03:44:59.830 --> 03:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
anything other than make the private
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
company make a lot of money and we the
 
03:45:03.630 --> 03:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
state may not make a thing on it which
 
03:45:06.429 --> 03:45:06.439 align:start position:0%
is what we more often see well I quite
 
03:45:09.229 --> 03:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
agree with you what I said early on is
 
03:45:11.349 --> 03:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
that I do not agree with the prime
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor that the answer is to privatize
 
03:45:16.269 --> 03:45:16.279 align:start position:0%
I think if we're going to be in liquor
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
business we ought to bring it back under
 
03:45:20.590 --> 03:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
the umbrella of state government that's
 
03:45:24.590 --> 03:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
what I think is the but I also will say
 
03:45:26.070 --> 03:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
that you're absolutely right I mean I
 
03:45:28.149 --> 03:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
think of the Articles of Confederation
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know they were just going to make a
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
few changes and they did make a few
 
03:45:33.429 --> 03:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
changes and now we have the Constitution
 
03:45:35.950 --> 03:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
of the United States so we have no idea
 
03:45:38.070 --> 03:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
what the commission is going to do and I
 
03:45:41.149 --> 03:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
hope the commission might be better than
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of us who have been involved in
 
03:45:46.110 --> 03:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
trying to solve this problem and come up
 
03:45:48.510 --> 03:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
with a new idea a better way of doing it
 
03:45:50.110 --> 03:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
I think that would be great I don't know
 
03:45:52.630 --> 03:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
if that will happen or not I see three
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
obvious choices there might be more and
 
03:45:58.870 --> 03:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
I think a good commission under good
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
leadership perhaps of chairman hun will
 
03:46:06.429 --> 03:46:06.439 align:start position:0%
be very open-minded about this um uh
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
might come up with a really great idea
 
03:46:12.030 --> 03:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
of how we can in fact use our limited
 
03:46:15.469 --> 03:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
resources to benefit the state not to
 
03:46:17.149 --> 03:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
benefit the Liquor Commission but to
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
benefit the state uh and I don't know
 
03:46:21.950 --> 03:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
what the answer is if I knew what the
 
03:46:24.149 --> 03:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
answer is I would file a bill and say
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is the answer I don't know that I
 
03:46:29.030 --> 03:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
do know I don't agree that privatization
 
03:46:31.590 --> 03:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
is the best way to go I don't know I'm
 
03:46:33.269 --> 03:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
not looking behind me to see what the
 
03:46:35.790 --> 03:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor's face looks like but
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's okay we'll still be
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
friends it's always
 
03:46:42.870 --> 03:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
R representative M uh thank you
 
03:46:45.429 --> 03:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner um and thank you for taking
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
question I haven't been around all that
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
long to understand what what you you
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
were just saying you know bring it back
 
03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
to the state are you talking about the
 
03:46:57.309 --> 03:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
fact that it once you had to buy all
 
03:46:59.950 --> 03:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
your wine and liquor at a state store
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
and now we have retail stores that are
 
03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
private businesses is that what you mean
 
03:47:06.429 --> 03:47:06.439 align:start position:0%
by bringing it back um that's a good
 
03:47:09.510 --> 03:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
question um representative mward I mean
 
03:47:13.710 --> 03:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
is not the decisions that would be made
 
03:47:15.469 --> 03:47:15.479 align:start position:0%
but the governance
 
03:47:18.149 --> 03:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
of uh those people who are making the
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
decisions it might be that we've now
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
seen that being able to buy wine and
 
03:47:26.110 --> 03:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
beer you can buy you can tell what I buy
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
and don't buy wine and beer in grocery
 
03:47:30.149 --> 03:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
stores right yeah okay that's what I
 
03:47:33.229 --> 03:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
thought um
 
03:47:35.790 --> 03:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me
 
03:47:39.309 --> 03:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
um it might be that
 
03:47:41.229 --> 03:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
um with a
 
03:47:43.630 --> 03:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
new management
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
approach um
 
03:47:49.070 --> 03:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
that part of delivery of the product
 
03:47:52.030 --> 03:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
might stay the same what I mean is that
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
before we took the Liquor Commission
 
03:47:59.790 --> 03:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
outside of of state
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
agencies which happened when we created
 
03:48:05.550 --> 03:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
an Enterprise
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
operation there was some degree of
 
03:48:12.030 --> 03:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
control within state government of how
 
03:48:14.149 --> 03:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission functioned and how
 
03:48:15.950 --> 03:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
the money was spent and how the money
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
was accounted for and how decisions were
 
03:48:23.550 --> 03:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
being made um and um so that's just one
 
03:48:26.550 --> 03:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
alternative I'm not advocating for that
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not advocating certainly for the
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
privatization um I'm not opposing
 
03:48:34.349 --> 03:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
keeping things as they are what I'm
 
03:48:39.149 --> 03:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
saying is we have evidence that is in
 
03:48:43.269 --> 03:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
controvertible that liquor sales as we
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
have known them in the state of are not
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
doing what we had expected they would do
 
03:48:50.070 --> 03:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
and it's time to look at them and see if
 
03:48:52.189 --> 03:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
we can do it better there are a lot of
 
03:48:55.229 --> 03:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
ways of generating money for state
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
government some ways I wouldn't be
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
foolish enough to mention to let the
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
words fall from my lips but there are
 
03:49:05.710 --> 03:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
other Alternatives let's say there are
 
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
no other Alternatives and in that case
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
we've got to look at what's available to
 
03:49:14.110 --> 03:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
us under the uh the social construct
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
that we have in in the state and try to
 
03:49:19.910 --> 03:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
to get as much money out of the stone as
 
03:49:19.920 --> 03:49:21.309 align:start position:0%
to get as much money out of the stone as
we

03:49:21.309 --> 03:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:49:24.510 --> 03:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
can represent Sullivan thank you for
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you said the
 
03:49:28.630 --> 03:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
basically this is all about money and
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
getting more money for the state I'm
 
03:49:33.389 --> 03:49:33.399 align:start position:0%
curious if obviously you believe that
 
03:49:35.229 --> 03:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
but is that really what all we're
 
03:49:37.950 --> 03:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
looking at because you could certainly
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
make an argument that there are other
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
things that matter like the service to
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
communities that may be underserved you
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
know thinking up where I live in the
 
03:49:48.990 --> 03:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
northern part of the State uh I had some
 
03:49:52.429 --> 03:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
friends visiting and we were in a town
 
03:49:54.149 --> 03:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to go get a bottle of
 
03:49:56.750 --> 03:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
vodka that night and we had to drive
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
over half hour to go do that from where
 
03:50:03.309 --> 03:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
we were at that time and so I wonder
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
if if judging things simply on revenue
 
03:50:10.710 --> 03:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
for the state is the most appropriate
 
03:50:14.790 --> 03:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
when maybe uh in a a larger City it's
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal but in a more rural
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
area if you have to drive through
 
03:50:20.910 --> 03:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
several towns to just get a bottle of of
 
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
vodka um I there's another metric by
 
03:50:26.990 --> 03:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
which maybe we should be judging things
 
03:50:30.030 --> 03:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
on well that might very well be but I'm
 
03:50:34.349 --> 03:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
not sure that um and I I'm quite
 
03:50:36.990 --> 03:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
sympathetic not only just truthfully in
 
03:50:39.149 --> 03:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
terms of vodka I'm also sympathetic in
 
03:50:42.670 --> 03:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
terms of grocery stores and other retail
 
03:50:45.070 --> 03:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
outlets that aren't as available in
 
03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
rural areas as they should be and there
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
economic discrimination factors that
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
come into to play here and Geographic
 
03:50:53.319 --> 03:50:54.870 align:start position:0%
come into to play here and Geographic
discrimination

03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
03:50:58.110 --> 03:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
factors there's nothing that says that
 
03:50:58.120 --> 03:50:59.149 align:start position:0%
factors there's nothing that says that
any

03:50:59.149 --> 03:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:51:01.630 --> 03:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
alternative would or wouldn't address
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
your concern the reason the state is
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
involved is to generate
 
03:51:12.429 --> 03:51:12.439 align:start position:0%
revenue and it is that
 
03:51:15.790 --> 03:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
concern that I you know that that I face
 
03:51:19.750 --> 03:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's not as if we govern in any way you
 
03:51:22.269 --> 03:51:22.279 align:start position:0%
know who drinks and who doesn't um in
 
03:51:25.189 --> 03:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
states where the state isn't involved in
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
this way you know people are carded
 
03:51:30.269 --> 03:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
actually I was carded the other day in a
 
03:51:32.149 --> 03:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
drug store and I thought that was really
 
03:51:34.710 --> 03:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
pretty funny I mean you know really I
 
03:51:37.910 --> 03:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
was buying something for this cough and
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
I was CED I that was interesting and I
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
was told if they got caught not carding
 
03:51:46.750 --> 03:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
me they'd be in trouble I said at any
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
age they said well
 
03:51:52.149 --> 03:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
65 and I said yeah but I'm
 
03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
83 um anyway my point is there'll be
 
03:51:58.910 --> 03:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
certain certain checks that take place
 
03:52:00.910 --> 03:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
whoever owns and operates a liquor
 
03:52:03.910 --> 03:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
stores the purpose is to generate
 
03:52:06.149 --> 03:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
revenue and we ought to make sure we're
 
03:52:08.710 --> 03:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
getting the most that we can get as long
 
03:52:11.590 --> 03:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
as we're not willing to open up
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves to other opportunities for how
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to I don't know how many of
 
03:52:19.110 --> 03:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
you watched what happened yesterday in
 
03:52:21.670 --> 03:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
um ways and means when the
 
03:52:24.990 --> 03:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful um Michael Kaine who's our
 
03:52:27.550 --> 03:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant talked
 
03:52:31.910 --> 03:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
about the shortage of available funds in
 
03:52:35.590 --> 03:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
the current fiscal year forget about
 
03:52:37.349 --> 03:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the next two
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal years we have a problem and I
 
03:52:42.510 --> 03:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
think we ought to figure out how we can
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
get as much as we can to make the state
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
able to meet the needs of all the
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
citizens in the state whether they're in
 
03:52:53.229 --> 03:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
big cities or towns or all the way up on
 
03:52:57.790 --> 03:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
border um uh it's up to you you know I
 
03:53:05.790 --> 03:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
we always enjoy your
 
03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
thoughts oh Mr chairman that is lovely
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
you I was interested that one of your
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
members referred to you as commissioner
 
03:53:18.070 --> 03:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
title we we I am a chairman and
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
fortunately the they don't have a
 
03:53:25.590 --> 03:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner they also have a chairman
 
03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
so we do say hello to each other as Mr
 
03:53:33.950 --> 03:53:33.960 align:start position:0%

03:53:39.429 --> 03:53:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh I did it again didn't I sorry thank
 
03:53:42.269 --> 03:53:42.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thanks for a question
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
well I I guess uh based on what you
 
03:53:48.110 --> 03:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
spoke so far looks like from a business
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
perspective yeah I mean the only
 
03:53:52.590 --> 03:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
objective is to get as much S as
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
possible as money Revenue as possible
 
03:53:59.189 --> 03:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
but uh have you thought about the social
 
03:54:03.469 --> 03:54:03.479 align:start position:0%
implications of uh liquor cells have you
 
03:54:05.429 --> 03:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
do you give any importance to that at
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
all in your decisions representative
 
03:54:11.110 --> 03:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
that is a very sensitive question that
 
03:54:13.149 --> 03:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
you've asked and I'm glad that you asked
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
it I think all of us
 
03:54:19.189 --> 03:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
are concerned about appropriate use of
 
03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
um of alcohol of cigarettes of drugs of
 
03:54:27.070 --> 03:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want to mention it but of do I
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
say cannabis or marijuana which is the
 
03:54:31.110 --> 03:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
more appropriate term Mr chair we do
 
03:54:33.189 --> 03:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
refer it as cannabis here okay then I
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
want to refer to it the way you do all
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
of that is absolutely important and
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
there's no question about it but I'm
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
here before the Commerce Committee I'm
 
03:54:46.590 --> 03:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
not here before um the health committee
 
03:54:46.600 --> 03:54:48.510 align:start position:0%
not here before um the health committee
and

03:54:48.510 --> 03:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
um we're here because selling liquor is
 
03:54:55.229 --> 03:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
a business that is important to the
 
03:55:00.149 --> 03:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
state and um nothing that we're talking
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
about here has to do with our own social
 
03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility which is a very real
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility but the other thing I do
 
03:55:11.349 --> 03:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
want to mention is when I first joined
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature before most of you were
 
03:55:16.429 --> 03:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
born um not all but most I'm looking
 
03:55:18.189 --> 03:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
around maybe that's not true actually in
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
this committee but pretty close
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
um we were we were a Libertarian State
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
and in the classic use of the word
 
03:55:31.790 --> 03:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
libertarian which meant we wanted people
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to live their own lives
 
03:55:37.469 --> 03:55:37.479 align:start position:0%
without interference of the state and I
 
03:55:39.469 --> 03:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
was very comfortable with that I had no
 
03:55:42.429 --> 03:55:42.439 align:start position:0%
problem even though at that point
 
03:55:43.950 --> 03:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
basically since Adam and Eve there had
 
03:55:46.510 --> 03:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
never been a democratic majority in the
 
03:55:49.830 --> 03:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
house um and it was a number of years
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
before finally there was um but the
 
03:55:53.479 --> 03:55:54.550 align:start position:0%
before finally there was um but the
social

03:55:54.550 --> 03:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
social
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility hasn't changed I think we
 
03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
do have responsibility to ourselves and
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
our community that's how I've governed
 
03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
my life that's not what this is about
 
03:56:06.149 --> 03:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
this is about why do we have the current
 
03:56:09.510 --> 03:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
structure of the Liquor Commission and
 
03:56:11.469 --> 03:56:11.479 align:start position:0%
if we have it in order to generate as
 
03:56:13.830 --> 03:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
much money as possible I think the time
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
has come
 
03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
to get some people together who will
 
03:56:19.590 --> 03:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
seriously say is there a better way to
 
03:56:22.910 --> 03:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
do it and maybe there isn't let's let's
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
have that
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you fair enough thank
 
03:56:28.830 --> 03:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for asking the
 
03:56:31.349 --> 03:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you it's always a
 
03:56:35.710 --> 03:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
pleasure seeing you am I finished we are
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I hope you find
 
03:56:40.510 --> 03:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to invite
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
me I think you made this opportunity
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
available to
 
03:56:47.630 --> 03:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay chair will'll call on the other
 
03:56:49.710 --> 03:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
chairman Joe mikica from the New
 
03:57:33.389 --> 03:57:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record I'm Joe
 
03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%

03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and with me is our CFO
 
03:58:07.199 --> 03:58:08.189 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and with me is our CFO
Tina

03:58:08.189 --> 03:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
Tina
 
03:58:11.590 --> 03:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
deir uh we briefly will just we'll go
 
03:58:14.229 --> 03:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
through the the packet but uh just
 
03:58:16.510 --> 03:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
quickly because there has been some uh
 
03:58:19.469 --> 03:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
questions on the sales of liquor and the
 
03:58:22.349 --> 03:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
sales of cannabis I just want to briefly
 
03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
give a few
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh historical little historical data on
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
it so as I had spoken in front of the
 
03:58:32.309 --> 03:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
committee the other day for the first
 
03:58:35.189 --> 03:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
time in 30 years in the United States uh
 
03:58:37.630 --> 03:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a drop in alcohol so that's
 
03:58:42.189 --> 03:58:42.199 align:start position:0%
a 30-year run of increase and since 2023
 
03:58:46.630 --> 03:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a drop we uh a five a 2.9%
 
03:58:49.349 --> 03:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
drop in
 
03:58:53.429 --> 03:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
2023 an additional drop in 2024 of about
 
03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
two two and a half% and uh closing out
 
03:59:01.149 --> 03:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
in 2025 nationally they're uh the figure
 
03:59:03.790 --> 03:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
from sip source is about
 
03:59:06.670 --> 03:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
5.6% alcohol decline in the United
 
03:59:09.469 --> 03:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
States over these those three years
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
after a 30-year increase and as far as
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis is concerned and again I'll
 
03:59:17.149 --> 03:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
premise this by The Liquor Commission is
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
not pro or against cannabis but 44% of
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
the people over 21 in the United States
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
today are using cannabis on a daily
 
03:59:29.070 --> 03:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
basis instead of
 
03:59:32.790 --> 03:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol so on page two I'll show you the
 
03:59:36.030 --> 03:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
17 control States and as uh the chairman
 
03:59:38.469 --> 03:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
had brought up the last time we have a
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
note on the bottom that we have some
 
03:59:40.000 --> 03:59:40.990 align:start position:0%
note on the bottom that we have some
local

03:59:40.990 --> 03:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
local
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that are there with the uh
 
03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
the dots in the states that uh are in uh
 
03:59:49.630 --> 03:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
Alaska Maryland Minnesota and South
 
03:59:52.510 --> 03:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
Dakota so 17 control states in the
 
03:59:54.910 --> 03:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
United States and here in New England we
 
03:59:57.710 --> 03:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
have Maine and Vermont uh we are the
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
only control state that controls the
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
sale of alcohol uh exclusively
 
04:00:06.670 --> 04:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania is our closest uh
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
counterpart and they have some State
 
04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
stores and some private stores as
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
well so I'll move on to uh page three
 
04:00:20.189 --> 04:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
some nabca which is the national Alcohol
 
04:00:22.990 --> 04:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
Beverage Control Association which all
 
04:00:26.349 --> 04:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
control states are a member of uh just
 
04:00:30.189 --> 04:00:30.199 align:start position:0%
quickly we see that on the first bullet
 
04:00:33.469 --> 04:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
revenue from uh the sale of alcohol in
 
04:00:35.469 --> 04:00:35.479 align:start position:0%
control States the revenue is given to
 
04:00:38.429 --> 04:00:38.439 align:start position:0%
local governments and M municipalities
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
and other important Endeavors here in
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission we not only Supply
 
04:00:47.670 --> 04:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
the general fund with uh Revenue but we
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
also Supply HHS and uh with Revenue in
 
04:00:54.070 --> 04:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
two additional sources which we'll get
 
04:00:57.790 --> 04:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
into in the second in the in a few
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
seconds so uh bullets 2 three and four
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
are related to Public Safety control
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
systems that oversee retail sale
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
generally see a lower results in alcohol
 
04:01:14.269 --> 04:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
density which means stores in the state
 
04:01:17.950 --> 04:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
that serve alcohol the next bullet one
 
04:01:20.510 --> 04:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the advantages control States is not
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
selling to underage people the our our
 
04:01:30.510 --> 04:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh participation with the lenses is done
 
04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
hand inand and with our stores as
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
well then you'll see a Level Playing
 
04:01:39.710 --> 04:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
Field for competitive beverage
 
04:01:42.870 --> 04:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol um we're here to protect our
 
04:01:45.550 --> 04:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
communities from oversaturation of
 
04:01:48.030 --> 04:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol and selling
 
04:01:51.149 --> 04:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
locations the next bullet it benefits
 
04:01:54.750 --> 04:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
producers which is uh instate producers
 
04:01:58.149 --> 04:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
of alcohol Spirits wine then those
 
04:02:01.389 --> 04:02:01.399 align:start position:0%
producers uh we approve the sales a lot
 
04:02:03.870 --> 04:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
of companies will start in control
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
States and one of the success stories in
 
04:02:10.149 --> 04:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
this state is Fabia lemonchello in Salem
 
04:02:13.950 --> 04:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
Phil Phil mastriani he was unable to get
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
his product into an open state they're
 
04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
not going to take it they won't take the
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
chance on an unknown product in the
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
control States we do that every day of
 
04:02:25.950 --> 04:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
the week Brian from flag Hill is a is a
 
04:02:28.750 --> 04:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
prime a prime person and could speak to
 
04:02:31.750 --> 04:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
it but Phil from F breia has built his
 
04:02:34.030 --> 04:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
business here starting in New Hampshire
 
04:02:37.510 --> 04:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
because we gave the small guy a chance
 
04:02:40.269 --> 04:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
an open State I owned licenses in two
 
04:02:42.429 --> 04:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
other open States New Jersey and
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they're not not going to
 
04:02:47.550 --> 04:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
allow a small a small unknown person to
 
04:02:49.469 --> 04:02:49.479 align:start position:0%
come into the business the way it would
 
04:02:52.229 --> 04:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
happen in a control State and the last
 
04:02:54.910 --> 04:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
piece is that we control the the
 
04:02:57.870 --> 04:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
transportation of alcohol so the alcohol
 
04:03:00.630 --> 04:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
is held in one warehouse in New
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have our old Warehouse down
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
on store Street where we hold some of
 
04:03:09.429 --> 04:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
the non-alcoholic products and some of
 
04:03:14.590 --> 04:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
our one-time power buys but 94% 90 5% of
 
04:03:17.429 --> 04:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
our product is held under one roof and
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
is done by one transporter to our
 
04:03:23.550 --> 04:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
locations and those 62 or three
 
04:03:26.269 --> 04:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
locations are all state controlled and
 
04:03:30.510 --> 04:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
state run there's a reason why those are
 
04:03:32.429 --> 04:03:32.439 align:start position:0%
set up the way that they are because
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
it's a control center for alcohol it's a
 
04:03:38.189 --> 04:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
destination that people have to go to
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
and the the uh criteria of H buying
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
Brickley on page three you'll see the
 
04:03:52.189 --> 04:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
three-tier system on page four so I'm
 
04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
sorry on page four and then on page five
 
04:03:56.750 --> 04:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see the value of the Tre
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
three-tier system Financial Independence
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
functional Independence Revenue
 
04:04:06.429 --> 04:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
collection and here's the key product
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
tracking we don't hear about counterfeit
 
04:04:11.710 --> 04:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
or tainted alcohol in the United States
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
very rarely but in other countries it
 
04:04:17.070 --> 04:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
happens all the time people are killed
 
04:04:19.870 --> 04:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
on Vaca on vacations people die while
 
04:04:22.830 --> 04:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
they're traveling why is that because a
 
04:04:25.630 --> 04:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
controll jurisdiction takes control of
 
04:04:27.790 --> 04:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
the product from the minute it enters
 
04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
the state to the minute it's sold to
 
04:04:32.149 --> 04:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
Consumers everything that goes through
 
04:04:33.630 --> 04:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
those warehouses and through those
 
04:04:36.149 --> 04:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
stores are products that we've
 
04:04:39.149 --> 04:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
evaluated and our suppliers and our
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
Brokers have evaluated so in 2024 just
 
04:04:44.349 --> 04:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
for some quick
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
statistics 1,200 people were affected by
 
04:04:50.149 --> 04:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
tainted alcohol methanol contained
 
04:04:56.309 --> 04:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
alcohol 400 are dead in The Last 5 Years
 
04:04:58.990 --> 04:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
11,800 people have been affected by
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
tainted alcohol 4500 are dead the
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
control system clearly has its
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
advantages on page seven you'll see that
 
04:05:18.670 --> 04:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
we we now have a, 10 employees 237 are
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
full-time 640 are part-time one of the
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
questions I've heard what happens to
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
those employees when a private person
 
04:05:28.269 --> 04:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
Takes Over The Liquor Commission I can
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
tell you what happens I was a business
 
04:05:33.070 --> 04:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
person in Private Industry for 30 years
 
04:05:35.550 --> 04:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
those employees are let go that's the
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
bottom line and those those people that
 
04:05:40.950 --> 04:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
take over those licenses whether it's
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
one person or whether it's 10 and I can
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
see seriously tell you it's not going to
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
be one because no one person is going to
 
04:05:51.189 --> 04:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
come in and pay you a billion dollars or
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
whatever number it might be for your
 
04:05:55.630 --> 04:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
business and then you're going to allow
 
04:05:58.110 --> 04:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
them to have an open market so where's
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
the value and what they're buying if
 
04:06:01.469 --> 04:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
exclusivity there is no value in what
 
04:06:06.070 --> 04:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
they're buying because they don't have
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
exclusivity you're opening it up
 
04:06:13.349 --> 04:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
to stores on every corner stores you'll
 
04:06:15.229 --> 04:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
be opening it up to a plethora of
 
04:06:17.670 --> 04:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol being available to Consumers
 
04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
around the state take a look at
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts our friendly open state to
 
04:06:25.469 --> 04:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
the South and you can see what's going
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
to happen in New Hampshire you won't
 
04:06:31.229 --> 04:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
have 62 or 65 locations you'll have
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
hundreds of locations where alcohol is
 
04:06:36.149 --> 04:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
available now we have beer and wine
 
04:06:38.030 --> 04:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's available in stores in the states
 
04:06:39.790 --> 04:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
and we recognize that in the grocery
 
04:06:42.670 --> 04:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
stores happen to do happy to do a
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
partnership with them
 
04:06:47.229 --> 04:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
but as commissioner Earl Sweeney used to
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
say it's the difference between
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
firecrackers and dynamite that's the
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
difference you can see the breakdown of
 
04:06:58.269 --> 04:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
the commission below the office of the
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
commission the division of enforcement
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
the division of administration and the
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
division of marketing and uh
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
merchandising and the corresponding
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
employees that go along with each this
 
04:07:14.149 --> 04:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
commission is run very efficiently
 
04:07:16.229 --> 04:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh with
 
04:07:19.229 --> 04:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
237 full-time employees that's in the
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
store I'm sorry in the out well in the
 
04:07:24.149 --> 04:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
outlets thank you Tina 340
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
371 employees with enforcement all of HQ
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
and in the stores we have augmented with
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
part-time for many many years as was the
 
04:07:36.750 --> 04:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
request of the
 
04:07:40.750 --> 04:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and on page nine uh Tina can
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
go through where the money goes
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
on page eight though you'll see that
 
04:07:48.149 --> 04:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's just a breakdown of each of the
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
divisions responsibilities so you know
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
what each division
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
does so on page nine is just a five-year
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
net profit transfer history in the five
 
04:08:01.109 --> 04:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
years we've transferred $
 
04:08:04.109 --> 04:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
7792 million
 
04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
6949 million to the general fund there
 
04:08:07.000 --> 04:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
6949 million to the general fund there
was

04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%

04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
$29.6 that came from liquor operations
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
65.3 million came from beer operations

fund and since the Liquor Commission has
 
04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
been in operation we've trans we've
 
04:08:29.479 --> 04:08:31.030 align:start position:0%
been in operation we've trans we've
produced

04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
produced
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
4.67 billion in revenue and since 2016
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
we've transferred 106 million to Health
 
04:08:41.109 --> 04:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
and Human Services for those two other
 
04:08:41.119 --> 04:08:44.469 align:start position:0%
and Human Services for those two other
funds

04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh just quickly our our charitable
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
contributions and that's through our
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%

those events $4.3 million to nonprofits
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
since 5 and then some of the awards that
 
04:09:18.389 --> 04:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission has won some
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
accolades that we've been given over
 
04:09:23.950 --> 04:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
over the years the past years none more
 
04:09:27.910 --> 04:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
important than being uh by state ways
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
magazine being the top control State or
 
04:09:35.710 --> 04:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
the only control state in the top 10
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
five years in a row this business is run
 
04:09:45.149 --> 04:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:45.159 --> 04:09:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
disagreeing

04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
testimony so and the only other piece I
 
04:09:54.750 --> 04:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
would add is uh
 
04:09:57.469 --> 04:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
quickly if we are if this is something
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
that we're that we're going to look at
 
04:10:03.030 --> 04:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh it was interesting to me in
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
establishing a study Commission of
 
04:10:07.389 --> 04:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
privatizing the Liquor Commission that
 
04:10:11.550 --> 04:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't have anybody on the committee
 
04:10:13.950 --> 04:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
that was in the business
 
04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's no one here from the New
 
04:10:18.870 --> 04:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Brokers Association which are
 
04:10:20.910 --> 04:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
private brokers in the state in the
 
04:10:23.070 --> 04:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
state that employ people here in the
 
04:10:25.550 --> 04:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
state hundreds of people I might add
 
04:10:26.830 --> 04:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
there's no one here from the New
 
04:10:29.309 --> 04:10:29.319 align:start position:0%

04:10:38.670 --> 04:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
beer wholesalers Association again three

question your
 
04:11:07.149 --> 04:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:07.159 --> 04:11:09.469 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
hello um thanks for uh that information
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
it was it was very good uh I I I
 
04:11:18.189 --> 04:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
actually did the advertising for the
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission for four years years
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
ago and we rolled out the wine uh effort
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
which was I hope uh profitable it's done
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's done very well thank you but the
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
thing uh uh my question to you
 
04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
is uh does anything come to mind right
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
now while you're sitting that you would
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
like to take a look at on your own and
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
make some recommendations to where you
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
think we might be able to uh you know uh
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
have a higher profit margin or have more
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
sales or that kind sort of thing U and I
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
have a question what was the advertising
 
04:12:04.950 --> 04:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
agency um portion how much in
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
advertising did you make in the last
 
04:12:09.109 --> 04:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
couple years how much did we spend in
 
04:12:11.469 --> 04:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
advertising uh the the contract has been
 
04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
held by weedo uh out of Manchester for
 
04:12:17.469 --> 04:12:17.479 align:start position:0%
several years and I believe the contract
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
is for a 5-year contract for a total of
 
04:12:25.469 --> 04:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
$ 2.86 million 2.86 yeah I can find out
 
04:12:29.630 --> 04:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
that exact it's 2.5 I'm sorry 2.5
 
04:12:31.550 --> 04:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
annually okay that's that's good
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
information and U and I know there are
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
things you can do uh in terms of uh um
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
displays in terms of advertising in
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
terms of uh costs U prices you could you
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
could literally raise the prices on
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
alcohol if you wanted to or and or if
 
04:12:54.149 --> 04:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
you needed to but uh um I I go back to
 
04:12:58.030 --> 04:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
my original question and that is uh what
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
what would be number one for you in this
 
04:13:03.710 --> 04:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
particular at this particular time well
 
04:13:06.070 --> 04:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
when we met with Governor aot the other
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
day one of the things that I was asked
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
was to look through where we where she
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
thinks we could find some efficiency
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
and uh find some additional profits and
 
04:13:18.109 --> 04:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's an exercise that we're going
 
04:13:20.109 --> 04:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
through right now it's something that we
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
started about a year and a half ago and
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to share that information
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
with the committee uh as as we take it
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
forward but the one of the biggest
 
04:13:33.070 --> 04:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
things that we have to realize is this
 
04:13:35.710 --> 04:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
isn't a New Hampshire thing this is a
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
nationwide and really a
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
worldwide uh Dynamic that's causing
 
04:13:44.670 --> 04:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol and wine as well as alcohol to
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
sell less across the world there's been
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of hectar of wine of Vineyards
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
torn up in France there's been thousands
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
of hectares of Vineyards in South
 
04:13:57.429 --> 04:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
America Australia New Zealand that are
 
04:14:00.269 --> 04:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
being torn up because the cash crop of
 
04:14:02.670 --> 04:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
of grapes isn't what it used to be and
 
04:14:05.429 --> 04:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
we have a glut of wine and tanks in
 
04:14:08.469 --> 04:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
California so the industry in general is
 
04:14:11.070 --> 04:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
seeing a downturn that's due to a number
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
of reasons one of which is cannabis one
 
04:14:18.870 --> 04:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
is W of which is the uh the health
 
04:14:21.189 --> 04:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
benefits of wine or the not health
 
04:14:23.429 --> 04:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
benefits of wine and spirits that we're
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
seeing uh the Surgeon General came out
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
the other day and said any amount of
 
04:14:30.830 --> 04:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
alcohol causes cancer well that that
 
04:14:32.309 --> 04:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
puts a little bit of scare in the
 
04:14:34.750 --> 04:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
business and you'll see that suppliers
 
04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
are concerned about it as well as
 
04:14:39.109 --> 04:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
retailers and the other piece is the
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
Baby Boomers aging out of the market
 
04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
that is a big segment of the alcohol
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
Market they grew up with alcohol in
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
their lives with their grandparents and
 
04:14:50.590 --> 04:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
parents that's the that's those are the
 
04:14:53.070 --> 04:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
people that covered they bought for
 
04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the Gen Z the Gen X they they
 
04:14:58.229 --> 04:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
don't buy for tomorrow they're different
 
04:15:00.109 --> 04:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
they're buying patterns are different
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't stock in they
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
don't coverboard they buy better but
 
04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
they don't buy as often so the the
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
differentiation is
 
04:15:14.189 --> 04:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
huge um I have a thank you for that
 
04:15:17.910 --> 04:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
information are you um didn't the state
 
04:15:19.349 --> 04:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
at one
 
04:15:24.109 --> 04:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
time do all the distribution of uh of
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
product and are you still doing that are
 
04:15:30.309 --> 04:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
are the all the cars and trucks and and
 
04:15:32.269 --> 04:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things the warehouse are
 
04:15:34.710 --> 04:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
they state-owned and operated or is it
 
04:15:38.349 --> 04:15:38.359 align:start position:0%
are they private uh vendors all of our
 
04:15:40.269 --> 04:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
product is transferred from our
 
04:15:42.630 --> 04:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
warehouse in Bow and we have a 20year

alcohol to all of our stores and to the
 
04:15:55.710 --> 04:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
lenses the the only piece of it that DHL
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
does not control is there's some private
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
vendors such as law law Logistics and
 
04:16:05.109 --> 04:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
others that that distribute that product
 
04:16:08.149 --> 04:16:08.159 align:start position:0%

DHL to our stores thanks for your
 
04:16:26.189 --> 04:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
information thank you representative
 
04:16:29.469 --> 04:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
miles thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question sure I first
 
04:16:34.030 --> 04:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
would like to commend you on the safety
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
implementations with the product
 
04:16:38.469 --> 04:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
tracking um that's very significant and
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh we appreciate that for the safety of
 
04:16:43.030 --> 04:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents um I'd also like
 
04:16:44.429 --> 04:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
to thank you for the extensive
 
04:16:48.109 --> 04:16:48.119 align:start position:0%
charitable donations that you um provide
 
04:16:50.429 --> 04:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
my one question is if the Liquor
 
04:16:53.109 --> 04:16:53.119 align:start position:0%
Commission was to be privatized we would
 
04:16:53.119 --> 04:16:53.990 align:start position:0%
Commission was to be privatized we would
clearly

04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
lose a minimum of 371 full-time jobs
 
04:17:00.309 --> 04:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
most likely wouldn't that also mean that
 
04:17:02.590 --> 04:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
we would also lose all of those people
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
would lose their health insurance
 
04:17:06.590 --> 04:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
benefits which are so valuable to our
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents they would
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
certainly lose their state health
 
04:17:11.550 --> 04:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
insurance benefits thank which are
 
04:17:15.189 --> 04:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
immensely valuable in fact as costly
 
04:17:17.790 --> 04:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes or more than costly than the
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
salaries of those employees especially
 
04:17:23.710 --> 04:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:25.750 --> 04:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
families representative
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thanks St for my question
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
and don't view this as me having an
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
opinion on this I'm actually just kind
 
04:17:32.720 --> 04:17:34.309 align:start position:0%
opinion on this I'm actually just kind
of

04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:17:36.710 --> 04:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
curious if what you're saying is true
 
04:17:37.870 --> 04:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
which I have no reason to believe it's
 
04:17:39.950 --> 04:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
not with respect to the falling number
 
04:17:42.269 --> 04:17:42.279 align:start position:0%
of alcohol sales we're doing Nationwide
 
04:17:45.109 --> 04:17:45.119 align:start position:0%
worldwide sounds like
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
um I wonder
 
04:17:51.710 --> 04:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
if if you guys or this commission or
 
04:17:53.429 --> 04:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
somebody in the state needs to think
 
04:17:56.149 --> 04:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
about what the future looks like
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that you
 
04:18:00.550 --> 04:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
generally want to sell a business
 
04:18:02.510 --> 04:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
potentially that's what is on the table
 
04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
here sort of when it's at its top you
 
04:18:06.830 --> 04:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
know highest price you you know if
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're selling stock you sell it when
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
you think it's at its peak right um so
 
04:18:12.510 --> 04:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
if that were something that were to be
 
04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
ser iously considered um and right
 
04:18:18.750 --> 04:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
now what you laid out sounded a bit dire
 
04:18:21.870 --> 04:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to Falling revenues and and
 
04:18:24.349 --> 04:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
patterns among gen ZZ Millennials all
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
and you know cannabis taking away sales
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
the health concerns uh it it it seems
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
like I'd be curious if you guys have a
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
plan what you view the future to look
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
like and if if if it really does look
 
04:18:44.109 --> 04:18:44.119 align:start position:0%
like the future is grim for this um is
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate to consider cashing
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
out for the state now while the value of
 
04:18:50.950 --> 04:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
this business is as high as it perhaps
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
will ever be again I don't actually have
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
an opinion on what we should do I'm just
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
actually kind of curious about if
 
04:18:59.710 --> 04:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
anybody's even thought about it in that
 
04:19:02.109 --> 04:19:02.119 align:start position:0%
lens just based on the statistics you
 
04:19:05.229 --> 04:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
laid out here which sound concerning to
 
04:19:08.469 --> 04:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
me well I think like any industry uh
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
business goes through Trends you see you
 
04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
see Trends in business it's a it's a
 
04:19:16.229 --> 04:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
natural uh it's a natural evolution of
 
04:19:19.710 --> 04:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
any business the trend now given that
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
you've had a business come into the
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
United States that is a brand new
 
04:19:24.600 --> 04:19:26.469 align:start position:0%
United States that is a brand new
business

04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:19:30.189 --> 04:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
unidentified as far as how how big it
 
04:19:32.229 --> 04:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
can be or how far it can go in the
 
04:19:35.229 --> 04:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
Cannabis business uh so that's certainly
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
of concern not only to New Hampshire but
 
04:19:40.149 --> 04:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
to anyone in the alcohol business right
 
04:19:43.389 --> 04:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
now uh there's a there's been a plan and
 
04:19:45.630 --> 04:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
there has been a plan and one of the
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
reasons that we we uh reacted to this is
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
first and foremost in
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
20145 when governor Patrick changed the
 
04:19:58.750 --> 04:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
license structure in Massachusetts to
 
04:20:01.510 --> 04:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
allow for years and years and years you
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
could only hold three licenses in
 
04:20:05.149 --> 04:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts when he changed the
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
license structure he went from three to
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
six to 9 and now it's up to 12 so one
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
individual in or one Corporation can
 
04:20:17.469 --> 04:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
hold more than one license thus bringing
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
Total Wine the
 
04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
largest uh beverage retailer they do uh
 
04:20:27.630 --> 04:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
tobacco they do beer they do wine they
 
04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
267 stores in 23 States and they do
 
04:20:38.469 --> 04:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
around six billion very disruptive to
 
04:20:40.830 --> 04:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
the market they've been disruptive to
 
04:20:44.109 --> 04:20:44.119 align:start position:0%
our Market but but we've countered that
 
04:20:49.229 --> 04:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
by discounting deeper and the the the
 
04:20:51.510 --> 04:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
biggest piece about it is we never
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh disappoint any of our
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
consumers so in order to keep our prices
 
04:20:59.950 --> 04:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
low and to compete with Total Wine we've
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
discounted heavier we're now coming out
 
04:21:05.229 --> 04:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
of that phase where we've kept our
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
consumers in place we're continuing to
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
Discount and you can see our ads in the
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
Boston Globe or on our website or any of
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
the social media posts we do we have
 
04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
thousands hundreds of thousands of
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
followers in the social media platforms
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
so we continue to discount if we don't
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the competition then we're
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
going to be at a disadvantage every time
 
04:21:32.349 --> 04:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
as far as selling the business I I
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
suppose at any point you can sell a
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
business if you want to uh if you if
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're to your point selling at your
 
04:21:41.710 --> 04:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
Peak I still think we're at a peak we're
 
04:21:44.590 --> 04:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
not at the peak of covid but we've we've
 
04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
dropped off some but I if we had dropped
 
04:21:50.429 --> 04:21:50.439 align:start position:0%
off some and it was exclusive to us or
 
04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
even exclusive to New England I would
 
04:21:54.429 --> 04:21:54.439 align:start position:0%
think I would be more concerned but it's
 
04:21:57.070 --> 04:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
not it's a nationwide phenomenon and
 
04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's a worldwide phenomena so I think
 
04:22:02.830 --> 04:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
that you have to ride this wave out of
 
04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
maybe not being as profitable but
 
04:22:07.710 --> 04:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
keeping your consumers in place we've
 
04:22:12.269 --> 04:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
clearly upgraded our locations 45 or so
 
04:22:15.149 --> 04:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
so so of our locations had we not done
 
04:22:17.710 --> 04:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
that prior to Total Wine coming to the
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
market we would have we would have been
 
04:22:22.830 --> 04:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
devastated because protal wine stores
 
04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
are 20,000 square feet plus they have
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
the shopping experience that we have
 
04:22:32.189 --> 04:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
they have everything that we have we
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
have we have been blessed with the Press
 
04:22:38.710 --> 04:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
worldwide and
 
04:22:41.309 --> 04:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
Nationwide that say New Hampshire Liquor
 
04:22:43.870 --> 04:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
Commission stores are the best are
 
04:22:46.389 --> 04:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
either the best or some of the best in
 
04:22:49.229 --> 04:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
the world and we're very proud of that
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
we've created a brand that people know
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
and respect and when your brand is known
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
and respected your suppliers and your
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
Brokers take notice and they want to do
 
04:23:03.790 --> 04:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
business with you that is the goal they
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
want to supply you with product at the
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
best prices there one there's very few
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
things that I can guarantee you but if
 
04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
you privatize the liquor Comm Mission
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
and you put stores in place prices in
 
04:23:17.790 --> 04:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire are going to
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
go up
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
exponentially and the 50% of the
 
04:23:25.070 --> 04:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
business that comes from cross border
 
04:23:29.070 --> 04:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
will disappear overnight I can guarantee
 
04:23:29.080 --> 04:23:34.349 align:start position:0%
will disappear overnight I can guarantee
you

04:23:34.349 --> 04:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
that sing thank you chair thanks for
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question I agree with you on
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
that because lots of my friends are
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
coming across the board order every
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
weekend to buy the liquor for the
 
04:23:48.910 --> 04:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
discount my question is uh everybody is
 
04:23:51.070 --> 04:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
basically talking about the efficiency
 
04:23:54.149 --> 04:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
the productivity and the profit margins
 
04:23:57.389 --> 04:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
are less so as compared to other states
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
who are selling the leaker where New
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stands and what's the ranking
 
04:24:05.469 --> 04:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of Revenue as well as the
 
04:24:08.070 --> 04:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
profit margin we have done any kind of
 
04:24:08.080 --> 04:24:09.109 align:start position:0%
profit margin we have done any kind of
studies

04:24:09.109 --> 04:24:09.119 align:start position:0%
studies
 
04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
or well we would sorry represent thank
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
you for the question it's it's one of
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
those things where a control State uh
 
04:24:20.990 --> 04:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
margins are different than an open State
 
04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
and we are our margins are tighter
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
because we of the states around us
 
04:24:29.229 --> 04:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania has 900 Plus stores some
 
04:24:32.710 --> 04:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
are control some are open their margins
 
04:24:34.590 --> 04:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
in some respects when I look at their
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
margins Nationwide we're we're higher in
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
margins than most of the states on the
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
Eastern SE
 
04:24:46.830 --> 04:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
board it's hard to compare given that we
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
are also the the distributor you know
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
we're the three tier we multi- tiers
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
where if other states if you're
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
privatized you're only buying it from a
 
04:24:58.349 --> 04:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
distributor you're buying from a
 
04:25:00.510 --> 04:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
distributor so your wholesale price is
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to be higher than our wholesale
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
price and so just just quickly for the
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
record our GP runs around
 
04:25:13.710 --> 04:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
29% and our net profit runs around 20
 
04:25:17.149 --> 04:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh historically thank
 
04:25:19.790 --> 04:25:19.800 align:start position:0%

from this business on May 31st of this
 
04:25:58.109 --> 04:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
year after 40 years in the
 
04:26:00.750 --> 04:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
business um it's a great business I've
 
04:26:03.630 --> 04:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
enjoyed it I've watched what exactly was
 
04:26:06.870 --> 04:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
your business beverage alcohol dur
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
martinetti companies is how it ended up
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
martinet okay and martinetti is still in
 
04:26:13.269 --> 04:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
business it's just that I retired at at
 
04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
the top of the
 
04:26:19.550 --> 04:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
company and um you know when you when
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
you look around and go back through
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
history and see what this Liquor
 
04:26:29.550 --> 04:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
Commission was 40 35 30 years
 
04:26:33.189 --> 04:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
ago uh it is incredible that it has come
 
04:26:36.030 --> 04:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
as far as it has come and to be as
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
businesslike as it can be um because it
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the beginning it was whoever
 
04:26:44.229 --> 04:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to Fork out something to somebody
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
got something I hate to say it but
 
04:26:49.309 --> 04:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
that's the way it was a long time ago um
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
it has changed and I only wanted to come
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
up here today to offer myself if you
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
have any questions about privatization I
 
04:27:02.510 --> 04:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
also engineered and ran main beverage
 
04:27:06.630 --> 04:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
company for 10 years from 2004 to
 
04:27:08.750 --> 04:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
2014 one thing you have to understand
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
about selling this business it is a
 
04:27:12.399 --> 04:27:14.550 align:start position:0%
about selling this business it is a
legal

04:27:14.550 --> 04:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
legal
 
04:27:17.710 --> 04:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
Monopoly you can't sell
 
04:27:21.070 --> 04:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
it not as a not as one piece it you
 
04:27:22.590 --> 04:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
cannot sell
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
it when Maine was looking for money back
 
04:27:28.950 --> 04:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
in 2003 and 2004 that's what they wanted
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
to do they wanted to sell the liquor
 
04:27:36.750 --> 04:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
business I had a friend who happened to
 
04:27:38.950 --> 04:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
know the lawyer in the state of Maine
 
04:27:42.510 --> 04:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
and those two people got together and
 
04:27:44.349 --> 04:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
they realized that they were going down
 
04:27:46.030 --> 04:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
a path that wasn't going to
 
04:27:49.149 --> 04:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
work in their instance they needed money
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
they weren't looking to why the liquor
 
04:27:52.990 --> 04:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
business was up or down they just wanted
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
money they they just had the hand out
 
04:27:56.590 --> 04:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
they wanted money they were in a
 
04:27:56.600 --> 04:27:58.189 align:start position:0%
they wanted money they were in a
desperate

04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
desperate
 
04:28:00.790 --> 04:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
position and we facilitated some
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
information that got them to look at
 
04:28:03.990 --> 04:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
leasing the
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
business so that's pretty much what
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
happened there were four biders one of
 
04:28:11.910 --> 04:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
them couldn't put up the money so there
 
04:28:14.830 --> 04:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
were three biders in the end and we won
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
that contract and we ran that business
 
04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
from 2004 to
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
2014 what we injected into that business
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
is what New Hampshire has had for a long
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
time now and that's a very
 
04:28:30.670 --> 04:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
high-end professional
 
04:28:33.269 --> 04:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
business we were able to bring that to
 
04:28:37.030 --> 04:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine we took that business
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
over the 10 years from about 87 million
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
to just a little bit shy of 50
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
million the state realized that let me
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
back up a little bit they were the ones
 
04:28:51.590 --> 04:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
that decided what the price would be so
 
04:28:54.189 --> 04:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the fact of you bidding high
 
04:28:56.950 --> 04:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
or low here's the price it was $125
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
million back then and what they said was
 
04:29:02.429 --> 04:29:02.439 align:start position:0%
give us a revenue share what do you what
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
do you want what do you want to propose
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
as a revenue
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
share we came in as the highest uh we
 
04:29:11.469 --> 04:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
won the bid it was challenged we won the
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
challenge we started the business on the
 
04:29:17.109 --> 04:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
weekend of uh July 4th holiday uh
 
04:29:18.630 --> 04:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
cleaning out a warehouse in Portland and
 
04:29:20.710 --> 04:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
moving up to
 
04:29:23.550 --> 04:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
Augusta that was the perfect opportunity
 
04:29:27.309 --> 04:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
for a form of privatization it needed
 
04:29:30.510 --> 04:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
help we Maine wasn't many years past
 
04:29:32.349 --> 04:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
where you walked into a front room and
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
gave somebody a number and they walked
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
out back and got your bottle of Jack
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
Daniels and brought it out to you and
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
you paid that was the way the business
 
04:29:43.590 --> 04:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
was done up there
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
clearly that is not the way New
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is and uh to um I was going to
 
04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
call him Joe I'm supposed to call him Mr
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
Mika I guess um to hit to Mr mica's
 
04:29:56.960 --> 04:30:01.109 align:start position:0%
Mika I guess um to hit to Mr mica's
Point

04:30:01.109 --> 04:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.349 --> 04:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't make sense you look at the
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
accolades you look at the money you look
 
04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
at the growth over the
 
04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
years you think of any business that you
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
know and if it a couple of years that
 
04:30:15.070 --> 04:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
are that are challenging do you just
 
04:30:18.189 --> 04:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
fold up the tan and go home no you all
 
04:30:21.070 --> 04:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
get to work you all try to figure it out
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
I want to touch on the Enterprise as
 
04:30:25.870 --> 04:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
well the Enterprise was a
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
situation that in simple terms allowed
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
them to run a
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
business I used to go around and promote
 
04:30:34.990 --> 04:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission here in New
 
04:30:37.750 --> 04:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just because I wanted to and
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
they asked me at a couple of store
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
openings and I would always say um
 
04:30:42.720 --> 04:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
openings and I would always say um
you

04:30:44.070 --> 04:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
know imagine running a business with a
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
board of directors of
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
424 people on that board because that's
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
what this represents here is a board of
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
directors with 424 directors so the
 
04:31:02.229 --> 04:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
Enterprise fund allowed them to get to
 
04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
the point where they could make those
 
04:31:08.189 --> 04:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
decisions you entrust them with a $850
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
million business you should entrust them
 
04:31:14.670 --> 04:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:17.309 --> 04:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
so that's why the Enterprise I believe
 
04:31:19.870 --> 04:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
is a is the perfect way and should
 
04:31:23.309 --> 04:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
continue to run that way
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
um as a person who has run a privatized
 
04:31:28.399 --> 04:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
um as a person who has run a privatized
control

04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
State I can tell you right now and we've
 
04:31:35.670 --> 04:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
had conversations in the past with some
 
04:31:37.990 --> 04:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
of the legislators going back eight or
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
nine years and every time anything was
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
ever discussed or looked at it was New
 
04:31:46.990 --> 04:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not need to be
 
04:31:49.149 --> 04:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
privatized you have one of the most
 
04:31:51.910 --> 04:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
professionally run organizations in the
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
country out of the 17
 
04:31:57.550 --> 04:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
States we were flying back and forth to
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
privatize it was going to be a little
 
04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
bit different there were only two
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
companies that were vying for
 
04:32:10.590 --> 04:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
it we were clearly going to be the
 
04:32:10.600 --> 04:32:12.269 align:start position:0%
it we were clearly going to be the
winner

04:32:12.269 --> 04:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
winner
 
04:32:15.030 --> 04:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
Costco got involved and forced a public
 
04:32:17.189 --> 04:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
referendum in that state and the
 
04:32:19.710 --> 04:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
referendum was the week before the
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
announcements of who won the uh ability
 
04:32:27.070 --> 04:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
to privatize and run that
 
04:32:29.510 --> 04:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
state and what happened over those
 
04:32:33.469 --> 04:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
ensuing 18 to 24 months after that
 
04:32:33.479 --> 04:32:34.990 align:start position:0%
ensuing 18 to 24 months after that
prices

04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
prices
 
04:32:37.550 --> 04:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
tripled crime
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
doubled alcohol became a a you know
 
04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
people just wanted it no matter what you
 
04:32:49.109 --> 04:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
can't replace the
 
04:32:52.389 --> 04:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
income and and figure out you know where
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to come from if you privatize
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 146 150 million
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
dollar right now annually going into
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
that general
 
04:33:04.670 --> 04:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
fund if you just wrapped it all up in a
 
04:33:06.670 --> 04:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
ball and gave it to the highest bidder
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and you got your billion

appreciate his his interest in that
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
however the state employees um you know
 
04:36:26.510 --> 04:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
I this is my 28th session I've I've seen
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
this movie
 
04:36:31.590 --> 04:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
before um certainly have and I can tell
 
04:36:33.949 --> 04:36:33.959 align:start position:0%
you that uh privatization just just
 
04:36:36.070 --> 04:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
04:36:39.230 --> 04:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's important to take a
 
04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
look at I mean from our perspective um
 
04:36:43.470 --> 04:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
selfishly state employees Association we
 
04:36:45.750 --> 04:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
want this we want the state to be as
 
04:36:47.551 --> 04:36:47.561 align:start position:0%
successful as possible when it comes to
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
revenues because that gives us and the
 
04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
state the ability to negotiate really
 
04:36:54.029 --> 04:36:54.039 align:start position:0%
good contracts for our employees those
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
who work for the state of New Hampshire
 
04:36:57.990 --> 04:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the less Revenue uh makes
 
04:37:00.429 --> 04:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
bargaining a little bit tougher so
 
04:37:03.470 --> 04:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's our main interest and so
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
you know one one state to take a look at
 
04:37:07.230 --> 04:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
is it's been referenced before is the
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
state of
 
04:37:10.990 --> 04:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
Washington um so that that was
 
04:37:13.230 --> 04:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
privatized uh back in
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
2011 and I just this afternoon um pulled
 
04:37:18.830 --> 04:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
this up this is directly from the
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
Washington State Liquor uh control board
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
uh annual report from from
 
04:37:28.230 --> 04:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
2011 and it states in 2011 their their
 
04:37:30.590 --> 04:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
total income for gross liquor sales beer
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
taxes wine taxes liquor fees was 1
 
04:37:37.949 --> 04:37:37.959 align:start position:0%
billion 6 million
 
04:37:40.429 --> 04:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
$370,000 with an operating expenses of
 
04:37:40.439 --> 04:37:42.510 align:start position:0%
$370,000 with an operating expenses of
$127

04:37:42.510 --> 04:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
$127
 
04:37:45.150 --> 04:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
million uh net roughly about
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
878 uh 600 878
 
04:37:52.390 --> 04:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
m650 fast forward um to obviously after
 
04:37:54.510 --> 04:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
this state has been privatized for the
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
last 12 years um Washington state liquor
 
04:37:59.830 --> 04:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
and cannabis board now notice they they
 
04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
threw in the Cannabis board because now
 
04:38:05.310 --> 04:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
they do cannabis um their 2024 annual
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
report for Spirit fees beer tax wine tax
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
liquor license fees comes to 265
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
million tremendous tremendous difference
 
04:38:22.429 --> 04:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
so selfishly as representing all of our
 
04:38:25.390 --> 04:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful state employees what I see is
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
we don't get we get the onetime shot of
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
that whatever the billion or whatever it
 
04:38:32.670 --> 04:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
may be was but longterm which is what
 
04:38:35.830 --> 04:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
we're all interested in um it's just
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
does not make sense from from a revenue
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
perspective you know in Washington state
 
04:38:42.789 --> 04:38:42.799 align:start position:0%
if if you if you really drill down
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see three years after they
 
04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
privatized um
 
04:38:52.670 --> 04:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
93% of of the business was owned by two
 
04:38:52.680 --> 04:38:53.869 align:start position:0%
93% of of the business was owned by two
national

04:38:53.869 --> 04:38:53.879 align:start position:0%
national
 
04:38:58.269 --> 04:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
companies okay in the first three years
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
in the first three years you had um you
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
had prices increase on a 750 ml um
 
04:39:11.709 --> 04:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
15.5% um they have the highest liquor
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
tax in the entire
 
04:39:15.551 --> 04:39:15.561 align:start position:0%
country at
 
04:39:19.869 --> 04:39:19.879 align:start position:0%
$35.31 uh per gallon for for
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
Spirits so all signs pointing to
 
04:39:26.269 --> 04:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
privatization do not look good from a
 
04:39:27.629 --> 04:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
from a revenue
 
04:39:31.269 --> 04:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
perspective um so costs do go up um
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
after Washington State privatized they
 
04:39:34.910 --> 04:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
went from
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
332 locations to to to purchase alcohol
 
04:39:43.070 --> 04:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
um that's um that's a that's a lot of
 
04:39:48.070 --> 04:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
locations which I don't have to tell you
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh the the extra additional cost that
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
that um that the state and the local
 
04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities would would have to incur
 
04:39:59.550 --> 04:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
after that um so um I would um encourage
 
04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
you to to to vote this bill down uh for
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that I've seen um for
 
04:40:05.670 --> 04:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
for many many years and just look at
 
04:40:07.470 --> 04:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
Washington State it's a great model to
 
04:40:09.150 --> 04:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
you know take a look at and get educated
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the privatization um happy to take on
 
04:40:11.520 --> 04:40:13.030 align:start position:0%
in the privatization um happy to take on
any

04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:40:15.788 --> 04:40:15.798 align:start position:0%
questions representative spear this is
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
not really a question but you had a lot
 
04:40:18.830 --> 04:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
of good information there is there any
 
04:40:21.510 --> 04:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
chance you can email that to us it's all
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
up here yeah well that won't help no I
 
04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know I I jotted down some notes um
 
04:40:30.390 --> 04:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
I I'll do the best I can of course would
 
04:40:30.400 --> 04:40:32.910 align:start position:0%
I I'll do the best I can of course would

New Hampshire residents through policy
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
change um in particular my focus is on
 
04:41:13.150 --> 04:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
substance misuse and preventing
 
04:41:16.470 --> 04:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
strategies um on uh on preventing
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
substance misuse and the unintended harm
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
so I have some resources that I'll leave
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
for you today um and then I'll just say
 
04:41:26.910 --> 04:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
a few words uh one of the things H it
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
was supposed to print out in nice colors
 
04:41:32.030 --> 04:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
but it didn't um for I'm leaving with
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
you today cdc's um chart on proven
 
04:41:37.390 --> 04:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
strategies to prevent excess alcohol use
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
and lower alcohol related harms um we
 
04:41:42.910 --> 04:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
talked about two of them today enforcing
 
04:41:44.550 --> 04:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
enforce enforcement of laws that
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit sell selling alcohol to uh
 
04:41:49.470 --> 04:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
Youth and also avoid further
 
04:41:52.030 --> 04:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
privatization of retail alcohol sales so
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
these having a privatized or com um
 
04:41:57.868 --> 04:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
control State model is really the best
 
04:41:59.948 --> 04:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
public health model as opposed to a
 
04:42:02.910 --> 04:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
privatized model so I have this to leave
 
04:42:05.948 --> 04:42:05.958 align:start position:0%
you um one other strategy is increasing
 
04:42:07.628 --> 04:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
taxes but I guess we're not doing that
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
according to that last little
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
bit um I also want to uh talk a little
 
04:42:16.628 --> 04:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
bit about I have um I do have some
 
04:42:19.750 --> 04:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
information that be helpful um from the
 
04:42:21.390 --> 04:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
national Alcohol Beverage Control
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
Association to really talk much more in
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
depth about what control control State
 
04:42:28.990 --> 04:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
models do um for me it really isn't
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
about the money I'm not lying when I say
 
04:42:32.670 --> 04:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
that it really is about public health
 
04:42:34.510 --> 04:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
it's really about protection it's really
 
04:42:34.520 --> 04:42:35.390 align:start position:0%
it's really about protection it's really
about

04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
responsible um use of alcohol and we
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
really see as as Bob touched um based on
 
04:42:44.270 --> 04:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
that public health um or control State
 
04:42:47.470 --> 04:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
models really emulate that and so where
 
04:42:50.590 --> 04:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
we see um well it's great we do see an
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
increase in Revenue in control models
 
04:42:55.110 --> 04:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm happier about is the fact that
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
we see less
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
consumption and um less premises on-site
 
04:43:02.430 --> 04:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
premises so when we talk about this
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
commission I hope that if it does go
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
forward and I'm not sure if it should
 
04:43:08.910 --> 04:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
but if it does there's a lot of other
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
aspects to uh whether a State should be
 
04:43:15.670 --> 04:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
having a control or um private model and
 
04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
those are also having a lot to do uh
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
with public health and um being kind of
 
04:43:23.230 --> 04:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
an expert on Al alcohol policy in the
 
04:43:25.550 --> 04:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
state I would like new Futures to be on
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
that commission as well as the industry
 
04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
because I think you need a balance but
 
04:43:31.550 --> 04:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time I think we've also kind
 
04:43:34.750 --> 04:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
of talked out uh reasons why um I don't
 
04:43:36.750 --> 04:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
know if a a commission is the best use
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
of time so I will leave these resources
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
for you and I'm happy to address oh and
 
04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
I had one more sorry um I'm sorry about
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
that the other thing that that uh New
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire commission the division
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement is responsible for tobacco
 
04:43:53.070 --> 04:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
sales compliance I talked about this
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
morning if the division of enforcement
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
goes away and we don't do that anymore
 
04:44:00.310 --> 04:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
we will lose some federal funding for
 
04:44:02.830 --> 04:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
substance misuse prevention um from the
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%

privatization and I know the bill isn't
 
04:45:52.510 --> 04:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
just about privatization but um why
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
would you want to take money from the
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and give it to a
 
04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
private company private companies would
 
04:46:00.110 --> 04:46:00.120 align:start position:0%

04:48:01.230 --> 04:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:03.948 --> 04:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
proponents no I'm just saying it has
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
yes I
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
but then I look down and realize you're
 
04:48:16.430 --> 04:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
not on the
 
04:48:19.470 --> 04:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
bill it's I I I would have just assume
 
04:48:21.670 --> 04:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
this would have been your bill I would
 
04:48:24.910 --> 04:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
just assume that Keith would be on
 
04:48:28.590 --> 04:48:28.600 align:start position:0%
it and you would be on
 
04:48:37.390 --> 04:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
right yeah the yeah the removing the
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
requirement of on premise beverage
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor is there any sponsor out in the
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
hall does anybody know this
 
04:49:07.920 --> 04:49:09.270 align:start position:0%
hall does anybody know this
representative

04:49:09.270 --> 04:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:20.708 --> 04:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
tell reming food
 
04:49:23.070 --> 04:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
oh we can save ourselves a lot of work
 
04:49:27.430 --> 04:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.440 --> 04:49:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
this

04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
um over the years over the years what
 
04:49:36.510 --> 04:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
you usually would do is um is that you
 
04:49:38.470 --> 04:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
we would just say tag you're it you get
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
up and introduce the bill and I always
 
04:49:42.310 --> 04:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
thought that was stupid and a waste of
 
04:49:46.868 --> 04:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
time I normally would say is okay well
 
04:49:48.910 --> 04:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who is in
 
04:49:50.990 --> 04:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
support of the
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
bill would like to
 
04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
testify at this point I only got one
 
04:49:56.080 --> 04:49:57.190 align:start position:0%
testify at this point I only got one
negative

04:49:57.190 --> 04:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
negative
 
04:50:00.150 --> 04:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
card from the usual
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
suspect so
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
so in terms of of introducing the
 
04:50:10.990 --> 04:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill I I'm I guess uh
 
04:50:13.548 --> 04:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
representative S I just ask you just to
 
04:50:15.470 --> 04:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
officially introduce it you don't have
 
04:50:18.270 --> 04:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
to say you're for it you could say
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
something about how you've been down
 
04:50:21.990 --> 04:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
this path
 
04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:30.070 --> 04:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh that's all you have to
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
say well thank you Mr chair for that
 
04:50:35.190 --> 04:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
honor of presenting this bill that's not
 
04:50:37.628 --> 04:50:37.638 align:start position:0%
mine but as many in this room know I
 
04:50:40.350 --> 04:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
would probably support because I am of
 
04:50:42.150 --> 04:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
the mindset that we should be able to
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more freedom for our
 
04:50:46.910 --> 04:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
businesses um I did try to do a similar
 
04:50:48.590 --> 04:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
version of this this goes further than
 
04:50:50.948 --> 04:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
what I preent or what I presented last
 
04:50:53.390 --> 04:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
year although last year I because you
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
were so kind to me on a different bill I
 
04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
I made a motion to um interim study my
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill which effectively killed it but
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
this bill looks like it would remove all
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
food requirements for selling alcohol so
 
04:51:08.910 --> 04:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
for those of you who don't know on the
 
04:51:10.350 --> 04:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
community there's a few new me new
 
04:51:13.708 --> 04:51:13.718 align:start position:0%
people here in order to have alcohol
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
sales or license to sell alcohol at a
 
04:51:18.590 --> 04:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant or bar actually no bars
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
because those are illegal in New
 
04:51:22.470 --> 04:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so any restaurant in New
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that wants to sell alcohol has
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
to sell food if you don't sell at least
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
$75,000 in food you have to get at least
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
50% of your Revenue has to come from
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
food once you go over 50 or $75,000 then
 
04:51:37.510 --> 04:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't the percentages go away so
 
04:51:39.670 --> 04:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
this is stripping that requirement for
 
04:51:42.670 --> 04:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
for any restaurant that sells alcohol uh
 
04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um my
 
04:51:46.000 --> 04:51:48.070 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um my
guess

04:51:48.070 --> 04:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
guess
 
04:51:50.350 --> 04:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
is there's only one person on here I'm
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
guessing maybe it's perhaps it's a new
 
04:51:53.868 --> 04:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
State Rep and maybe that's why he's not
 
04:51:55.868 --> 04:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
here he is a first Tim yeah so this is
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
probably like a new experience as it was
 
04:52:01.230 --> 04:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
for me last term um but yeah so that's
 
04:52:03.430 --> 04:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's what this build does I like the
 
04:52:05.788 --> 04:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
idea in principle and I will take
 
04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
questions since
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
I'm The
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
Unofficial expert
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe I would when I lived
 
04:52:18.670 --> 04:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
in New York I lived uh for the first 25
 
04:52:21.310 --> 04:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
years of my life between two bars cuz
 
04:52:24.708 --> 04:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
New York has bars and every
 
04:52:26.948 --> 04:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
weekend because there was no food served
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
in those bars every weekend every
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
windows were smashed all along the block
 
04:52:34.750 --> 04:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
my my little apartment the building that
 
04:52:38.990 --> 04:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
I was in was just they peed in the foyer
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
for God's sakes there's no way we should
 
04:52:43.788 --> 04:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
do anything like this would you believe
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
well I I would believe would you believe
 
04:52:49.150 --> 04:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
that when I lived in Chicago I live next
 
04:52:50.750 --> 04:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
to a bar that did not sell food and I
 
04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
saw no broken windows the entire time I
 
04:52:54.590 --> 04:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
lived there would you believe two
 
04:53:00.548 --> 04:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
bars representative wal do you have a
 
04:53:06.990 --> 04:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question on something
 
04:53:13.150 --> 04:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
that isn't your bill but just pondering
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh the possibilities of this bill could
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
it be possible to allow this at bars but
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
allow people to perhaps bring food bring
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
their own food to alleviate that problem
 
04:53:30.670 --> 04:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
of broken windows as in New York I think
 
04:53:32.590 --> 04:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
that that's a interesting thing that we
 
04:53:35.548 --> 04:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
should explore particularly if the the
 
04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
actual sponsor comes back to maybe our
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
working committee or something we could
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
talk to him about it cuz I actually
 
04:53:42.190 --> 04:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
think that's a pretty good
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
idea you know full disclosure we talked
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit earlier and I
 
04:53:46.910 --> 04:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
was in South
 
04:53:49.390 --> 04:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
Dakota uh a couple summers ago visiting
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
one of my best friends who lives there
 
04:53:53.670 --> 04:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
and we went to a place that only served
 
04:53:55.150 --> 04:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
beer and and they didn't have food and
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
we were able to bring our own food so it
 
04:53:58.230 --> 04:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
was actually a good way to kind of
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:05.150 --> 04:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
food um I think the next person who will
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
testify will help clarify that issue for
 
04:54:12.670 --> 04:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair oh we have more okay does
 
04:54:18.310 --> 04:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:20.590 --> 04:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
clubs well I'm not an expert on this
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
bill but I don't think so because I
 
04:54:23.948 --> 04:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
believe it's just going after
 
04:54:26.910 --> 04:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants from the way I read it and
 
04:54:29.310 --> 04:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
there are different things in here that
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
talk about hotel full service and
 
04:54:33.670 --> 04:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
different areas but the all the strike
 
04:54:35.948 --> 04:54:35.958 align:start position:0%
out language looks like it's only going
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
to be going after restaurants that
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
currently are required by these things I
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
think clubs have different rules and
 
04:54:42.350 --> 04:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
regulations so I don't think it would
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
affect them but again I've had this bill
 
04:54:46.670 --> 04:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
as long as all of you so I don't know if
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
I know I would say they have a different
 
04:54:50.110 --> 04:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
license they have a different license
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
they have a different kind of license so
 
04:54:53.350 --> 04:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
no it would not affect them anyways
 
04:54:55.548 --> 04:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
right because I mean vfw's they
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
occasionally have food right and they
 
04:55:02.548 --> 04:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
even smoke in there too uh maybe they do
 
04:55:04.750 --> 04:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
but uh East Side Club the Manchester has
 
04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
a bunch of private clubs and they are
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
active yeah it's on my bill I don't know
 
04:55:11.628 --> 04:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
if if his intention was to go after
 
04:55:14.110 --> 04:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
those but I doubt it would in back them
 
04:55:15.868 --> 04:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
from how I read it no they would not
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
affect them because it's a different
 
04:55:19.590 --> 04:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
license they're not on on on premise
 
04:55:21.708 --> 04:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
license representative
 
04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
04:55:27.150 --> 04:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
you representative Sullivan for taking
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
on something that you uh had no notice
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
of um but in regard to bringing your own
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
food into a bar um would you believe
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
that in Massachusetts there are
 
04:55:42.830 --> 04:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
establishments or at least have been
 
04:55:45.628 --> 04:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
establishments that sold beer wine and
 
04:55:49.030 --> 04:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
liquor and food up to a certain hour and
 
04:55:52.110 --> 04:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
then after a certain hour um and the one
 
04:55:56.430 --> 04:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
I'm spec specifically remembering um it
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
was 8:30 p.m. they shut down the Food
 
04:55:58.920 --> 04:55:59.990 align:start position:0%
was 8:30 p.m. they shut down the Food
Service

04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
Service
 
04:56:03.628 --> 04:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
completely um and sold only beer wine
 
04:56:07.150 --> 04:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
and liquor and at that point I tried to
 
04:56:09.948 --> 04:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
bring a sandwich in so that I could eat
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
it with my glass of wine and I was told
 
04:56:16.030 --> 04:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
that I couldn't eat my own sandwich in
 
04:56:18.190 --> 04:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
in their establishment
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
because uh Health regulations prohibited
 
04:56:25.470 --> 04:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
it I I would believe that that's
 
04:56:26.948 --> 04:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we don't want to mess
 
04:56:31.070 --> 04:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
up M so we will do a better we will do a
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
better bill that would not do that give
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
us more freedom so so just so you know
 
04:56:38.910 --> 04:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
just so you understand that in New
 
04:56:41.310 --> 04:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is true we don't have a bar
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything that licens a bar
 
04:56:48.430 --> 04:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
however uh a establishment that is a on
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
premise license C is permitted to have a
 
04:56:51.840 --> 04:56:53.670 align:start position:0%
premise license C is permitted to have a
cocktail

04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
cocktail
 
04:56:56.830 --> 04:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
lounge and that cocktail lounge after
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's 9:00 right yeah it's 9 o' is the is
 
04:57:03.510 --> 04:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
our our Midnight Hour or I should say
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
our our beginning hour our Cinderella
 
04:57:09.868 --> 04:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
hour begins and at 9:00 that restaurant
 
04:57:13.110 --> 04:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
does not need to serve food anymore it
 
04:57:16.390 --> 04:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
can serve you just
 
04:57:19.070 --> 04:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol the interesting thing is that is
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
a higher liquor license and
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
Applebees because evidently according to
 
04:57:28.830 --> 04:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
the former Chief told me is you ever go
 
04:57:30.548 --> 04:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
in the kitchen it's just walls and walls
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
of microwaves where they they Grill the
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
you grill your steak but everything else
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
is microwaved uh they keep the kitchen
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
open the whole time so they actually get
 
04:57:44.350 --> 04:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
a cheaper liquor license simply because
 
04:57:47.628 --> 04:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
they don't close the establishment I ask
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question yes um and I guess
 
04:57:52.150 --> 04:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
I'm actually asking this of you Mr
 
04:57:55.110 --> 04:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
chairman since you brought it up um the
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
cocktail lounge um is the cocktail
 
04:58:01.110 --> 04:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
lounge allowed to allow the customer to
 
04:58:03.548 --> 04:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
bring food into the cocktail lounge
 
04:58:05.430 --> 04:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
after 900 p.m. there is no law they
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
would say they can't but in terms of
 
04:58:09.628 --> 04:58:09.638 align:start position:0%
maybe the health code of their Town
 
04:58:12.350 --> 04:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
might have an issue with it but um I
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
have noticed that some establishments
 
04:58:15.990 --> 04:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
have a sign that says you can't bring
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
your own food you when you come in here
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
the you know and I I assume they didn't
 
04:58:23.230 --> 04:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
want somebody to stop at McDonald's and
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
then and then come in and eat and drink
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
at the same time but um again that would
 
04:58:31.510 --> 04:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
be up to the actual establishment to say
 
04:58:33.390 --> 04:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
you can't bring your own food because we
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
have always talked about with the Nanos
 
04:58:38.670 --> 04:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
and the uh beverage manufacturers was
 
04:58:41.470 --> 04:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
that yeah we we were urging people
 
04:58:44.190 --> 04:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
actually it was the cigar bars we talked
 
04:58:46.110 --> 04:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
about how the cigar bars is that people
 
04:58:48.150 --> 04:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
should order pizza and have the pizza
 
04:58:50.470 --> 04:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
delivered and uh and that was a
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
permitted use in under our statue and I
 
04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
would say in the in the bar where I saw
 
04:58:59.110 --> 04:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
no broken windows where I lived in
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
Chicago you people ordered pizza all the
 
04:59:04.270 --> 04:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
time like you they would actually come
 
04:59:07.030 --> 04:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
by take orders and then come back half
 
04:59:08.548 --> 04:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
hour later or you just call in the app
 
04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
or have door Dash deliver food so it was
 
04:59:13.270 --> 04:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
quite common there so uh it's certainly
 
04:59:14.670 --> 04:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
not an unprecedented thing in this
 
04:59:18.190 --> 04:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:20.910 --> 04:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
model I have a question representative
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
spear that's another
 
04:59:27.548 --> 04:59:27.558 align:start position:0%
question so no broken windows now in
 
04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
Chicago uh I'm assuming they have public
 
04:59:32.350 --> 04:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
transportation so if you do get
 
04:59:34.590 --> 04:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
snockered you get on a bus or you get on
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
a Subway in New Hampshire we have very
 
04:59:39.390 --> 04:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
little public transportation so do we
 
04:59:43.430 --> 04:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
know that if we have bars and who knows
 
04:59:45.910 --> 04:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
how many we're going to have how many
 
04:59:48.430 --> 04:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
more DUIs are we going to
 
04:59:50.948 --> 04:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
have I mean I obviously don't know that
 
04:59:54.430 --> 04:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
but um would you believe we would have
 
04:59:56.110 --> 04:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
more I wouldn't know but I would I would
 
04:59:58.830 --> 04:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
imagine just like in Chicago or Boston
 
05:00:02.190 --> 05:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
or New York um at least in the larger
 
05:00:04.990 --> 05:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
cities of New Hampshire there's a lot of
 
05:00:08.310 --> 05:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
uber even in places like like um North
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
Conway and stuff you can get is second
 
05:00:12.030 --> 05:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
largest city in the state and we have
 
05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
next to no public transportation no no
 
05:00:16.470 --> 05:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
I'm saying Ubers Ubers so like I mean
 
05:00:20.590 --> 05:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
tax you got a taxi comp tax tax have you
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
been in that
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:29.948 --> 05:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
taxis you all done with
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
me does anybody have more important
 
05:00:35.830 --> 05:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions good I would say that uh uh
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
when I was in prep school and I did get
 
05:00:41.788 --> 05:00:41.798 align:start position:0%
to drink but I turned 18 and which I was
 
05:00:45.548 --> 05:00:45.558 align:start position:0%
still in I was in in still in school but
 
05:00:47.948 --> 05:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
the school rule was that the only place
 
05:00:49.990 --> 05:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
we were allowed to drink was down at the
 
05:00:52.190 --> 05:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
Deerfield Inn because that was right on
 
05:00:56.750 --> 05:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
campus uh but that's fine but we we we
 
05:00:58.350 --> 05:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
definitely didn't want to necessarily
 
05:01:01.310 --> 05:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
drink there and we would go into
 
05:01:04.390 --> 05:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
Greenfield Massachusetts and yes we went
 
05:01:06.270 --> 05:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
to find that hole in the
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
wall beer you know know the terms of the
 
05:01:12.190 --> 05:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
cocktail Lounge whatever and they there
 
05:01:14.350 --> 05:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
was only it was maybe it was an 8 oz cup
 
05:01:18.990 --> 05:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
but it was 50 cents a beer and and and
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
we also thought we knew there'd be no
 
05:01:24.350 --> 05:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
teacher would walk in into that bar so
 
05:01:26.590 --> 05:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we are very felt sa that we
 
05:01:28.030 --> 05:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
can have all the beer we want and we
 
05:01:30.628 --> 05:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
were drinking legally but but not terms
 
05:01:33.628 --> 05:01:33.638 align:start position:0%
of the school rules okay uhair I have a
 
05:01:36.670 --> 05:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
would you believe okay thank you Mr
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh I have a would you believe
 
05:01:41.070 --> 05:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
there are bars in the state of New
 
05:01:45.150 --> 05:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they are licensed to clubs
 
05:01:48.628 --> 05:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
like the VFW the American Legion and the
 
05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
DAV they do not require food that's
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
correct they have a separate liquor
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
license yes they we will learn a little
 
05:01:57.270 --> 05:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
bit about that we have another bill
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
coming up about uh allowing uh getting
 
05:02:04.190 --> 05:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
licensers for U barber shops beauticians
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know how far it goes but this is
 
05:02:09.510 --> 05:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
would be a new license category for us
 
05:02:11.830 --> 05:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
and have that conversations about how we
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
have such a long list of licensed
 
05:02:16.910 --> 05:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
categories but uh one thing I can say
 
05:02:18.750 --> 05:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
about these licensed categories is each
 
05:02:20.628 --> 05:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
one of them has a little particular
 
05:02:23.548 --> 05:02:23.558 align:start position:0%
rules to go with it so if you were a
 
05:02:26.830 --> 05:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
tennis club you had to have two tennis
 
05:02:30.868 --> 05:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
courts if you're pool tables you have to
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.270 --> 05:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
tables 12 working that's the key word
 
05:02:40.548 --> 05:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
the quarters so we all so we do have a
 
05:02:47.310 --> 05:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
lot of other typ establishments um that
 
05:02:50.190 --> 05:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
are are exempt from the food requirement
 
05:02:53.070 --> 05:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
but they again are a unique
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
characteristic and um so we get to learn
 
05:02:57.788 --> 05:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
about that this session which we have
 
05:03:02.510 --> 05:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
not done in the last two years okay
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
um gief do you want to weigh in on this
 
05:03:06.160 --> 05:03:11.750 align:start position:0%
um gief do you want to weigh in on this
one

05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:16.628 --> 05:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
it we like tag teaming things again for
 
05:03:19.798 --> 05:03:20.510 align:start position:0%
it we like tag teaming things again for
the

05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:23.390 --> 05:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
record uh Chief Mark armaganian liquor
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement licensing uh with me here
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
today deputy chief Danielle Elston of
 
05:03:31.150 --> 05:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
the same entity
 
05:03:34.470 --> 05:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
um one thing that we've spoke about over
 
05:03:38.350 --> 05:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
the years and and in my time uh kind of
 
05:03:41.270 --> 05:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
funny how the previous Bill talked about
 
05:03:42.990 --> 05:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and that's an
 
05:03:46.150 --> 05:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
entity that I was part of for 28 years
 
05:03:48.830 --> 05:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
um we always talk about burnoff rate of
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol when we talk about highway
 
05:03:54.270 --> 05:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
safety and Community safety and and when
 
05:03:56.190 --> 05:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
we do that we talk about the consumption
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
of food and in that consumption of food
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
you're you're creating an absorption
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
rate that difference differs when with
 
05:04:06.470 --> 05:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
every one of us because of the
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
difference in metabolism rate or how we
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
metabolize alcohol um the average let's
 
05:04:15.948 --> 05:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
call it an average rate of burnoff with
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol is 015 an hour so with with food
 
05:04:22.750 --> 05:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
ingested in the system during the
 
05:04:24.990 --> 05:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
consumption of alcohol or I'm sorry
 
05:04:27.150 --> 05:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
consumption of yes consumption of
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol with food in the system that
 
05:04:32.670 --> 05:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
food absorption rate into the blood is
 
05:04:36.430 --> 05:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
slower it's kind of I I refer to it as a
 
05:04:40.110 --> 05:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
coffee filter um when you remove that
 
05:04:43.150 --> 05:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
piece from it you create a very high
 
05:04:46.150 --> 05:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
absorption rate of alcohol uh we look at
 
05:04:49.548 --> 05:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
rate of service now and and we get into
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
the negative effects that this could
 
05:04:53.230 --> 05:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
create and the negative incidents that
 
05:04:56.070 --> 05:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
this could create not only in a licensed
 
05:04:58.590 --> 05:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
establishment um but out in the highways
 
05:05:01.510 --> 05:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
out in your communities um we look at
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
this as a safety issue um uh Al alcohol
 
05:05:08.708 --> 05:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
consumption and food consumption have
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
gone hand inand for quite a few years it
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
isn't it might be a old idea uh and an
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
old premise but at the same time it is
 
05:05:24.548 --> 05:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
one that is very current um nothing has
 
05:05:28.030 --> 05:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
changed uh in science to prove
 
05:05:30.670 --> 05:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
elsewise um it is taught today in our
 
05:05:32.590 --> 05:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
Academy and through our health centers
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so with that in
 
05:05:37.628 --> 05:05:37.638 align:start position:0%
mind I I'd like to give the floor to
 
05:05:39.310 --> 05:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
Danielle to talk about the technical
 
05:05:42.990 --> 05:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
piece of this thank you I'll keep it
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
brief um as some of you know from
 
05:05:47.948 --> 05:05:47.958 align:start position:0%
previous testimony in Prior years but
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the new representatives in the room
 
05:05:53.230 --> 05:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
um title 13 is um very interwoven in
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
terms of Def definitions license
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
requirements administrative rules some
 
05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the technical flaws with this bill as
 
05:06:01.470 --> 05:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
is is it doesn't address um other
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
licensed types that also have food
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
requirements as well as definitions that
 
05:06:08.948 --> 05:06:08.958 align:start position:0%
require the leny to have certain um
 
05:06:10.830 --> 05:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
certain item involved to support the
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
food requirement so there's a lot that
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
would need to be addressed if food were
 
05:06:18.030 --> 05:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
to be eliminated in terms of definitions
 
05:06:19.750 --> 05:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
definitions types license types those
 
05:06:21.868 --> 05:06:21.878 align:start position:0%
license requirements one for example is
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
this just eliminates it with restaurants
 
05:06:25.430 --> 05:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers however if they have a
 
05:06:27.548 --> 05:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
tasting room or certain uh on- premise
 
05:06:29.070 --> 05:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
requirements are also required to have
 
05:06:30.868 --> 05:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
food so this would say that restaurants
 
05:06:33.070 --> 05:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
can't have food but the manufacturers
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
have to keep a food requirement so
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
there's um it's not just as easy as
 
05:06:40.230 --> 05:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
striking out um verbiage in one one
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
statute you have to look at it through
 
05:06:43.150 --> 05:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
the definitions through the license
 
05:06:44.310 --> 05:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
requirements and then also through the
 
05:06:44.320 --> 05:06:47.030 align:start position:0%
requirements and then also through the
administrative

05:06:47.030 --> 05:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:49.788 --> 05:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
rules in other words it's a whole new
 
05:06:52.510 --> 05:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
small Snowball Effect uh cuz let alone
 
05:06:54.830 --> 05:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
what do we have to do with off premise
 
05:06:57.910 --> 05:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
requirements okay thank you we have one
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
card left and I won't bother looking for
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
Kate right you put
 
05:07:12.548 --> 05:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
you okay you did sign in so but that
 
05:07:14.190 --> 05:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
that's good that's all you need to do
 
05:07:18.030 --> 05:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
but we knew you'd be opposed to the bill
 
05:07:21.548 --> 05:07:21.558 align:start position:0%
anyways okay Mike you get the last
 
05:07:26.990 --> 05:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:29.590 --> 05:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
y thank you Mr chairman uh members of
 
05:07:30.868 --> 05:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
Mike Summers I'm the president CEO of
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
05:07:35.470 --> 05:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
Association nice to be with you all
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
again uh we have serious concerns with
 
05:07:41.230 --> 05:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
this bill um I've testified on similar
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
initiatives I can't tell you how many
 
05:07:45.670 --> 05:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
times in my 16 years but I will say that
 
05:07:47.788 --> 05:07:47.798 align:start position:0%
uh there's a couple things but first and
 
05:07:50.270 --> 05:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
foremost Our concern is that uh to the
 
05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
Chairman's point we do not have bars in
 
05:07:53.310 --> 05:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have restaurants and
 
05:07:54.910 --> 05:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
they have very fine establishments all
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
of them um I will also say that um the
 
05:08:01.470 --> 05:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
with Cocktail Lounges sure still
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
restaurants though let's be clear still
 
05:08:06.110 --> 05:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants very fine establishments um
 
05:08:07.470 --> 05:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
but I would also like to say that you
 
05:08:09.948 --> 05:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
know the the obvious concern from the
 
05:08:11.470 --> 05:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
existing restaurant ters in the state of
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that they have already
 
05:08:16.430 --> 05:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
been required by Statute to invest in
 
05:08:17.788 --> 05:08:17.798 align:start position:0%
all of the infrastructure that is
 
05:08:19.470 --> 05:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
required to meet the food requirements
 
05:08:21.708 --> 05:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
so they have bought uh you know hundreds
 
05:08:23.350 --> 05:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
of thousands worth of kitchen equipment
 
05:08:26.190 --> 05:08:26.200 align:start position:0%
and Hood systems and train staff and
 
05:08:29.830 --> 05:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
refrigeration and freezers etc etc so uh
 
05:08:31.470 --> 05:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
it would seem a little unfair to the
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
existing lenses who have gone through
 
05:08:35.230 --> 05:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
all of this rig moral in order to meet
 
05:08:36.910 --> 05:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
the current standards to then
 
05:08:38.590 --> 05:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
essentially rip the rug out from under
 
05:08:40.670 --> 05:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
them uh because now you could have bars
 
05:08:42.310 --> 05:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
essentially on every corner with little
 
05:08:44.430 --> 05:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
to no infrastructure requirement other
 
05:08:47.548 --> 05:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
than some Refrigeration for cold beer so
 
05:08:49.310 --> 05:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh that's obviously our biggest concern
 
05:08:51.310 --> 05:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
and continues to be but I would also
 
05:08:52.830 --> 05:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
Echo what the chief said you know we do
 
05:08:54.750 --> 05:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
have a concern around safety to make
 
05:08:57.990 --> 05:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
sure that you know uh we would want that
 
05:09:00.030 --> 05:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh folks would be consuming food with
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol so that again uh mitigates that
 
05:09:05.310 --> 05:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
real issue that can arise the one
 
05:09:07.628 --> 05:09:07.638 align:start position:0%
question about Boo food we don't like
 
05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
that either just be on the record
 
05:09:11.548 --> 05:09:11.558 align:start position:0%
um we do not like that for a couple of
 
05:09:14.350 --> 05:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
reasons one is that uh from the
 
05:09:16.270 --> 05:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
standpoint of food licensing the real
 
05:09:17.788 --> 05:09:17.798 align:start position:0%
issue for a lot of these businesses is
 
05:09:19.110 --> 05:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
if somebody gets sick in their
 
05:09:21.110 --> 05:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
establishment you own it whether they
 
05:09:22.430 --> 05:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
brought the sandwich or not you're still
 
05:09:24.628 --> 05:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
going to own that issue so um that's
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a problem from a liability
 
05:09:28.430 --> 05:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint for us and more importantly I
 
05:09:30.030 --> 05:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
think for the businesses is frankly we
 
05:09:31.708 --> 05:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
would have lost a sandwich sale so I
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
think we would be more inclined to want
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
to sell you some food which is why most
 
05:09:36.750 --> 05:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
businesses post please you can't bring
 
05:09:39.390 --> 05:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
your own food in um on rare instances we
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
let you bring a birthday cake but we
 
05:09:43.548 --> 05:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
draw the line at that so with that um I
 
05:09:45.070 --> 05:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
would be happy to try to answer any
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
questions you may
 
05:09:49.990 --> 05:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
have okay represented
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
Salin so one of the things you said is
 
05:09:54.830 --> 05:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
that it's unfair because you have all
 
05:09:56.190 --> 05:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
this infrastructure that's been invested
 
05:09:58.590 --> 05:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
in by different companies right but
 
05:10:00.788 --> 05:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
presumably they've only invested because
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
that's what the current Law requires
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
them to do but if it's in their best
 
05:10:07.628 --> 05:10:07.638 align:start position:0%
interest not to do
 
05:10:09.868 --> 05:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
it then
 
05:10:11.470 --> 05:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
they could always switch out and get rid
 
05:10:12.788 --> 05:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
of that stuff they could sell that stuff
 
05:10:14.070 --> 05:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
if that's actually a more profitable
 
05:10:16.190 --> 05:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
business model that they prefer to keep
 
05:10:18.750 --> 05:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
if having a business that sells food
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
included or which is you know with all
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
this infrastructure that they need is
 
05:10:24.670 --> 05:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
actually profitable and something they
 
05:10:25.708 --> 05:10:25.718 align:start position:0%
want to continue to doing there's
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
nothing changing that so um like your
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
argument that it's unfair I'm a little
 
05:10:32.548 --> 05:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
confused by
 
05:10:35.670 --> 05:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
because they have the same rules it's
 
05:10:37.590 --> 05:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
just that they came in and invested and
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
it is either is a profitable part of
 
05:10:40.910 --> 05:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
their business or it isn't a profitable
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
part of their business and if this law
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
changed and say the the infrastructure
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
associated with that was actually losing
 
05:10:50.830 --> 05:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
money for them but they were making
 
05:10:52.470 --> 05:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
enough on alcohol sales they could just
 
05:10:54.670 --> 05:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
can it all and still remain in business
 
05:10:56.750 --> 05:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if the the fairness
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me because it seems to me
 
05:11:00.310 --> 05:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
you make a business decision based on
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
the the rules the regulations if they
 
05:11:03.628 --> 05:11:03.638 align:start position:0%
change you might pivot you might change
 
05:11:04.868 --> 05:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
you might be happy about that change you
 
05:11:06.910 --> 05:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
might be unhappy about that change but
 
05:11:09.868 --> 05:11:09.878 align:start position:0%
um you know it seems to me I don't know
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
if that makes a lot of sense so let me
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
clarify unequivocally the food is not
 
05:11:16.948 --> 05:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
profitable so the minute that you change
 
05:11:19.190 --> 05:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
this requirement that business who now
 
05:11:20.670 --> 05:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
has invested in not because you're not
 
05:11:22.150 --> 05:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
talking about just equipment and staff
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking about entire remodel of
 
05:11:25.948 --> 05:11:25.958 align:start position:0%
of an establishment right so you have an
 
05:11:28.030 --> 05:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
entire corner of the building that is
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
square footage that's been given over to
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
a kitchen so you would have to remodel
 
05:11:32.910 --> 05:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
that entire space if you wanted to
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
convert to a bar scenario but the real
 
05:11:37.470 --> 05:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
challenge is if you didn't want to make
 
05:11:38.548 --> 05:11:38.558 align:start position:0%
make that investment and now you're
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
operating as a restaurant and a place
 
05:11:41.910 --> 05:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
opens up next door that doesn't have the
 
05:11:43.390 --> 05:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
same rules right they don't have to have
 
05:11:45.788 --> 05:11:45.798 align:start position:0%
a food requirement and they can now sell
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
their drinks for a buck cheaper per
 
05:11:50.750 --> 05:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
drink all of their you know happy hour
 
05:11:52.270 --> 05:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
customers Etc are just going to go next
 
05:11:53.948 --> 05:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
door so now this business is no longer
 
05:11:55.868 --> 05:11:55.878 align:start position:0%
profitable and ultimately more than
 
05:11:57.750 --> 05:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
likely is going to fail and to your
 
05:12:00.190 --> 05:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
point about making a switch you know
 
05:12:02.030 --> 05:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's easy to kind of make a
 
05:12:03.190 --> 05:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
Cavalier statement that they can just
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
switch their business model but
 
05:12:06.230 --> 05:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
switching a business model at that level
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
is EXT extremely expensive and not
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
counting the numbers staff you would
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
probably ultimately end up laying off
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
and all the other bits and pieces of it
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
but you know we're talking about you
 
05:12:15.548 --> 05:12:15.558 align:start position:0%
have to have a walk-in cooler you got to
 
05:12:17.510 --> 05:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
have a walk-in freezer and all the hvc
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
support stuff that goes with that you
 
05:12:20.990 --> 05:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
have to have an Anil Hood system uh
 
05:12:22.990 --> 05:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
you've got friers and grills and and all
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of equipment so you're talking
 
05:12:27.070 --> 05:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
literally hundreds of thousands um
 
05:12:28.590 --> 05:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
probably half a million dollars in most
 
05:12:30.750 --> 05:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants is just equipment in the
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
kitchen followup question right but his
 
05:12:35.430 --> 05:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
point just make you sure you can't sell
 
05:12:37.868 --> 05:12:37.878 align:start position:0%
a walk-in refrigerator well you can you
 
05:12:39.548 --> 05:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
you won't sell it for a loss I mean I me
 
05:12:41.270 --> 05:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
you won't sell for for a profit you can
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
sell you can s now you're economically
 
05:12:46.990 --> 05:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
totally disadvantaged to that guy who
 
05:12:49.510 --> 05:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
get I get the argument but you're saying
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
unequivocally selling food is never
 
05:12:55.948 --> 05:12:55.958 align:start position:0%
makes money yes and I will put this out
 
05:12:58.230 --> 05:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
as an example how many boo restaurants
 
05:13:01.230 --> 05:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:04.190 --> 05:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
today there's few and they don't last
 
05:13:06.430 --> 05:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
very long and usually it's because yes
 
05:13:07.948 --> 05:13:07.958 align:start position:0%
they're selling food and you're they're
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
bringing their bottle of whatever might
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
but usually that is correct right
 
05:13:14.548 --> 05:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
because they're they're just trying to
 
05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
get open so they have some cash flow to
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
survive and you have to understand our
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
business is cash flow if you're not
 
05:13:20.590 --> 05:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
selling things you're not doing you're
 
05:13:22.910 --> 05:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
not going anywhere so U but the the real
 
05:13:24.190 --> 05:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
issue you telling me if they didn't sell
 
05:13:27.150 --> 05:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
alcohol in this state then we wouldn't
 
05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
have restaurants that's kind of the
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
argument you just made I mean there
 
05:13:31.310 --> 05:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of restaurants that
 
05:13:34.030 --> 05:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
don't sell sells for most of these
 
05:13:36.390 --> 05:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
businesses that are in that space where
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
they are selling alcohol the business
 
05:13:40.270 --> 05:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
model is bu on the on the understanding
 
05:13:41.948 --> 05:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
that alcohol is the is the is the
 
05:13:44.510 --> 05:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
profitable piece of their business so
 
05:13:45.910 --> 05:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that we should
 
05:13:47.628 --> 05:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
just never change anything because
 
05:13:50.310 --> 05:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's made Investments based on
 
05:13:52.350 --> 05:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
arguably somebody here thinks this is an
 
05:13:54.628 --> 05:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
inferior model that we currently have
 
05:13:56.470 --> 05:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
but that whether that is or isn't is a
 
05:13:58.350 --> 05:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
different argument but if I'm just
 
05:14:00.430 --> 05:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
sharing with you that on behalf of the
 
05:14:02.430 --> 05:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
businesses that I represent their
 
05:14:04.470 --> 05:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
concern is that they have been required
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
by state law in order to have their
 
05:14:07.708 --> 05:14:07.718 align:start position:0%
business that they were required to
 
05:14:09.910 --> 05:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
invest call it a a million dollars for
 
05:14:12.310 --> 05:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
argument sake just as a round number so
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
by requiring them to do that you are
 
05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
then now going to basically steal 30 40
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
50% of their profitability in their
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
business and give it to somebody else
 
05:14:22.390 --> 05:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
who's got almost no threshold to get
 
05:14:24.350 --> 05:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
into the business does that make sense
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
no no I I get the argument I'm not sure
 
05:14:29.510 --> 05:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually could you just hope give me a
 
05:14:32.110 --> 05:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
I'll give you another example of it and
 
05:14:34.510 --> 05:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
I was in think I understand it I was in
 
05:14:34.520 --> 05:14:35.708 align:start position:0%
I was in think I understand it I was in
in

05:14:35.708 --> 05:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:14:38.350 --> 05:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
Montana and uh where I lived for seven
 
05:14:38.360 --> 05:14:39.788 align:start position:0%
Montana and uh where I lived for seven
years

05:14:39.788 --> 05:14:39.798 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:14:43.150 --> 05:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
and I good then you'll know this story
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
firsthand so we went into the Mexican
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant and so I ordered a margarita
 
05:14:53.230 --> 05:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
and she said um we well we can give you
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
a margarita but it doesn't have tequila
 
05:14:58.510 --> 05:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
it's a a wine
 
05:15:01.830 --> 05:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
based I go how do you how do you do a
 
05:15:05.350 --> 05:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
margarita and a wine said well we put l
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
juice in the ger and I said so
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
so what was the story and what you why
 
05:15:14.430 --> 05:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
you know why don't you have a regular
 
05:15:16.548 --> 05:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
liquor license she said well it would
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
cost us
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
$250,000 and and I said oh you're one of
 
05:15:26.030 --> 05:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
those Medallion States right and so
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
therefore the reason why Montana has
 
05:15:32.510 --> 05:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
never changed their law is because
 
05:15:34.948 --> 05:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
everyone of those people who spent the
 
05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
$250,000 300,000 who knows what it is
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
now for that liquor license for that
 
05:15:42.990 --> 05:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
full liquor license they will run down
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
to where's the state capital Helena and
 
05:15:50.390 --> 05:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
say hell no do not change the law and
 
05:15:53.788 --> 05:15:53.798 align:start position:0%
start saying anybody can get a that
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
liquor license so yes this is a problem
 
05:16:00.830 --> 05:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
when states make laws that there is a
 
05:16:03.350 --> 05:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
consequence going forward and I've
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
always said and liquor is a classic
 
05:16:07.948 --> 05:16:07.958 align:start position:0%
example that you set the Press when you
 
05:16:10.350 --> 05:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
eat pass something
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
you're setting the prent right this is
 
05:16:14.670 --> 05:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
our version of The Medallion you get
 
05:16:17.708 --> 05:16:17.718 align:start position:0%
people who now have an invested effort
 
05:16:21.230 --> 05:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
to keep that law that you just passed so
 
05:16:23.390 --> 05:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
you better do a good job of that law
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
when you passed it the first time which
 
05:16:26.750 --> 05:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
just you know which is why I argue for a
 
05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
lot of different bills over the years to
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
be changed or structured in certain ways
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
but on the on the Montana example and
 
05:16:36.708 --> 05:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
kind of counter to his point
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
about food food not being profitable in
 
05:16:42.590 --> 05:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
Montana there's a lot of as you know as
 
05:16:44.190 --> 05:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
you clearly understand it's a medallion
 
05:16:48.390 --> 05:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
State a lot of those bars sell food too
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
but then there are ones that don't so
 
05:16:51.868 --> 05:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking in New Hampshire we
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
could have a situation where both could
 
05:16:56.830 --> 05:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
exist is just my point and and I was
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
actually going to get to the point of
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
Montana where I lived where both exist
 
05:17:03.270 --> 05:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
and but yes they do have Medallion if
 
05:17:04.548 --> 05:17:04.558 align:start position:0%
you just take right here in conquer
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
Tuckers does a great job serving
 
05:17:09.470 --> 05:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch but they don't have
 
05:17:12.548 --> 05:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
a liquor license they're not open for
 
05:17:15.788 --> 05:17:15.798 align:start position:0%
dinner representative spear we heard a
 
05:17:17.270 --> 05:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
lot in the last couple of days
 
05:17:19.070 --> 05:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
especially from The Liquor Commission
 
05:17:21.868 --> 05:17:21.878 align:start position:0%
today and last week about a big part of
 
05:17:24.310 --> 05:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
their job is the safety and I can't
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
ignore that I mean coming from areas
 
05:17:29.868 --> 05:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
where DUIs were horrendous coming from
 
05:17:32.548 --> 05:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
areas where people peed in the Foy of my
 
05:17:32.558 --> 05:17:33.910 align:start position:0%
areas where people peed in the Foy of my
apartment

05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
building we cannot ignore the fact that
 
05:17:40.750 --> 05:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
this is not just a financial
 
05:17:42.788 --> 05:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
a financial decision that it's an
 
05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
environment and so I I loved what the
 
05:17:48.350 --> 05:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission does and I like the
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
idea that people need to have a little
 
05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
bit of food you don't have to order a
 
05:17:53.830 --> 05:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
ton of food you can just have something
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
because you got to slow that stuff down
 
05:17:57.548 --> 05:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to have all kinds
 
05:17:59.310 --> 05:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
of problems that we're not considering
 
05:18:01.510 --> 05:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the process of looking at this bill
 
05:18:04.830 --> 05:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe okay
 
05:18:07.708 --> 05:18:07.718 align:start position:0%
all right you don't have to respond to
 
05:18:09.350 --> 05:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
no but if I could just couple of points
 
05:18:10.548 --> 05:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to make from the
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
discussion that's happening so you know
 
05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
if if if my comment about the alcohol is
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
not the most profitable part then how is
 
05:18:19.628 --> 05:18:19.638 align:start position:0%
it that the most punitive part of your
 
05:18:22.708 --> 05:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
statutes are suspensions of license
 
05:18:24.030 --> 05:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
because that frankly is the biggest
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
thing that hurts
 
05:18:29.110 --> 05:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
us you got to bring that up now didn't
 
05:18:31.070 --> 05:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
we solve that last year to you really
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
what you still angry I'm still salty
 
05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
about it but that's a different
 
05:18:38.470 --> 05:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
discussion um but but to your point
 
05:18:40.590 --> 05:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
could we could we have a scenario where
 
05:18:42.470 --> 05:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
both survive we could but I think where
 
05:18:44.390 --> 05:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
our industry right now with the existing
 
05:18:46.990 --> 05:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
businesses the upheaval in the time for
 
05:18:48.750 --> 05:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
that shift to take place we would lose a
 
05:18:50.590 --> 05:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses in that space and I
 
05:18:52.230 --> 05:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
think that's where these these are a lot
 
05:18:53.670 --> 05:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
of people people that have spent you
 
05:18:55.270 --> 05:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
know millions and millions of dollars
 
05:18:56.948 --> 05:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
investing in their businesses are not
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
prepared to take the chance on what that
 
05:18:59.788 --> 05:18:59.798 align:start position:0%
upheaval would look like and how long it
 
05:19:02.350 --> 05:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
might take if that makes
 
05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
sense representative pusc thank you Mr
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mike for taking my
 
05:19:08.280 --> 05:19:09.510 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mike for taking my
question

05:19:09.510 --> 05:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:19:11.670 --> 05:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh it has to do with New Hampshire and
 
05:19:13.990 --> 05:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
tourism of which the Restaurant
 
05:19:17.910 --> 05:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
Association is a huge piece would
 
05:19:22.990 --> 05:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
this not having to have uh food tarnish
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
the reputation of New Hampshire as a
 
05:19:28.548 --> 05:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
family type place where you want to go
 
05:19:30.030 --> 05:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
bring your kids in the summer and the
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
winter and the restaurants uh you'd have
 
05:19:35.708 --> 05:19:35.718 align:start position:0%
bars but very few restaurants that would
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
be familyfriendly which is where tons of
 
05:19:41.590 --> 05:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
money come out of thank
 
05:19:43.470 --> 05:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question
 
05:19:45.548 --> 05:19:45.558 align:start position:0%
representative pusk
 
05:19:49.230 --> 05:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
but after 9 it's all hell break well
 
05:19:50.510 --> 05:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question because
 
05:19:52.270 --> 05:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
again I think there's also an argument
 
05:19:54.548 --> 05:19:54.558 align:start position:0%
to be made that you need all kinds of
 
05:19:56.350 --> 05:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
levels in the system right so you need
 
05:19:58.270 --> 05:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
those kind of late night places for the
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
younger crowd and you need the you know
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
the breakfast and lunch places and I
 
05:20:03.628 --> 05:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
think that I don't know that it would
 
05:20:06.670 --> 05:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
tarnish our image necessarily but I I do
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate you raising the fact of how
 
05:20:09.750 --> 05:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
important the rooms of meals taxes to
 
05:20:11.390 --> 05:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and the good
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
work that all of our member businesses
 
05:20:14.590 --> 05:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
do in raising that and collecting it on
 
05:20:14.600 --> 05:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
do in raising that and collecting it on
your

05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:20:19.708 --> 05:20:19.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
thought uh well actually I was going to
 
05:20:24.350 --> 05:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
say before thank you thank you Mike is
 
05:20:27.990 --> 05:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I think that today was a great
 
05:20:29.670 --> 05:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
experience for the four new members of
 
05:20:32.030 --> 05:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
the committee to really get their feet
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
wet and the knowing about liquor laws
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and the Nuance of liquor
 
05:20:37.760 --> 05:20:39.270 align:start position:0%
and uh and the Nuance of liquor
legislation

05:20:39.270 --> 05:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:20:42.350 --> 05:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I will also say that uh given that we
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
had no sponsor that um this is one of
 
05:20:47.070 --> 05:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
the reasons why I never I I always
 
05:20:48.670 --> 05:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
thought the idea that that committees
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
could kill a bill the same day they
 
05:20:54.070 --> 05:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
heard it is a shame because the person
 
05:20:56.190 --> 05:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
you know it should at least get another
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come in and and speak to
 
05:21:01.310 --> 05:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
their bill um you will learn that this
 
05:21:04.470 --> 05:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
is the only committee that that uh that
 
05:21:07.830 --> 05:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
does everything by subcommittee um and I
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
do it because
 
05:21:12.350 --> 05:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh I think it it really we want to show
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
anybody who who has a bill that comes to
 
05:21:16.190 --> 05:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
this committee that they're going to get
 
05:21:18.548 --> 05:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
a fair Shake we're going to really hear
 
05:21:21.230 --> 05:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
them out um sometimes people will tune
 
05:21:23.390 --> 05:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
in and say oh my God these people are
 
05:21:25.070 --> 05:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know they're just going to kill that
 
05:21:27.430 --> 05:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
thing so fast make your head spin but
 
05:21:29.230 --> 05:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
but I think that it's important that we
 
05:21:31.590 --> 05:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
have this conversation we have the time
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
and this is the reason why we that we
 
05:21:36.150 --> 05:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
are a highly respected committee and I
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
think that also most important is that
 
05:21:40.350 --> 05:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
by the time we come to an answer what
 
05:21:42.470 --> 05:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
comes out of this committee um we're
 
05:21:45.510 --> 05:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
pretty uniform uh in in support and that
 
05:21:48.910 --> 05:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
and that's because we we give every Bill
 
05:21:51.390 --> 05:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
its due diligence I've always said every
 
05:21:54.190 --> 05:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
bill has a grain of truth to it sometime
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
that grain is so small I can barely see
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
it but it's there and um so I want to
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you all for staying and through
 
05:22:05.110 --> 05:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
this and uh we'll get to do uh so next
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I'm not going to do Thursday
 
05:22:09.310 --> 05:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to Wednesday we'll have
 
05:22:12.910 --> 05:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll do the liquor subcommittee and
 
05:22:13.990 --> 05:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
then we have tomorrow we're going to be
 
05:22:16.430 --> 05:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
doing the banking and their banking
 
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
bills so we'll uh do one in the morning
 
05:22:20.230 --> 05:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
one in the afternoon I haven't figured
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
out which one I want to do but Wednesday
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
next week it'll be just Wednesday um I
 
05:22:28.470 --> 05:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
do need everyone to uh decide what uh
 
05:22:31.110 --> 05:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee you want to be on
 
05:22:32.948 --> 05:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
so for your new members the old members
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to stick you on the old
 
05:22:39.628 --> 05:22:39.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:42.430 --> 05:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
so you need to send me an email and let
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
me know what subcommittee you want the
