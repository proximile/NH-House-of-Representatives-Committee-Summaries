00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm thank you good morning let's try
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
this again the time being just after 10
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
on June 28th I'm calling to order the
 
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 align:start position:0%
Judiciary subcommittee on house bills
 
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
314 and Senate bill 255.
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
although we have two bills
 
00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
um that will be before this committee
 
00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.710 align:start position:0%
um that will be before this committee
um

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the two bills
 
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
isn't completely parallel and so I think
 
00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
we should pursue one bill at a time
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
unless anyone has any other feeling and
 
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
um taking the house bill first
 
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that we begin with house
 
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
bill 314.
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the expectation of privacy
 
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
in the collection and use of personal
 
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.689 align:start position:0%
in the collection and use of personal
information

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
the reason this bill is in the
 
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that the members of the
 
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
committee felt that it was very
 
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.290 align:start position:0%
committee felt that it was very
important

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
it was uh addressing a timely issue
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
but as important as it is that is how
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
complex the issue is and that we needed
 
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
more time to be able to
 
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.249 align:start position:0%
more time to be able to
um

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
delve into
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
what was necessary
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
for uh and helpful for us to do now and
 
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
what really isn't appropriate
 
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
for us a state as against uh the
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
national government
 
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.810 align:start position:0%
national government
um

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 align:start position:0%
when we last looked at the bill uh of
 
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
course we had a lot of testimony and we
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
also had at least one Amendment
 
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.689 align:start position:0%
also had at least one Amendment
uh

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
but where today just going to try to get
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
a sense of where we want to go we would
 
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
be meeting today and then we will not be
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
meeting again until September uh
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
following house rules uh
 
00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
but that does mean that if we identify
 
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
areas where we want to delve deeper that
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
gives us time uh for the members of the
 
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
committee and for the members of the
 
00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
public who are interested to help gather
 
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
um I think is all that I need to say to
 
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
open the discussion
 
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
open the discussion
um

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Lynn do you have anything
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
you want to add
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
um no I I well I do have just a couple
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
of things and I I guess what I would say
 
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
is um I I agree with you your initial
 
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
remark that the
 
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
the overlap
 
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
the the relationship between 255 and 314
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
is is it it certainly doesn't sort of
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
neatly fit together I agree with that
 
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.590 align:start position:0%
neatly fit together I agree with that
um

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
but what what I had
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
um been been hoping uh that we might do
 
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm not really
 
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me that it's possible
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
to do this but I wonder if it would be
 
00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:58.610 align:start position:0%
to do this but I wonder if it would be
worth

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
worth
 
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
seeing if
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
uh because 255 is dealing with
 
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
deal deals with the Privacy issue with
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
regard to private businesses basically
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
and and 314
 
00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:15.170 align:start position:0%
and and 314
um

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
particularly if we amended it in a way
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
that that said
 
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.350 align:start position:0%
that that said
314

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
314
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
applies to private businesses only to
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
the only and so far as 250 in other
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
words it reference 255 by three in 314
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
314 applies to private businesses only
 
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
insofar as it uh through as 255 covers
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
private businesses and then
 
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh the other part of 314 we're dealing
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
with governmental entities
 
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.809 align:start position:0%
with governmental entities
um

00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
that would be an expansion of of uh 255
 
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
which would apply only to governmental
 
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
entities and and for for example one of
 
00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:07.259 align:start position:0%
the big differences there would be that
 
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
314 does create a private right of
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
action against governmental against the
 
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.950 align:start position:0%
action against governmental against the
government

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and so I don't know
 
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
whether it would be possible to do that
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
or not and one of the things that I
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
think would be
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
would I would think would be very
 
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379 align:start position:0%
helpful in that regard is
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's clear that that the that the draft
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
that the people who brought us 255
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
spec I mean the the you know sort of the
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
experts from around the country spent a
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
lot of time on it and and did you know
 
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
it did a very good job in my view of of
 
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
their Drafting and I'm wondering if if
 
00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:48.889 align:start position:0%
their Drafting and I'm wondering if if
uh

00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
we might be able to uh
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
engage some of those people to take a
 
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
look at 314 and see if that melding of
 
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:00.980 align:start position:0%
314 and the way I describe could be done
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
in a in an effective way because one one
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
of the problems that I see with 314 now
 
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
is the the way it's worded it's it it
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
says in
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
a section
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
507 H2 Roman numeral two
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
no governmental entity shall acquire
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
collect retain or use any personal
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
information of any individual residing
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
um where are you in in that oh I'm sorry
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's on page uh page one of the bill and
 
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm line uh 24.
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh it says no government entity shall
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
acquire collect retain or use any
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
personal information of any individual
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
residing in New Hampshire from any third
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
party provider
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
and so that's just a that's sort of a
 
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
blanket statement it would be I mean if
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
you just if you if you ended your
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
consideration right there you'd you'd
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
basically say no no government entity
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
could ever have any private information
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
acquired from a third party
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
which would be really I mean that would
 
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
be kind of crazy but then if you go on
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
to if you go on to the to section three
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
you see that it there's a huge a number
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
of exceptions so effectively
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
subsects the way it's it's drafted
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
subsection two kind of says Thou shalt
 
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.370 align:start position:0%
subsection two kind of says Thou shalt
not

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.650 align:start position:0%
not
accept

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
in these in the areas covered by
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
subsection three which is huge I mean
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
just just for example read
 
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.170 align:start position:0%
just just for example read
3A

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
3A
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
um it says some some paragraph two
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
though the the broad prohibition doesn't
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
apply to personal information acquired
 
00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:46.459 align:start position:0%
collected retained or used by any state
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory or administrative agency when
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
such acquisition collection retention or
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
uses within the agency's regulatory
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
investigative adjudicatory or
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
administrative function well
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
on its face that would seem to I mean
 
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
you know except for situations where a
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency or some agency of
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
government was acting in bad faith
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
um except for that you'd almost think
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
that almost everything would be accepted
 
00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:17.339 align:start position:0%
because if uh if an agency if an agency
 
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
collects information that they have some
 
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
reasonable basis that they think they
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
think is necessary to do their job
 
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
presumably that would fall within that
 
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
unlike 255 I think
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
314 may be drafted in a way that is just
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
it try it oversimplifies and that may
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
mean that it would take
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
a considerable amount of work to make it
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
fit in and that's why I was kind of
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
wondering if some of the people who are
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
who have had some expertise in this area
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
might uh might be willing to take a stab
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
at trying to make it fitted
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
because for example
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
um collects the information necessary
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
um what if the department of motor
 
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.509 align:start position:0%
um what if the department of motor
vehicles

00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.590 align:start position:0%
vehicles
um

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
honoring the fact that we live in a
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
capitalist system decide that they want
 
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:26.420 align:start position:0%
to sell all that information
 
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:37.329 --> 00:12:37.339 align:start position:0%
with that regard to existing law
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
isn't that an example of or is that an
 
00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
example of how a regulatory agency might
 
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
you know thinking for the best of
 
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.310 align:start position:0%
you know thinking for the best of
reasons

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:49.910 align:start position:0%
reasons
um

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
I utilize
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
this information in a way that really
 
00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
isn't Central to their regulatory
 
00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:00.250 align:start position:0%
isn't Central to their regulatory
investigative

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:00.260 align:start position:0%
investigative
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory or administrative function
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
and there are other examples I mean I
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
just sure sure no I agree with you I
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
think that's I think that's right so and
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
I think we do see that we see that with
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
the 911 system
 
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
um where the information is collected
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
for a very specific reason
 
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.090 align:start position:0%
for a very specific reason
but

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
um there other agencies want to get a
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
crack at that information also
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
the basic problem I think is a you know
 
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
is is real it's not it's not imaginary
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.150 align:start position:0%
or you know
um

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
or just creative things yeah no I know I
 
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
agree with you I agree and I think I
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
that's why I think 314 really is
 
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:50.459 align:start position:0%
important uh it's just uh they
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
I would I would like it if I mean it
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
would may it would seem to me it would
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
make sense if we could do it to have a
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
sort of comprehensive privacy
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
um bill that that applied both to
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
private and private Enterprise and to
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
the government and to the government I
 
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
hear that now and just at the
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
introductory level anybody else on the
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
committee have something to say
 
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you madam
 
00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:17.210 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you madam
chair

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I remember we were on a subcommittee
 
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
about this bill last term
 
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
um the the one you have a very long
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
memory very long memory so the the thing
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
I like about 314 is it concerns
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
government entity and I think if we're
 
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
gonna start with regulating it should
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
start with ourselves in my opinion and
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
then what I like about 255 is that it is
 
00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:46.019 align:start position:0%
like more it it's very specific and very
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
like um there's strong definitions so I
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't know how we can
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
work that through to make it so maybe
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
if we start with government entity and
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
then see if it works and then expand it
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
to non-government entities
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
um if that works I mean
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
why can't we just have a law that says
 
00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.019 align:start position:0%
you can't share personal information
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
that's it right like I don't
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
do we have to go WIC in specific or can
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
we kind of just stay wrong one of the
 
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
problems representative Alexander is
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
that you make it if you make it too
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
simple then what would the legislature
 
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.129 --> 00:15:33.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks
 
00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:37.009 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks
um

00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:37.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
just looking at 314
 
00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
I think it's interesting that the Clause
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
above the one that representative Lynn
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
just pointed out
 
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.530 align:start position:0%
just pointed out
um

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
the first thing that it states is really
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
Broad and it just says individuals shall
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
have a reasonable expectation of privacy
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
and personal information including
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
content and usage given or available to
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
any third party
 
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.829 align:start position:0%
any third party
um

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
providers of information and services
 
00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
not available to the public so that's on
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
line 21. so it starts off with this very
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
broad statement about what 314 is doing
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
and then it's not really until all the
 
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.100 align:start position:0%
way toward the bottom of the bill online
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
26 that it says action against a
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
non-government entity shall not wait
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
where do you see that online 26. page
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
two line 26
 
00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:34.569 align:start position:0%
two line 26
um 507

00:16:34.569 --> 00:16:34.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
yeah so it doesn't really seem it I know
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
we've thought about this as a
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
government only Bill but it seems to
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
only basically carve itself out as a
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
government-only bill down at the very
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
bottom and so I don't know if that sort
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
of lends itself to merging in with the
 
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:52.610 align:start position:0%
of lends itself to merging in with the
other

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
um concept because the other concept
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
taking care of all those other entities
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
um essentially one's leaving one out
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
this one's leaving the other group out
 
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.530 align:start position:0%
this one's leaving the other group out
and

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
um just the way this is put together
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
seems really confusing because it starts
 
00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.449 align:start position:0%
seems really confusing because it starts
out

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
not really specifically talking about
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
government entities then it starts
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
carving out a whole bunch of uh
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
exceptions and then only at the very end
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
does it basically clarify that it
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't create an action against a
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
government entity so I don't know if
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's any knowledge about why it's
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
structured that way or if it has to be
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
well you know oh I'm sorry I I just I'm
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
sure of course if I if I may you know I
 
00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:33.299 align:start position:0%
was gonna say I I you raise your that's
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point and that is a
 
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.289 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point and that is a
point

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
um that was that was what I attempted
 
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
to um to deal with in the amendment that
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
I had but and you'll see that what the
 
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.850 align:start position:0%
I had but and you'll see that what the
amendment

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
what the what my proposed amendments is
 
00:17:53.049 --> 00:17:53.059 align:start position:0%
to to uh
 
00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:58.340 align:start position:0%
to uh uh to 314 amendments
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
yes right and what that was attempted to
 
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
do is to
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
um amend
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh 507 H2 Roman numeral one that starts
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
on line 21.
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
um so that it would say
 
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:18.740 align:start position:0%
their reasonable expectation of privacy
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh applies
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
information given uh or available to a
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
third-party Pro I'm sorry
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
I better read an individual should have
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
a reasonable expectation of privacy and
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
personal information including content
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
and usage given or available to
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
third-party providers of information and
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
services I I took out the the word and
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
so providers of third party of
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
Information Services comma not available
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
to the public comma and then the
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
important thing is I added the words and
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
provided to a governmental entity so
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
that and I I know I had a I had a long
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
discussion with representative erf about
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
this I think he disagreed with that
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
limitation but my my purpose in having
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
that limitation was to say to make to
 
00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
make that this section sort of congruous
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
with the cause of action section so that
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
the the expectation of privacy
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
was was only when the when the
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
information that's in private hands gets
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
into the hands of the government then it
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
becomes private and I and I guess what I
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
would say is
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
if we were gonna you know combine 255
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
and 314 in some fashion
 
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
that Roman numeral one
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
of section H2 where it's sex where it
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
says except as otherwise provided in law
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
I mean if we adopted 255 that could be
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
the the other law that would apply you
 
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
know to the private
 
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:00.740 align:start position:0%
uh to the private sector information
 
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
no no no no no problem
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
um does anyone else on the committee
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
have any introductory comments that they
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
want to make
 
00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:11.529 align:start position:0%
want to make
um

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:11.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
seeing the uh
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative the prime sponsors of
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
314 are representative Earth and
 
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
um representative erf is here and um
 
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:29.900 align:start position:0%
if I'm not
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
incorrect he's here also with a
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
colleague from his district who's a
 
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
former representative and that's
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
um uh former chairman Neil Kirk and if
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's all right with the committee I
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
would suggest that
 
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
the monsieurs Earth and Kirk come up and
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
help us start our conversation here
 
00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
about 314 including how it may or may
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
not relate to 255 is are you willing to
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:20.690 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
well you know when you build a building
 
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.590 align:start position:0%
well you know when you build a building
with

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
lots of different pieces first you have
 
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
we have to figure out two things what
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
you want to build and what the pieces
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
are that you have available to build
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
with and that's our
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know it's like Robert Frost when you
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
build a wall you have to figure out what
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
you're Walling in and Walling out
 
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.210 align:start position:0%
you're Walling in and Walling out
um

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Kirk chairman Kirk
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
Mr Kirk
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%

00:21:54.299 --> 00:21:55.390 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman Neil Kirk from
where

I'm very pleased to be here and I
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
 
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.830 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
you

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.730 align:start position:0%
you
um

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
there is a connection between the two
 
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
bills but it's tenuous
 
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.810 align:start position:0%
bills but it's tenuous
um

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:07.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
255 deals with large private companies
 
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:15.500 align:start position:0%
which collect information about
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
individuals through a variety of ways
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
and provides opportunities for
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
individuals to uh
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
opt out of the company using that
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
information for a variety of purposes
 
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:36.049 align:start position:0%
 
314

00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
314
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
Deals Only with information that comes
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
from third-party providers it's a very
 
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
limited subset of the information that's
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
out in the world
 
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.750 align:start position:0%
out in the world
so

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
the only information that is covered by
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
314 is information in the hands of a
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
telephone company or Social Service
 
00:22:59.810 --> 00:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
Media or a financial institution or
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
something like that where there is a
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
business relationship between the
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
individual and that company
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
so the individual decides he wants
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
telephone service provides information
 
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
to Verizon Verizon is now a third party
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
provider of information and services not
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
Goods Goods is covered by 255 but not
 
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
Goods Goods is covered by 255 but not
314.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
314.
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
and then the question is to what extent
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
can Verizon use that information
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
for other purposes other than to provide
 
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:31.460 align:start position:0%
the services for which the individual
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
arranged a relationship
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
under U.S Supreme Court decisions there
 
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
are no limitations that information
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
under their third party Doctrine is the
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
property of Verizon in effect and they
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
can do what they want with it you have
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
no expectation of privacy in that
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
information the purpose of 314 is to
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
change that it's to say that when an
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
individual gives his information to one
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
of these third-party providers of goods
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
and services
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
that provider can only use that
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
information to service the individual
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
whose account was established they do
 
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419 align:start position:0%
not have the right to use that
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
information for other purposes
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
okay if
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
a state agency wants to get that
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
information or a private sector
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
individual wants to get that information
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
they have to go through a process
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
they can't just get it by asking under
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
if the police want information from
 
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
Verizon about Neil Kirk they can either
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
call them up directly and say hi would
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
you give it to me or if that's not the
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
way Verizon operates they can get a
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
subpoena which is not based on probable
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
cause just a subpoena and then Verizon
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
while it could fight it would not and
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
they would get the information if this
 
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
spill were to be passed the police would
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
have to get a search warrant based on
 
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
probable cause if they wanted to get
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
that information and they would have to
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
do it on an individual basis the police
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
for example today could collect
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
wholesale information about everybody in
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and create a database if
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
they wish to do so they don't but if
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
they wish to they could
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
If This Were to pass they could not do
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
that except on an individual basis based
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
on probable cause so the focus of 314 is
 
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
very different from the focus of 255.
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
there is a connection as representative
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
Lynn has pointed out I'm not sure it's
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
worth merging the two to deal with that
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
connection but there is a relationship
 
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.789 align:start position:0%
connection but there is a relationship
um

00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives Lynn's Amendment would
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
basically eliminate
 
00:25:38.289 --> 00:25:38.299 align:start position:0%
the part of this bill that deals with
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
individuals because this bill really has
 
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
two parts to it one the government
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
restriction part that's h two two line
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh 24 and then the individual part the
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
private sector part which is h21 line
 
00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.669 align:start position:0%
private sector part which is h21 line
21.

00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
21.
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
If you eliminate section one and
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's Amendment
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
effectively did you kept the language
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
but by adding the words at the end about
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
a government you basically eliminated
 
00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:15.539 align:start position:0%
um the the right of of Neil Kirk is an
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
individual to tell Verizon not to give
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
his information to somebody
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
um so that's the effect of your
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh it would only apply to
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
government and you're right again
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn the substantial list
 
00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:32.059 align:start position:0%
of exceptions was designed after meeting
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative and I with many
 
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
government agencies was designed to say
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
look whatever the agency is doing
 
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
currently it should be allowed to
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
continue that's the practice
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
so this has a a significant impact
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's example is one
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
but it would it would apply to the
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
police which is why they oppose this
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
because it would require them to get a
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
warrant a search warrant rather than
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
simply a subpoena to get information
 
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
from these folks if they wanted to do
 
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.590 align:start position:0%
from these folks if they wanted to do
that

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.370 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
I hope representative Lynn might rethink
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
his objection to having the private
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
individual have the same protection
 
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
um that is provided in this bill I think
 
00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:19.220 align:start position:0%
that's very important but I understand
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
his position and if that were the to be
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
the wish of the committee it's still
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
worth passing the bill because what
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
we've done is basically to say we're
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
keeping the situation that currently
 
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
exists in existence and if in the future
 
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059 align:start position:0%
the legislature thinks that the
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
insurance department or the health and
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
human services department should not be
 
00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:41.299 align:start position:0%
able to access
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
these third-party providers to get
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
information about Neil Kirk then the
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
legislature could make a separate
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
determination in each of those cases
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's important about
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and indeed to some extent
 
00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
about 255 is that it deals with the new
 
00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
constitution well not really 255 I
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say that 314 deals with the
 
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
new constitutional privacy provision
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
which is very Broad in terms of
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
protecting personal information from
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
government intrusion
 
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.289 align:start position:0%
government intrusion
um

00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
so this would be the first legislative
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
statement about its concept of what that
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment means it's saying that
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
government agencies in certain ways May
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
and certain ways may not access personal
 
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.029 align:start position:0%
and certain ways may not access personal
information

00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:31.490 align:start position:0%
information
um

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'd be willing to um
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
work with representative Lynn or the
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee or produce any kinds of
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
amendments that you want if you
 
00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
have a policy position on what you want
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
this bill to accomplish
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
and it can be made to accomplish many
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
things but the concern that this bill
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
addresses to repeat
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
is information that you voluntarily give
 
00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:58.100 align:start position:0%
to an organization that's providing you
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
information or services this does not
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
apply to Goods
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
this does not apply to anything you buy
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
in stores
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's just where you the individual have
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
a relationship with a provider of goods
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
and services defined in the bill
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
and want to maintain the privacy of that
 
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
information and not have the provider
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
use that information for its own
 
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
purposes to sell it to make it available
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
to other private sector organizations to
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
make it available to government I think
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's a very important privacy
 
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
protection for the citizens of New
 
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.649 align:start position:0%
protection for the citizens of New
Hampshire

00:29:29.649 --> 00:29:29.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
when I give information to the telephone
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
company I don't want them revealing it
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
to Microsoft
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
none of Microsoft's business the
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
relationship that I have with the phone
 
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.889 align:start position:0%
relationship that I have with the phone
company

00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm very pleased if police in order
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
to get that information would have to
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
get a search warrant I mean if they
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to get that information from my
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
that my house they'd have to get a
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
search warrant
 
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.769 align:start position:0%
search warrant
uh

00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:53.389 align:start position:0%
uh
anyway

00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
um as you know I'm passionate about
 
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
privacy so uh you'll you'll you'll
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
deduct whatever points are necessary for
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
my passion to make a reasonable decision
 
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you um
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative or if you have anything
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
I think he covered it pretty well
 
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee have any
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions that they would like to ask
 
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
the witnesses a representative tour
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
yeah just just one question along the
 
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
way you had said that the Supreme Court
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
had eliminated
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
um this provision or something along
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
these lines previously was that
 
00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional grounds or what was the
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
what was the reason that the Supreme
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
Court found that the
 
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.289 align:start position:0%
that the
um

00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
existing law and sorry if I'm not
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
stating that prep perfectly couldn't
 
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.230 align:start position:0%
stating that prep perfectly couldn't
exist

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn is better qualified
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
than I am to answer that question but
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
basically the U.S Supreme Court said the
 
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
Constitution did not protect that under
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
any concept of privacy that was their
 
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the U.S Constitution
 
00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:12.230 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the U.S Constitution
and

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
our state supreme court
 
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think generally has followed that with
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
certain exceptions for example there's a
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
very famous case where our Supreme Court
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
said you have a constitutional right to
 
00:31:26.289 --> 00:31:26.299 align:start position:0%
privacy uh with respect to
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
garbage that you throw out in a black
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
plastic bag on your front lawn so to
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
speak when that's picked up and taken to
 
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
the dump by the garbage people however
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's done
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
you have not given up your expectation
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
of privacy in that and the police if
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
they want to search it would have to get
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
a warrant
 
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
but in New Hampshire there is no
 
00:31:53.049 --> 00:31:53.059 align:start position:0%
constitutional or legislative
 
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
privacy protection with respect to
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
third-party provider information that
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
you've given to it now clearly somebody
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
could bring a legal case and claim that
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
under the new Constitutional Amendment
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
that indeed is protected information
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
the situation hasn't Arisen yet and I
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
would hope that the legislature in light
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
of the amendment would adopt this bill
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
and others like it to Define what kind
 
00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
of information government has remember
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Amendment only
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
applies to government it doesn't apply
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
to the private sector it limits
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
government's acquisition of information
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
about its citizens I would have liked it
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
to apply to the private sector but
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's not the way the amendment went
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up yes of course
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
so that Supreme Court decision in if I'm
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're saying it
 
00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
basically said the right does not exist
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
the right to privacy over date it does
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
not exist in the Constitution but it
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
didn't prohibit something like this from
 
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
being added which would establish it
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
we gather information and have a sense
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
of where where we want to go from here
 
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
and benefit of course from the thinking
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
of people who are
 
00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:17.810 align:start position:0%
of people who are
um

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
following these issues is there anyone
 
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.730 align:start position:0%
following these issues is there anyone
here

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
um in the uh
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
in the room who would like to comment
 
00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:30.740 align:start position:0%
um on
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
help advise and guide us as to where we
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
should go
 
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:40.370 align:start position:0%
should go
yes

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
good morning representative good morning
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative Tim McGee one of the
 
00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:48.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
sorry I haven't seen you before seems
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
that every time that we have one of
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
these hearings I'm either
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
at a healthcare conference
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
like the one week of the session that uh
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
was at the
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to tell you a little bit
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
about it so please indulge me if you
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't mind this is going to be a little
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
bit of testimony that probably uh would
 
00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:12.419 align:start position:0%
have helped but we had a lot of esteemed
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and knowledgeable folks
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
testifying so some of my original
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
testimony might have been redundant
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
but as this bill has taken shape
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
um I'll throw in a couple of couple of
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
cents so my first two terms were spent
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
on Commerce in 1996 to 2000.
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
and back then I think one of the things
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
that I ran on was the right to privacy
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
and as you know that predated our
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment and representative Kirk was
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
chairman of Finance I believe then right
 
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
and we had a common interest in the
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
right to privacy then
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
as I do now and I was entering uh
 
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:51.260 align:start position:0%
Healthcare as a medical device
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
commercialization guy and HIPAA was new
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
and nobody knew what it meant we all
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
thought it would protect our privacy but
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
everybody ignored the second p in HIPAA
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
does everybody here know what that that
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
second P stands for the portability
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
that means that your data is incredibly
 
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:14.099 align:start position:0%
portable so you go to one Pharmacy and
 
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
they know that five minutes earlier you
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
were at the last Pharmacy
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
well fast forward 22 years and
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
was watching the Super Bowl last last
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
year during covid and I'm kind of a
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
gadget guy I've developed a few apps
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
I've got nine patents in cardiovascular
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
devices and once I stumped Apple
 
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
they um they wrote back and said we
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do with your app
 
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
we've never seen anything like it it was
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
the best compliment I'd ever had
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
the Super Bowl commercial had a device
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
on it during covid called The Q Health
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
device cue and if you're not familiar
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
with it you should all get one I have no
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
interest in the company
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
but it was revolutionary it was a tiny
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
little box about this big maybe three by
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
two inches and it's a diagnostic device
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I should tell you that I am chief
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
commercial officer for a publicly traded
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
medical device company a Diagnostics
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
device company
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
not this one I wish so this little
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
device Q Health aims to be in
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
everybody's house if for every every
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
consumer to help diagnose a whole host
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
of elements their first was covid
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
and I immediately ordered this
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
subscription device because it was going
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
to provide me with the ability to travel
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
back and forth across the border to my
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
company headquarters in Toronto and at
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
the time you needed a certain type of
 
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
approved covid test you couldn't just
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
have the little free government lateral
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
flow test or the one you could buy from
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
the drugstore you needed the higher
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
level PCR test so do you remember when
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's all the different types you know
 
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
certain were approved for airline travel
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
well this one would allow you to do it
 
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
in your house with a video Proctor
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
anyhow the point of this is there's
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
those big long Eula agreements end user
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
licensing agreements that everybody just
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
Scrolls through some of them don't even
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
make you scroll through it until the
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
green acceptor submit bar shows up and
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
you've probably had this question and
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
testimony how many of you actually read
 
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
those right the answer is nobody at
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
least no consumer reads those Justice
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
Lynn reads them and then writes back to
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
them and asks for a new copy and sends a
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
red line with track changes right right
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
he and I are the only ones that ever do
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
that and then our accounts get canceled
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
no just kidding but if you want to use
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
those apps or those devices or
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
if you're a business that wants the
 
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.849 align:start position:0%
if you're a business that wants the
consumer

00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
to buy those devices and that's the
 
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
focus I want you I want to bring to this
 
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:44.099 align:start position:0%
discussion if you're a business like
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
mine or like Q health or one of the
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
zillions of other you know Venture
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
Capital funded or private Equity funded
 
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
businesses that's trying to make a go of
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
it and there's thousands and thousands
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
of these businesses many of them trying
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
to come to New Hampshire
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm actually trying to move my
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
company to New Hampshire here in the
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
midst of a bit of a restructuring
 
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.609 align:start position:0%
midst of a bit of a restructuring
um

00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
they need this what's that I'm sure the
 
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.050 align:start position:0%
they need this what's that I'm sure the
government

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
he just might he just might he just
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
might we enjoy a nice relationship so if
 
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'm one of those businesses and and when
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
I was asked to co-sponsor this
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
and I spoke with some of the interested
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
parties like Microsoft you know happily
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
signed on I said as long as it's
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
reasonably close to Connecticut and
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
nothing like California
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
and when I look at this chart and I see
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
how many X's we have on here I think
 
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
well that's a state that I'd like to do
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
business in
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
because that's a state where my
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
consumers My Consumer customers where it
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
will be easier to be not just a B2B
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
business to business
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and distributor but also a
 
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
business to Consumer and what were you
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
holding up there oh this is the uh the
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
the tracker that shows what states have
 
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
done what uh and
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
okay and which bills contain right to
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
access right to correct and right to
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
delete that's what resonates
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
even at the the town committee level if
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
you're giving a legislative update to
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
your local committee
 
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
you can tell them hey I worked on your
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
right to privacy they get that but did
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
you know you don't have the right to
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
delete yourself
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
and that rings a bell I mean how
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
exciting is that to deliver that to your
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
constituents in some fashion the right
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
to electronically delete yourself
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
nobody believes that that's even even a
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
possibility it's the number three when
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
you turn that turn it sideways and you
 
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
go down here and New Hampshire
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
is maybe the only state or one of the
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
very few states where the pending
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:59.930 --> 00:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
all the boxes and someone behind me will
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
Private Ryan
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
well private right yeah yes thanks for
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
bringing that one up minus on x minus on
 
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
AI yes
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
um don't get me started on chat GPT if
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
you don't know what it is you should you
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
um but sure I think though those are two
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
things that maybe are better left for
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.430 align:start position:0%
the next
um

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
the next session like representative
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
Kirk mentioned uh happy to give you my
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
opinion on it
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I think you've probably had a lot of
 
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
discussion on private right of action
 
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.210 align:start position:0%
discussion on private right of action
already

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:49.220 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
and um maybe best left for for the next
 
00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:56.579 align:start position:0%
one what what you have as representative
 
00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
Lynn as amended I think is a pretty good
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
step and would it's personally widely
 
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:03.890 align:start position:0%
step and would it's personally widely
supported

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
supported
 
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
my in terms of full disclosure our
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
particular business would not directly
 
00:41:10.609 --> 00:41:10.619 align:start position:0%
benefit from passage of this one way or
 
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
the other we do not have a consumer
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
product uh in the mix or planned to be
 
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
in the mix anytime in the next two years
 
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
so there's no I have no particular
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
disclosure or no particular conflict
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
with the passage of the solicitation or
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
I probably wouldn't have sponsored it
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
um but from a bit
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
one would hope
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
one would hope but at least from a
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
business perspective I can tell you from
 
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.770 align:start position:0%
business perspective I can tell you from
Healthcare

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:35.780 align:start position:0%
Healthcare
 
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
businesses and people who are trying to
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
bring products into the market and make
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
it easy for payers and providers payers
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
and manufacturers
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
to encourage consumers to utilize their
 
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
products in their homes and you know
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
self-diagnose or get health care
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
information they all all those consumers
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
have to click on those end user
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
licensing agreements have to agree to
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
allow their health care data to be in
 
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
the cloud somewhere and they'll do it
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
more readily if they know they have
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
control of the data we want consumers to
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
be involved with their own health care
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
we want them to utilize the tools and
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
that goes for anything as simple as go
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
into the drugstore look at the tests
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
that you can buy the A1C test the STD
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
tests just go into a Rite Aid or a
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
Walgreens or a CVS ask them where the
 
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
home test kits are and you'll see Celiac
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
rheumatoid arthritis A1C you know for
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
your blood sugar you see them advertise
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
on TV Everly well is a big provider
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
any number of male male away kits Colo
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
guard you know if you're thinking about
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
getting a cool and they give you the you
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
know do it at a box and send it away you
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
have to sign you have to go in log in
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
register your kit there's a Eula
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
agreement you're agreeing to have your
 
00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
data transferred people are reluctant to
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
do that because they're putting data
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
into the cloud if they knew they had a
 
00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:05.339 align:start position:0%
way to control that data better they're
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
more likely to use those and people are
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
more likely to get those preventative
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics done and that's a good thing
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
for the world of healthcare so thank you
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
very much pass the Bill does anyone have
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
just just one question
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
um because the previous testimony we
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
heard that this pertains to services but
 
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
not to products and given the cue Health
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned my my aura ring is at
 
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
home charging you know a device that's
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
also a service does that
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
um does that
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
preclude that kind of Distinction or or
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
do you see it a workable divide funny
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
enough a product like the Q Health they
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
basically give you the device it's um in
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics they call it almost like a
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
reagent rental model they just give you
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
the hardware and you're buying a
 
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.670 align:start position:0%
the hardware and you're buying a
subscription

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
subscription
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh for it and then
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
um you do pay for the consumable test
 
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.589 align:start position:0%
um you do pay for the consumable test
kit

00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
kit
 
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
so so there's a there is a there is a
 
00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:14.579 align:start position:0%
service like they perform the so you pot
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
you buy the little consumable test kit
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
they give you I'm sure there's some
 
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
Capital costs that they build in because
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
I know the little test kits don't cost
 
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
you know as much as they charge you for
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
them and then there's a subscription
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
service so it's kind of both
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
that that makes sense so it's not
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
good Focus
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry more on
 
00:44:37.619 --> 00:44:39.109 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry more on
the

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:40.730 align:start position:0%
the
the bills

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
is it can you connect your question
 
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
to the bills before us yeah I'm sorry if
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
I wasn't clear I I was just trying to
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
determine whether this distinction
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
that's in the bill between goods versus
 
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
Services is something that will become
 
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
unworkable going forward so the the data
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
service so let me try to clarify um
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
they house your data and they these
 
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.050 align:start position:0%
they house your data and they these
diagnostic

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
diagnostic
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
um providers that it's all speak to
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics specifically you know lab
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
lab tests home health kits any of those
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
and there's just hundreds and hundreds
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
of them from cholesterol tests to all
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
kinds of things you know from Little
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
Finger sticks smeared on on a card send
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
it away get your cholesterol Celiac all
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
those things they house that data
 
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
they'll send it to your provider they'll
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
track it they'll advise you and many
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
times the key the the Big Money Maker
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
for them is not that you paid 50 bucks
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
or 150 or 199 dollars to see if you may
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
be on the Celia Spectrum right so you
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't eat wheat it's really that
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
they want to sell that data to all the
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
people that sell drugs that can help you
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
or all the people that sell insulin if
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
your A1C is high so the real key to them
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
is the data monetization
 
00:46:03.839 --> 00:46:04.910 align:start position:0%
is the data monetization
right

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
so for you to have control of that in
 
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
some fashion you may agree that you'll
 
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.329 align:start position:0%
some fashion you may agree that you'll
have

00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
you you'll limit the resale of your data
 
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.349 align:start position:0%
you you'll limit the resale of your data
limit

00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:17.099 align:start position:0%
some of it right but it'd be nice to
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
have complete control of that
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
you'd be more apt to find like say what
 
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
I would personally feel better to know
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
what my A1C is let them share with my
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
doctor but not let them share it with
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
the entire world of world of big Pharma
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
or or every insurance underwriter
 
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
see where I'm going with that
 
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so so you don't think that having a
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
product tied to the collection of that
 
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
data leaves a big this leaves a loophole
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
for people to get around this but
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
because they could say well it's not a
 
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
surface it's the good that I that I sold
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
to you I I guess I don't know for sure
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
and if there's a loophole maybe we
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
addressed and we see it uh indirectly in
 
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
some of our use
 
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.410 align:start position:0%
some of our use
um

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
on our computers where you have to
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
consciously agree
 
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
to how the data is going to be used I I
 
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
do believe the MDR does that the device
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
regulations in Europe does address it
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
differently yeah and and more
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
stringently uh for instance uh you can't
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
email people you can't even so much as
 
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:33.140 align:start position:0%
email direct email marketing in Europe
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
for medical devices and things so yeah
 
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
they're a bit more stringent
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our country has not done
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
that and so for those of us who refuse
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
to participate in
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
all this Corruption of our society
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
we have limited access as a result uh
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking the time
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
sorry we missed you before and glad
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
you're here now
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
um who else and I see the municipal
 
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:11.210 align:start position:0%
um who else and I see the municipal
Association

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you madam chair for
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
allowing me to comment today in h
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
queries with the municipal Association I
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
did uh send a rather lengthy letter to
 
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
the committee last week
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
um that our subcommittee last week that
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully you all received I'm not going
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
to go into great detail there I'm
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to answer any questions
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
anyone may have about that
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank you for the
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come in after you've all
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
discussed this because I think I better
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
understand maybe where the the
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee's going here
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
I certainly agree with um
 
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
with you madam chair uh with this the
 
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
DMV example that you gave earlier that
 
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
packaging that information together and
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
reselling it doesn't seem like something
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
that government should do and I I don't
 
00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
think we have any
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
objection to prohibitions of of
 
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
government doing that
 
00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
um just one note on that point is
 
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:08.660 align:start position:0%
you may want to make sure that
 
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
information held by the government that
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
could be obtained in other ways such as
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
through a right to no law example is
 
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.630 align:start position:0%
through a right to no law example is
also

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
um it that's also clear that there's a
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
harmonization between kind of this
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy that you're
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
working on along with
 
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
um the protections already in 91a
 
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
um as far as
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
um I guess just a brief summary of some
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
of the issues we raised and I did talk
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
with representative erf uh back in
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
January and February about this
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and we had some really good and I
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
think productive conversations
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
um we would like to see in House Bill
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
314 some clarification of the the
 
00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
definition of third-party providers
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
I note my letter that some of those
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
um listed providers utilities really are
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
government owned or interact pretty
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
extensively with the government there's
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
some Provisions in our law about exactly
 
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
how that
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
um you know non-paid payment of water
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
for example bills would be collected
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
through your local tax collector we just
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
really goes to our core point which is
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
we want to ensure that government
 
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
continues to function
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's really what we want to see happen
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and we were also hoping that there
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
could be clarification on
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
um what the prohibition on government
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
was that's uh that that
 
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two that has been
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
discussed extensively
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
um just to ensure that it's clear that
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about information that's
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
not publicly available I think that
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
really just goes to some of the
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
committee's discussion about the
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
structure of the bill might be a little
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
confusing for those who are not uh
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
well versed in in in the law which may
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
be the case for many
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
um of the volunteers running local
 
00:51:10.619 --> 00:51:12.470 align:start position:0%
um of the volunteers running local
government

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
um and we just want to make sure that
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
when they read it they understand what
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to and not supposed to
 
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.930 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to and not supposed to
do

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
um and I guess the last point is that
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
um has been discussed briefly here today
 
00:51:25.079 --> 00:51:26.750 align:start position:0%
um has been discussed briefly here today
but

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
um I think that there has to be some
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.970 align:start position:0%
sort of
um

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
in intent or or a skincare element for
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
the violation on the government's behalf
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see a situation where a
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
third party provider is providing has
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
decided to give the government
 
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.750 align:start position:0%
decided to give the government
information

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
that either is beyond the scope of the
 
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
government's request or is
 
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
otherwise in violation of the chapter
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
that then results in the government
 
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.190 align:start position:0%
that then results in the government
um

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
the government being liable for any sort
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
of violation certainly it's the case as
 
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.710 align:start position:0%
of violation certainly it's the case as
uh

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
as I believe Mr Kirk described you know
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
if we have a very specific
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
thing that the government is request
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
specific piece of information the
 
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:20.900 align:start position:0%
government is requesting
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
whether that's the reward or whether
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
that's through a subpoena or whether
 
00:52:28.089 --> 00:52:28.099 align:start position:0%
that's simply just a request
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason that third party
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
provider decides to hand over the entire
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
customer folder or file to the
 
00:52:36.059 --> 00:52:37.849 align:start position:0%
customer folder or file to the
government

00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
um the mere fact that we receive that
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
isn't something that we think should
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
result in liability for the government
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
presumably whoever's in charge of that
 
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.829 align:start position:0%
presumably whoever's in charge of that
case

00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
um is going to properly dispose that
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
particularly if it's a criminal case
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
properly dispose of that in accordance
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
with existing
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
um evidentiary retention requirements
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
um at the conclusion of that case and we
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to give rise to some sort of
 
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.890 align:start position:0%
don't want to give rise to some sort of
liability

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
that's obviously different than if the
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
case go then if the government goes out
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
with bad faith and requests information
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
they know is in violation of the chapter
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
so we think that's a distinction that
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
should be made
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify kind of where that
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
where that lies and that's really my
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
last three points in my letter
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to take any questions
 
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
anybody has
 
00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
I don't think so and thank you very much
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
for sending that letter to us the
 
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.490 align:start position:0%
for sending that letter to us the
information

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
that comes in is helpful as we try to
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
figure out where we go from here thank
 
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.210 align:start position:0%
figure out where we go from here thank
you

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
um anyone else here
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
well that's a surprise
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all very much so now we
 
00:54:06.359 --> 00:54:08.089 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all very much so now we
have

00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
had before us
 
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
um we have two bills
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
and chairman Lynn has articulated a very
 
00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:20.420 align:start position:0%
strong and clear argument
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh of why he believes that the bills are
 
00:54:28.609 --> 00:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
related to each other and might in fact
 
00:54:28.619 --> 00:54:29.210 align:start position:0%
related to each other and might in fact
um

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:31.940 align:start position:0%
benefit from being combined
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
in order to avoid
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
um conflicts in
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
in each of them although we understand
 
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
that one has to
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
is dealing with the government and one
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
is dealing with private
 
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.089 align:start position:0%
is dealing with private
um

00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
Matthew could I make just one other
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
comment absolutely no I I do I do think
 
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
I I guess what I would say I do think
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
that it would
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
that there that we should at least
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
explore the possibility of combining the
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
two bills but the other point that that
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
I would that I would make is this
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
um my sense and I you know obviously
 
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
my sense may not be consistent with the
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
way the committee looks at it but
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
um my sense is
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
that 255
 
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.010 align:start position:0%
that 255
is

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
if not ready to go very close to being
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
ready to go I mean I could see a few
 
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
minor from my perspective a few minor
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
things that we might want to change and
 
00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:38.099 align:start position:0%
uh uh I think some of them I I proposed
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
in amendments but I think that's very
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
very close to being ready to go 314 I
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
think has is you know probably has
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh much more work to be done and
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
although I think it should be I mean I
 
00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
think it would be worth looking into
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
combining it with 255 I wouldn't want
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want the
 
00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:01.510 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want the
the

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
amount of work that might be necessary
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
to do that to
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh to sort of undercut the the
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
importance of 255 uh because I think for
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
even as a standalone bill that's very
 
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:18.059 align:start position:0%
worthwhile and and you know we we ought
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
to consider that that on its own if uh
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's not
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
if we were if we were gonna
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
um if if combining it with 314 would
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
mean that both of them did we didn't
 
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:32.540 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:56:34.609 --> 00:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
let me just
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
um Talk for just a moment about uh
 
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
timelines uh
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
we have retained two bills
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
um I believe until
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
November 16th something like that to uh
 
00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
on retained bills
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and we can do anything with those
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
retained bills we can uh that we can
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
ordinarily do with the bill we can vote
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as it is we can vote on to
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
pass with an amendment and we can vote
 
00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
um an expedient to legislate and of
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
course we do have the last option which
 
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
I probably nobody wants which is uh
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
uh to keep for further study which would
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
be next summer we would look at this
 
00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.950 align:start position:0%
be next summer we would look at this
again

00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
um and so that we can do and in in
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
carrying that out we can keep the bills
 
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
separate or we could through the
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
amendment process combine them so that's
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
one part schedule the other thing to
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
keep in mind is that we have uh from
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
September 11th to 15th to file new
 
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
legislation if we uh were to decide that
 
00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
if any individual were to decide that
 
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's the route they wanted to take and
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
then there is a third route and that is
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
as a a committee
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
I believe that I don't believe this has
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
changed perhaps since Grant could tell
 
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
me that we could
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
apply to the rules committee to ask for
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
permission for example to introduce a
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
new bill that did not conform with those
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
schedules I mentioned up until now so we
 
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
have a lot of flexibility
 
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
and we know we have the summer to do uh
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
to the extent that anyone is willing to
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
do the hard research that is necessary
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
we certainly know that although a number
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
of the people in the room
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
um did not volunteer to to speak uh
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
today that they have indicated to us
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
formally and informally that they are
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
available to help if we need additional
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
information or additional guidance and
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so we have those resources to work
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
with we that this committee would not
 
00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
meet again until September and then
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
sometime between then and mid-november
 
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
the full committee would meet at the at
 
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:18.380 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn's call
 
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
to vote on all our recommendations so
 
00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.630 align:start position:0%
to vote on all our recommendations so
that's

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
I just want you to understand the the
 
00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:30.260 align:start position:0%
time uh structure I did see
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
chairman Kirk raised his hand did you
 
00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.339 align:start position:0%
want to add something could you please
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
go to the microphone because I know how
 
00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
much you like this but these are all
 
00:59:43.609 --> 00:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
um on video or whatever it is
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman when you
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
first called upon me I thought the
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
subject before the subcommittee was 314.
 
00:59:52.559 --> 00:59:53.870 align:start position:0%
subject before the subcommittee was 314.
um

00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
and it seems as though you're not taking
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
separate testimony on 255 but I do have
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
some comments on 255 if that is of
 
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
interest to the committee uh yes it is
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
we were we're interested in in testimony
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
on both
 
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
with your permission may I hand out
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
something to committee members of course
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
actually if I hand it out even without
 
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 255 as I understand it is
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
basically a
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
bill that has been promoted throughout
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
the country by Microsoft Corporation and
 
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
it's been adopted in several States I
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
think Connecticut is one of them
 
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.450 align:start position:0%
think Connecticut is one of them
um

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
or I'm not privy to why they're doing
 
01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:13.579 align:start position:0%
this most large corporations
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
come in to oppose a state when it
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
proposes to regulate in a particular way
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
such as California has done because most
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
of these large corporations want uniform
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
regulation throughout the United States
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
and would prefer to have Congress
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
legislate and preempt States from taking
 
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
a different position
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
for reasons known to Microsoft they've
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
taken a different approach and they are
 
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
going around to various States I think
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
all of the states to try to have this
 
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:48.380 align:start position:0%
particular legislation passed
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
obviously Microsoft is a for-profit
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
business so in some way this bill is
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
important to their business model
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
but what that might be I don't know
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
I support the informational privacy
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
provision or aspect of this bill
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
but not its current form
 
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
it needs Amendment four of them in
 
01:02:11.819 --> 01:02:13.190 align:start position:0%
it needs Amendment four of them in
particular

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.390 align:start position:0%
particular
first

01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:02:16.809 --> 01:02:16.819 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is set up every company
 
01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:20.180 align:start position:0%
that is subject to this bill
 
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
can have its own method for opting out
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
and its own procedures for opting out
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
as was alluded to before with the
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
exception of Representative Lynn most of
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
us are not going to take the time even
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
if we want to opt out to understand how
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's done in each of the different
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
companies because they will all have
 
01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:44.579 align:start position:0%
different ways to do it how many clicks
 
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
will be required for us is unknown
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I would suggest is
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
that there be a uniform way for people
 
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
to opt out of the um
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
the use of their personal information
 
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
held by these companies so that it's
 
01:03:05.089 --> 01:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
easy for us as human beings we have very
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
little time we don't read these long
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
descriptions it's hard for us to
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
understand how to go to column A or menu
 
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
a and then finally wind up on menu B and
 
01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
then actually opt out
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
if you were to do that it would produce
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
a method at least that makes it possible
 
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
for people to take advantage of the
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.119 --> 01:03:32.569 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
whether it's intended or not our lives
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
are too busy and too fast-paced for the
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
legislature to require all of us to go
 
01:03:41.809 --> 01:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
through this process to opt out so an
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendment I think needs to be drafted to
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
simplify the process and make it uniform
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's the key thing uniform
 
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.210 align:start position:0%
that's the key thing uniform
secondly

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:52.940 align:start position:0%
and not as important as the first
 
01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
this bill covers very few companies you
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
have to have at least a hundred thousand
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire subscribers before your
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
before these Provisions apply so most
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
companies in New Hampshire aren't going
 
01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:06.980 align:start position:0%
to be affected this really applies to
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
larger National companies
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
01:04:14.049 --> 01:04:14.059 align:start position:0%
that that's fair
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
as consumers in New Hampshire why are we
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
saying that our information held by
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
national companies should be treated
 
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
differently from information held by New
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies why shouldn't I have
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
the right to opt out from a smaller
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
company maybe just a New England company
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
or a unique New Hampshire company why
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
only from the national companies now you
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
can imagine why Microsoft has done this
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
it eliminates a lot of potential
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
opposition but for us as as consumers
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
the distinction is is not very clear
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's a good
 
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.569 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's a good
distinction

01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:49.970 align:start position:0%
distinction
thirdly

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
thirdly
 
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.770 align:start position:0%
thirdly
um

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
is an opt-out bill whatever privacy
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
protections are in it you only get them
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
if you act if you don't act
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
you don't get them
 
01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that if you're really
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
interested in protecting privacy that
 
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
you make this an opt-in
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
if you make this an opt-in
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
the first amendment is unnecessary
 
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
because all of the companies will do
 
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
their very best to make it absolutely as
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
what should be the default position how
 
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
do you want to protect privacy in New
 
01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:34.490 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
do you want us do you want to make our
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
citizens work for it
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
then this bill does if you want to make
 
01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.569 align:start position:0%
then this bill does if you want to make
it

01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:05:43.849 --> 01:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
the default position you need to change
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
this from opt out to opt-in
 
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.630 align:start position:0%
this from opt out to opt-in
finally

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
the enforcement Provisions in this bill
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
benefit the companies
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.049 --> 01:06:03.059 align:start position:0%
number one there's no private right of
 
01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:05.329 align:start position:0%
number one there's no private right of
action

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:05.339 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's only the AG who can enforce this
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
number three when he enforces it he has
 
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
to give the company 60 days notice if
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
the company corrects the problem within
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
60 days he can't bring the enforcement
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
if if I were in Microsoft I would think
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
that a passage of these bills would
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
enable me to
 
01:06:33.599 --> 01:06:34.789 align:start position:0%
enable me to
um

01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
tell consumers that Microsoft is very
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about their privacy and has
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
done a lot to protect it when in fact
 
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
this bill does not really protect
 
01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.450 align:start position:0%
this bill does not really protect
privacy

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
opt-in is complicated sorry opt out is
 
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.089 align:start position:0%
opt-in is complicated sorry opt out is
complicated

01:06:49.089 --> 01:06:49.099 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:06:52.849 --> 01:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
and there's no enforcement so even if I
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
opt out and Microsoft chooses
 
01:06:59.049 --> 01:06:59.059 align:start position:0%
um or some company like Microsoft
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
chooses not to honor this or in some way
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
makes a mistake I can't do anything
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
but you know the AG is overworked and
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
understaffed so if you're going to pass
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
the bill as it is at least give the AG
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
the staff and the money uh to enforce
 
01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:19.430 align:start position:0%
the staff and the money uh to enforce
this

01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your attention I'd be
 
01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
pleased to answer any questions but
 
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.710 align:start position:0%
pleased to answer any questions but
um

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:27.299 align:start position:0%
the problem with this bill is it
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
promises but doesn't deliver and
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
that really disturbs me if the
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
legislature were to go along with that
 
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.089 align:start position:0%
legislature were to go along with that
position

01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you
 
01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:42.410 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you
questions

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:44.579 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thanks for that
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
testimony um focusing on the
 
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
um first sort of provision of an
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
amendment that you had suggested
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
um and and that resonates I think
 
01:07:56.569 --> 01:07:56.579 align:start position:0%
because it is a very complicated world
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
and having to learn every company is
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
sorry this is so the question was do you
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
have a sense of how that uniform process
 
01:08:13.609 --> 01:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
would be established by What entity
 
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
um and whether or not our passage of
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
something like that would
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
influence the way all these existing
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
companies are already operating
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
I wish I had the knowledge to answer
 
01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
that question I don't I know there's a
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
problem I don't have a solution that's
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
just beyond me but there are people with
 
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
technical expertise who you should be
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
able to contact who can provide those
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:45.169 --> 01:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:08:45.179 --> 01:08:46.910 align:start position:0%
any other questions
no

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again very much for this
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
information I'm going to ask a question
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
again and I bet I'm going to have a
 
01:08:55.849 --> 01:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
different answer this time is there
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
anyone in the audience who would like to
 
01:08:59.410 --> 01:08:59.420 align:start position:0%
speak now
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
but just so I didn't forget it
 
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
in the back row uh thank you for the
 
01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.289 align:start position:0%
in the back row uh thank you for the
opportunity

01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
um my name is Curtis Barry I do
 
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
represent Microsoft and had not intended
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
to speak today but as they say in the
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
political debates since my client's name
 
01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
was invoked I felt felt an obligation to
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
respond to some degree I'm not an expert
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the content of Senate Bill 255 to the
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
extent of How It's been developed over
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
the last several years and this have not
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
been involved with the stakeholders who
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
have done that from state to state but I
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
can respond to a number of things one
 
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
thing right off the bat to
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk's Enforcement issue
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh two points one is I don't think he's
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to to know this in
 
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
the the budget and I think I sent this
 
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
all to you on an email
 
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
in the budget that was signed uh last
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
week by the governor the senate had
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
added Provisions to changes to House
 
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 in one change to House Bill one
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
that addresses the Attorney General's
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement concerns Doge changes
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
specifically are adding data privacy
 
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:27.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement to the laundry list of
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
obligations of the Consumer Protection
 
01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:31.610 align:start position:0%
obligations of the Consumer Protection
Bureau

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
Bureau
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
the second is as the Attorney General's
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative at the public hearing
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
referenced they are funded by what they
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
call a settlement fund that's currently
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
in statute capped at five million
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
dollars the balance goes to the general
 
01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
fund the Senate amendment that was
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
adopted increases that to six million
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
dollars so they have an extra million
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
dollars to to play with
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
and then in house bill one uh the Senate
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
added three positions and these were
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
changes that were worked on uh I hope
 
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not divulging any confidences but
 
01:11:08.649 --> 01:11:08.659 align:start position:0%
between Senator
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald and a representative fairly
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
high up in the Department of Justice
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
they've added three positions a
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
paralegal and investigator and an
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
attorney specifically to address the
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue the second point I'll
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
make about enforcement and it needs to
 
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
be reiterated is as Mr Harkins who
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
represent who works for Microsoft
 
01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
testified at the hearing there is no
 
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
issue that has killed more bills privacy
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
related bills in this country
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
specifically this model than the right
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
of private action and if you look at the
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
chart that was referenced earlier you'll
 
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
see that the vast majority if not all
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
except California that have been enacted
 
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
do not have private right of action
 
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
I like to work on things I I like to say
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
I operate in the realm of the possible I
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
like to work on things that we can pass
 
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
and I do not have confidence that this
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
bill would pass with a private right of
 
01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
action in in the language
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
so specifically
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
um back to some of the representative
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
Kirk's comments
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
um this is I would not characterize this
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
as a Microsoft bill I think if you look
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
at the Coalition of folks or folks that
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
have testified in favor of this both in
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the house in New
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in other states there are
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of companies that that support
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.149 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk referenced his it's
 
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
if I understood him correctly uh his he
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
questions why
 
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
we would want to pursue legislation from
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
state to state because we want to seek
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
consistency and it should be dealt with
 
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
at the federal government that was Mr
 
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
Harkin's testimony we prefer Microsoft
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
prefers I'm sure a number of other
 
01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
stakeholders do a federal solution that
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
is not forthcoming hasn't been
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
forthcoming thus like other issues
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
people who support this particularly
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
state legislators who
 
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
value privacy brought forth the
 
01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
legislation on a state level
 
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
maybe that compels the federal
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
government to act maybe it doesn't I
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.229 align:start position:0%
don't know
um

01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
so it's it is on the consistency from
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
state to state basis that people will
 
01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
support this representative mcgu uh
 
01:13:24.169 --> 01:13:24.179 align:start position:0%
cited that uh in as part of his own
 
01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
support uh some of the stakeholders in
 
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
the private sector agree uh state by
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
state laws need to be as consistent or
 
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
uniform as possible to make it easy to
 
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
uniform as possible to make it easy to
comply

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
comply
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
but representative Kirk's proposed
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
amendments don't do that
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
in fact when you look at the chart and I
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
can give you some updates I made some
 
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
notes this morning since the hearing
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
Maine has introduced the bill that is
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
close to this model Delaware has
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill that's close to this
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
model and the states that have enacted
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
since the hearing include Montana Texas
 
01:14:01.689 --> 01:14:01.699 align:start position:0%
Indiana Tennessee
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
I think as we indicated earlier these
 
01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
are not all red States they're not all
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
blue States they're a good mix of red
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
and blue States because people across
 
01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
the country value privacy on the part of
 
01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
their consumer and I think the last
 
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
comment I'll make is I disagree that
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
this is ineffective because as I sit
 
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
here today I do not have rights over the
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
personal data that a private entity
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
company holds my personal data this bill
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
gives me rights so I'm happy to answer
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions of the best of my ability
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and miss um
 
01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Berry um we have a form here
 
01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:43.250 align:start position:0%
Mr Berry um we have a form here
um

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
that the International Association of
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
privacy professionals last updated
 
01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.530 align:start position:0%
privacy professionals last updated
619-23

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
619-23
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
but the the information you just gave us
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
differs a little bit in terms of I
 
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
believe unless I miss in terms of
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
laws signed to date
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
okay um so the iapp
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
um their website has two links that are
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
near each other on their website
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere under their resources
 
01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.350 align:start position:0%
somewhere under their resources
um

01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
the one I'm referencing is the map which
 
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
and I again I believe I've sent both
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
links one is the chart that will compare
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
state by state what are the elements
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
that are similar you know the X's or the
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
check boxes
 
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
um there's also a map available
 
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
color-coded map uh that displays what's
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
which states where a bill has been
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
introduced which states where a bill is
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
crossed to the second body which states
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
where it's passed and which states where
 
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's been signed into law Etc a few
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
other changes for example New York and
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
Vermont had bills introduced I believe
 
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
but they're not currently active so the
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
their status has changed over over time
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
and what was this effect what were the
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
new states that you've added to states
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
where so yep um the states uh where it's
 
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
signed into law that I believe have were
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
since the public hearing on Senate Bill
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
255. our Montana Texas Tennessee and
 
01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:19.610 align:start position:0%
255. our Montana Texas Tennessee and
Indiana

01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative Andrews did you have a
 
01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.750 align:start position:0%
representative Andrews did you have a
question

01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.450 align:start position:0%
question
did

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair I do have a
 
01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.610 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair I do have a
question

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
Mr Kirk's proposals the way I heard you
 
01:16:39.239 --> 01:16:40.430 align:start position:0%
Mr Kirk's proposals the way I heard you
testify

01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not really consistent with the laws
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
of the other states that they've passed
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
what if we did pass this how bad is it
 
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
going to be for the companies out there
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for you know all of the
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
entities and I wouldn't
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
answer on behalf of Microsoft to that
 
01:16:59.630 --> 01:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
question until I asked them that
 
01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.070 align:start position:0%
question until I asked them that
question

01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
um but other than to say it would be
 
01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.689 align:start position:0%
um but other than to say it would be
inconsistent

01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
inconsistent
 
01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:08.300 align:start position:0%
um and it's something that I've heard
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
for the last eight months or so working
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
on this model with with sponsors Etc in
 
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
stakeholders is that consistency is of
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:27.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the opportunity
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'll ask once again is there anyone else
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
in the room who would like to share
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
um information with us all in
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
hopes that it's going to help us help
 
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
guide us as to how we're going to
 
01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.810 align:start position:0%
guide us as to how we're going to
proceed

01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
I see no one else who is
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
interested so now it's back to us
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
where do you want to go from here
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
when would we take up some of like with
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
255 some of the small tweaks and things
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
like that that I some of which may be
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
big tweaks but
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
um when when do we take up the
 
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
discussions around those tweaks well as
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
um following house rules we may not meet
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:33.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
that does not mean that
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
conscious always of 91a that one or two
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
of us might you know
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
not work on uh avenues that we want to
 
01:18:51.239 --> 01:18:52.189 align:start position:0%
not work on uh avenues that we want to
pursue

01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
01:18:52.199 --> 01:18:53.990 align:start position:0%
pursue
and

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
by the same token again with less than a
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
qualm or individually we know that
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
people in the public who have views that
 
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
they will want to share can share that
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
with us we would not come together again
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
until sometime you know relatively early
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
in September but my hope would be that
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
when we came together in September we
 
01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.310 align:start position:0%
when we came together in September we
would

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
um be able to bring to the table as
 
01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.510 align:start position:0%
um be able to bring to the table as
individuals

01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
a much more developed view of where we
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
want to go
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
we have the the two threshold questions
 
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
keep these bills
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
separate considering each of them but
 
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
considering them separately or is there
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
any any benefit
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
creating the best possible legislation
 
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
do we combine and that obviously is a
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
threshold question
 
01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:01.970 align:start position:0%
threshold question
um

01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
and then we have the comments that have
 
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
been made uh informed comments that have
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
been made by a number of people
 
01:20:10.679 --> 01:20:11.390 align:start position:0%
been made by a number of people
um

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association uh
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
Microsoft uh let current informal
 
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:21.050 align:start position:0%
Microsoft uh let current informal
legislators

01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.790 align:start position:0%
legislators
um

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
and the members of the committee to help
 
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
inform us
 
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh what I don't want to have happen and
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
I have no control obviously is that we
 
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
say okay fine we've done this and now
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
let's put this all in the back of
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
the pile of things to do and we won't
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
look at it again as individuals until
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
September because these are complicated
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.669 align:start position:0%
issues and
um

01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
I would think that
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
they do need some thoughtful
 
01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.290 align:start position:0%
they do need some thoughtful
involvement

01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.250 align:start position:0%
involvement
um

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
and one possibility is that as
 
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
individuals or perhaps as two of us
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
work on specific amendments that could
 
01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.130 align:start position:0%
work on specific amendments that could
then

01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
be reviewed by the committee and not
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily with the expectation that
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
they'll be accepted but with the
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
expectation that it gives us something
 
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
to focus on to decide where we want to
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
go from there or we might find that
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
someone has just the perfect suggestion
 
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:40.030 align:start position:0%
someone has just the perfect suggestion
um

01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
the timing is awkward I would rather
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
that we could say you know next week
 
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
let's get together again
 
01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.490 align:start position:0%
let's get together again
um but

01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
um for some reason I'm an office speaker
 
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.189 align:start position:0%
and so
um

01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
but I do live by the rules so
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's my situation
 
01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.330 align:start position:0%
that's my situation
um

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
chairman Lind oh first I see
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Andrus has thank you
 
01:22:11.649 --> 01:22:11.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
Madam chair sorry what I see here is
 
01:22:20.209 --> 01:22:20.219 align:start position:0%
two great bills
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
for privacy
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm questioning in my mind
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
if we combine them would we try to make
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
them too complicated
 
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
it would be a complicated law
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
personally I think we should keep them
 
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
separated I do think they need to be
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
tweaked to both of them
 
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.610 align:start position:0%
tweaked to both of them
and

01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:42.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
make sure in the end
 
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
that we're not worried about
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
outside businesses I know they have to
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
be protected but I think our big thing
 
01:22:58.610 --> 01:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
is the protection
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
of the citizen
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
because where I use a computer like I
 
01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
get a lot of emails I don't I don't want
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
from companies and I just at the bottom
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
it says unsubscribe when it comes to
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
working with the company I just don't
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
know why it can't be that simple if you
 
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't want your information shared with
 
01:23:22.729 --> 01:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
somebody and I just think we need to
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
work out things and I think it's going
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
to take a little time thank you
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you if I I know so little about
 
01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
all of this but if I could add one
 
01:23:33.179 --> 01:23:34.610 align:start position:0%
all of this but if I could add one
comment

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
um if you got that initial initial email
 
01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
as kind of a blind stab in the dark from
 
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:44.540 align:start position:0%
whomever sent it and you mark
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
unsubscribe what you have now done is
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
given them your email address
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:58.090 --> 01:23:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you madam
 
01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:01.970 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you madam
chair

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.410 align:start position:0%
think that
255

01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:10.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.410 align:start position:0%
um
I

01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
I just go back and ask myself why
 
01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
why is this bill being introduced it's
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
to create uniformity across
 
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
all states
 
01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.510 align:start position:0%
all states
but

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
what's stopping companies from doing
 
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
and I feel like
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
like incentive for us to even act on
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
this right now because there's nothing
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
stopping a company from doing these
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
things in here to begin with what
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
concerns me more is the citizens of New
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire passed an amendment concerning
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
government entities nobody else
 
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
I think what we should
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to combine these but what
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
um I think Neil Kirk raised a lot of
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
um great concerns with 255 I
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
if I wasn't against it before I probably
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
am pretty I think there's a lot there's
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
some changes need to be made what I
 
01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
looked at on here
 
01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
um but I I do want to look at 314 a
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:20.330 align:start position:0%
little bit more
um

01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
the biggest concern I have with 314 is
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
the enforcement
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
area of it I think that we can work on
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
some language there that would be
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
helpful for for me to get on board but
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
I I personally like I said before like
 
01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
to start with government and start with
 
01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
ourselves before we go anywhere else and
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
um you know I I have a sneaking
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
suspicion if
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
um 255 passes enough States and New
 
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't act I have a feeling
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
that all those big companies will jump
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
on board anyways so thank you
 
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say after listening to the
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
details on the the two bills and and and
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
um the way that they
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
um protect privacy they seem fairly
 
01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.030 align:start position:0%
um protect privacy they seem fairly
different

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
um that the the uh 314 Bill basically
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
talks about the collection and and
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
keeping of data and whether when it's
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
allowed the other Bill sort of gives
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
consumers a lot of individual control
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
over a lot of aspects of
 
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
um uh the specifics of how they can
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
control that data what they can do with
 
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
individual pieces whether they can can
 
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh opt out of some things and not others
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
um so it seems more difficult
 
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
thinking in that way to
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
to combine them even though they both
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
address necessary pieces of the question
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
of of privacy collectively so you know I
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
do sort of think the I actually think
 
01:26:54.649 --> 01:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
the 255 one probably is is further away
 
01:26:54.659 --> 01:26:56.510 align:start position:0%
the 255 one probably is is further away
than

01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:26:59.450 --> 01:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
um than the 314 in terms of of because
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
there are it does seem like there's some
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
changes needed even just to make it
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
um the way it's done in other states so
 
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
that would be my general thought right
 
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
now so my my understanding and tell me
 
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong is that the point that
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Andrus presented to us
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
um they're separate bills and uh
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
that there's reason for them to be
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
separate bills
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
is that something that at the moment of
 
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
the understanding we're not committing
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
to anything now we're not voting on
 
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
anything that that would be
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
um the general consensus of of the group
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
um that they are
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh yeah sure I'm sorry representative
 
01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
the only concern I have with 314 is if
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
there's any overlap
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
in 255 and if there's anything that
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
would would be you know contradictory
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
and just to double check and make sure
 
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be anything
 
01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:10.940 align:start position:0%
contradictory say in 255 that would
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
oppose 3 14. and then the other thing
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
with two I think they should both be
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
separate but um on three on 255
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
um the idea of opting in as opposed to
 
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
opting out should be
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
um potentially researched I think
 
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn yeah I was going to
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
say I I have no problem with keeping
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
them separate the the with it with the
 
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
exception of the the very issue you just
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
raised on the on the on
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
um we need to be careful if we're going
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
to do that we just need to be careful
 
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
that we're not that they're
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
that we don't have we don't create sort
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
of a conflict between the two
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
um for example 2 314 as originally
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
drafted without any without considering
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
any Amendment
 
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:09.649 align:start position:0%
any Amendment
um

01:29:09.649 --> 01:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
would would appear to create
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
a an expectation of privacy and personal
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
information that may be different than
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
what 255 talks about or at least in the
 
01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
at least the extent that it may apply
 
01:29:27.659 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
at least the extent that it may apply
to

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:29.130 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
to information held by
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
by uh private businesses for example
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
that are not covered by 255.
 
01:29:38.159 --> 01:29:40.310 align:start position:0%
that are not covered by 255.
um

01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a conflict maybe it isn't
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
but I all I think your point about just
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
being careful that we don't we don't
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
I like to be a problem solver and I'm
 
01:30:03.169 --> 01:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
feeling a little bit at sixes and sevens
 
01:30:03.179 --> 01:30:04.129 align:start position:0%
feeling a little bit at sixes and sevens
now

01:30:04.129 --> 01:30:04.139 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:30:04.139 --> 01:30:05.570 align:start position:0%
now
um

01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
I see that there are a lot of questions
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
before us that do need answers
 
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.070 align:start position:0%
before us that do need answers
um

01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
let's see that the official structure
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
I think gets in our way
 
01:30:19.679 --> 01:30:22.310 align:start position:0%
I think gets in our way
um

01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
but I don't personally feel comfortable
 
01:30:30.719 --> 01:30:32.570 align:start position:0%
but I don't personally feel comfortable
asking

01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
if we could have
 
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:38.510 align:start position:0%
if we could have
permission

01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
permission
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
to meet again
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of reasons why
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
they do not have us here
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
including the fact that the staff needs
 
01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
time to do all the work we haven't let
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
them do that they build people
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
responsible for the building need time
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
to make essential repairs and we all
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
need a cooling off period perhaps
 
01:31:02.639 --> 01:31:04.610 align:start position:0%
need a cooling off period perhaps
um

01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
and I just I guess my problem is I don't
 
01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
want July and August to be dead time
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative Divine so the big the
 
01:31:16.729 --> 01:31:16.739 align:start position:0%
big question for me now is if there was
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
a comparison between both bills to make
 
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
sure that they don't conflict how would
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
one go about doing that who do we reach
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
out to
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
um is there somebody already in place to
 
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
to look at that whoever drafted these
 
01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
other bills
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and working together as though my
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
initial response to that is we have
 
01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:41.470 align:start position:0%
initial response to that is we have
identified

01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:31:44.169 --> 01:31:44.179 align:start position:0%
in each of the bills
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
areas where we might want to make
 
01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:49.129 align:start position:0%
areas where we might want to make
changes

01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:49.139 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
nobody signed on the dotted line yet
 
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.110 align:start position:0%
nobody signed on the dotted line yet
so

01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.910 align:start position:0%
so
to

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:31:58.729 --> 01:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
to look at the existing language where
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
might not be the best way to handle it
 
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
in the timeline because we might want to
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
get a little closer to the final
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
language that we're considering
 
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
before we do that
 
01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
and we do have a couple of months you
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
know in September and October
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
um I can well imagine that
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn has already
 
01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
identified 16
 
01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh 16 amendments that he's going to
 
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
propose some of which will incorporate
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
the first ten but um and I say that as
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
he knows with great admiration for his
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
commitment to this committee and to this
 
01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.290 align:start position:0%
commitment to this committee and to this
work

01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
for that I appreciate very much
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
um but does anyone have any suggestion
 
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
to help me get past my feeling of
 
01:32:58.610 --> 01:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
had best use time well could I make this
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
suggestion since and
 
01:33:05.649 --> 01:33:05.659 align:start position:0%
since I'm as I've said before I'm
 
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
255 I'm
 
01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
personally I'm kind of comfortable with
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
it the way it is and I understand that
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
there may be change you know people have
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
different views in it there may be
 
01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
changes and that and you know and that's
 
01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:19.610 align:start position:0%
changes and that and you know and that's
fine

01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:20.990 align:start position:0%
fine
um

01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
so so my preference would be and I and I
 
01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
would volunteer to do this I I
 
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:29.510 align:start position:0%
would volunteer to do this I I
um

01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
would suggest that maybe I could work
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
with representative erf and uh
 
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative former representative
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
Kerr okay if they're willing over the
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
summer to try to make some changes
 
01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
to 314
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
um that would
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
you know that would maybe be helpful to
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
address some of the issues that have
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
have been discussed and try to come back
 
01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.110 align:start position:0%
have been discussed and try to come back
um

01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
to the committee in September with a
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
with uh proposed
 
01:33:59.930 --> 01:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
with some proposed language some
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
proposed changes and I'm wondering if
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
somebody if those who have
 
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
greater concerns about 255 might be
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
willing to do the same
 
01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
much for that is there
 
01:34:17.159 --> 01:34:20.750 align:start position:0%
much for that is there
um

01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
but is there someone who would like to I
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
mean I know you can get you'll get some
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
um I would be happy
 
01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.790 align:start position:0%
um I would be happy
um

01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.229 align:start position:0%
um
to

01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for looking at 255
 
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
um now that I have done that I see two
 
01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:43.490 align:start position:0%
um now that I have done that I see two
others

01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
um and let's see one Madam chair I don't
 
01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take the lead but
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's too much on my plate but if one
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
two three four this six three
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
um I think three of us can can do it
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
because we're not a majority
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and so we can
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to vote
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
very good
 
01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.790 align:start position:0%
very good
um

01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
and we will know that in in name on the
 
01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.669 align:start position:0%
and we will know that in in name on the
lead

01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
lead
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
um de facto
 
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
um okay anything else that we should
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
discuss right now
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
do people feel comfortable that we've
 
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
um if it's this were easy we wouldn't be
 
01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
here we would have already acted
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay then I um
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
say that we are finished with our
 
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on 255 and
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 255 and House Bill 214 and
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
we will meet again
 
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
as a full Committee in September
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you all very much for helping
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:43.849 --> 03:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
the time is 1 20 and I'm going to go
 
03:19:46.969 --> 03:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
ahead and open up the subcommittee work
 
03:19:51.230 --> 03:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill free 62 Dash FN
 
03:19:54.170 --> 03:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
which is an act relative to complaint
 
03:19:55.849 --> 03:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
procedures and cases before the
 
03:19:57.950 --> 03:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights
 
03:20:00.650 --> 03:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
I do apologize for our delayed start we
 
03:20:02.269 --> 03:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
went to the Human Rights Commission
 
03:20:04.730 --> 03:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
office and we were a little bit delayed
 
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
in getting back
 
03:20:09.710 --> 03:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to kind of open up
 
03:20:12.110 --> 03:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
by giving a little bit of an overview in
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
what we just heard because rep Andrews
 
03:20:17.929 --> 03:20:17.939 align:start position:0%
wasn't with us uh for that session so I
 
03:20:19.070 --> 03:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
wanted her to have a little bit of
 
03:20:22.370 --> 03:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
background and then I want to kind of
 
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
open it up if the committee has anything
 
03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
to say and then if anybody else would
 
03:20:28.730 --> 03:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
like to to speak
 
03:20:28.740 --> 03:20:31.370 align:start position:0%
like to to speak
so

03:20:31.370 --> 03:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:35.809 --> 03:20:35.819 align:start position:0%
overall what we heard was that
 
03:20:35.819 --> 03:20:37.730 align:start position:0%
overall what we heard was that
um

03:20:37.730 --> 03:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:41.630 --> 03:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
the number of of cases I guess I can
 
03:20:43.790 --> 03:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
give it over an overview of just
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
everything to start with the number of
 
03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
cases that they currently have pending
 
03:20:50.809 --> 03:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
right now is 230 cases and their oldest
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
case is
 
03:20:56.570 --> 03:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
from February of 2022.
 
03:20:59.150 --> 03:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
they currently have five investigators
 
03:21:01.370 --> 03:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
and they did just receive budget to hire
 
03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
four or more investigators
 
03:21:07.250 --> 03:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
they get about 16 new cases per month
 
03:21:09.889 --> 03:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
and the number of cases that they're
 
03:21:11.650 --> 03:21:11.660 align:start position:0%
closing per year
 
03:21:16.010 --> 03:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
averages around 225 cases so they are
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
getting through you know a pretty big
 
03:21:20.510 --> 03:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
chunk of of cases
 
03:21:20.520 --> 03:21:22.250 align:start position:0%
chunk of of cases
and

03:21:22.250 --> 03:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
it seemed like the data that we got from
 
03:21:27.230 --> 03:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
2022 the number of complainants that
 
03:21:30.410 --> 03:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
removed cases to court was 30 38 cases
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
which was 12.8 percent of the overall
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
number of cases that had closed
 
03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
the number that the respondent removed
 
03:21:41.090 --> 03:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
was 22 cases which was 7.4 percent of
 
03:21:42.650 --> 03:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
the overall
 
03:21:46.790 --> 03:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
number of cases so
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
and then the number that was closed with
 
03:21:52.010 --> 03:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
no probable cause was 34 and the
 
03:21:54.010 --> 03:21:54.020 align:start position:0%
settlement percent was 24
 
03:21:58.730 --> 03:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
and then the overall failure to locate
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
the party or failure to proceed or it
 
03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:11.150 --> 03:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
so it seemed like the number that are
 
03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
actually being
 
03:22:16.130 --> 03:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
removed to go to court isn't that high
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
anyhow but the most interesting piece
 
03:22:22.030 --> 03:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
for me was hearing that in in the EOC
 
03:22:25.190 --> 03:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
federally doesn't allow a responder to
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
move the K remove the case because they
 
03:22:29.330 --> 03:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
consider it retaliatory
 
03:22:31.790 --> 03:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire and Rhode Island are
 
03:22:34.309 --> 03:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
the only two of the 50 states who do
 
03:22:38.330 --> 03:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
allow for a case for a respondent to
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
remove the case
 
03:22:45.050 --> 03:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:47.809 --> 03:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the data that we found
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
that I think is really kind of the most
 
03:22:53.510 --> 03:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
important pieces because
 
03:22:55.910 --> 03:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
I do think you know with their increase
 
03:22:59.690 --> 03:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
in staff and whatnot that they are
 
03:23:01.670 --> 03:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
making Headway into their significant
 
03:23:03.830 --> 03:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
backlog which I think was part of the
 
03:23:05.929 --> 03:23:05.939 align:start position:0%
reason why we initially wanted to do the
 
03:23:07.490 --> 03:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee session was to make sure
 
03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:08.570 align:start position:0%
subcommittee session was to make sure
that

03:23:08.570 --> 03:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
was the overall arching problem of
 
03:23:15.469 --> 03:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
the committee being so backlogged being
 
03:23:17.210 --> 03:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
addressed and it seems like with the new
 
03:23:18.889 --> 03:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
budget and the fact that they are having
 
03:23:21.170 --> 03:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
so many new hires in addition to the
 
03:23:23.210 --> 03:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
four new investigators they're also
 
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
switching over three employees from
 
03:23:29.349 --> 03:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
part-time to full-time including a
 
03:23:34.010 --> 03:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
secretary a paralegal and the office
 
03:23:36.349 --> 03:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
manager will be switching from part-time
 
03:23:37.969 --> 03:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
to full-time and they'll also be adding
 
03:23:41.450 --> 03:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
a part-time intake coordinator so with
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
that said I'd like to open it up to the
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee if you guys have anything else
 
03:23:49.010 --> 03:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
rep Corrigan
 
03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:53.210 align:start position:0%
rep Corrigan
um

03:23:53.210 --> 03:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.769 --> 03:23:54.779 align:start position:0%
one thing is the number that go to
 
03:23:57.050 --> 03:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
number of cases it goes to a public
 
03:23:57.060 --> 03:23:58.490 align:start position:0%
number of cases it goes to a public
hearing

03:23:58.490 --> 03:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
before the uh Human Rights Commission
 
03:24:03.530 --> 03:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
they have seven Commissioners and three
 
03:24:05.750 --> 03:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
sit on a panel is very small
 
03:24:07.490 --> 03:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's about I think there's just been
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
three this year so apparently that's
 
03:24:12.170 --> 03:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
partially by Design they encourage uh
 
03:24:15.050 --> 03:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
the currency respondent they complained
 
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
and responded to subtle uh settle on
 
03:24:19.969 --> 03:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
their own whenever possible and that's
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
the most common outcome and followed by
 
03:24:24.889 --> 03:24:24.899 align:start position:0%
uh followed by
 
03:24:28.010 --> 03:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
followed by you know
 
03:24:30.290 --> 03:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
using sending it through federal or
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and also um even a large
 
03:24:36.110 --> 03:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
percentage of them are found no probable
 
03:24:38.809 --> 03:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
cause but that doesn't necessarily mean
 
03:24:40.990 --> 03:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
the case was frivolous sometimes the
 
03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
worker has a
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's a legitimately bad work situation
 
03:24:47.450 --> 03:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's not purely the that's where
 
03:24:49.130 --> 03:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
there's faults on both sides but it
 
03:24:52.190 --> 03:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't go far within the rubric of the
 
03:24:54.889 --> 03:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
employment employment law that is like
 
03:24:56.809 --> 03:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
most of what commission deals with other
 
03:24:59.389 --> 03:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
other issues whether it's like
 
03:25:00.530 --> 03:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
actually I don't know the exact
 
03:25:02.450 --> 03:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
percentage here but it's it's primarily
 
03:25:04.670 --> 03:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
employment law that they deal with they
 
03:25:07.010 --> 03:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
also deal with housing and public
 
03:25:10.309 --> 03:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
education and public accommodations and
 
03:25:13.490 --> 03:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
also there's a new uh pregnancy Fairness
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
Act they came in just uh the last year
 
03:25:19.490 --> 03:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:21.950 --> 03:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
so it seemed I mean it
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
of course they're the ones between the
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
it didn't it didn't seem to be a
 
03:25:27.769 --> 03:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
organization in crisis so it seems to be
 
03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh going well and they are they are
 
03:25:32.990 --> 03:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
expanding so
 
03:25:35.809 --> 03:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody else
 
03:25:40.190 --> 03:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:42.349 --> 03:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:25:44.870 --> 03:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
um I would recommend going forward
 
03:25:47.090 --> 03:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
recommend to the committee going forward
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
with the legislation to propose
 
03:25:51.710 --> 03:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
legislation and go getting that done
 
03:25:51.720 --> 03:25:52.429 align:start position:0%
legislation and go getting that done
um

03:25:52.429 --> 03:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:55.370 --> 03:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
as far as the human rights commission's
 
03:25:55.380 --> 03:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
as far as the human rights commission's
performance

03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
performance
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
um I would like to
 
03:26:02.750 --> 03:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
wait until we have the performance audit
 
03:26:05.150 --> 03:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
to make an assessment
 
03:26:09.070 --> 03:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't feel it's our place to
 
03:26:11.389 --> 03:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
micromanage the Human Rights Commission
 
03:26:14.030 --> 03:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
so I I just feel like you know they've
 
03:26:15.590 --> 03:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
given us they've shown us what they're
 
03:26:18.170 --> 03:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
doing it looks reasonable it looks fine
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
but let's get the um performance audit
 
03:26:22.370 --> 03:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
done thank you
 
03:26:24.950 --> 03:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you rep Delorenzo rep Anders did
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
you have any questions because you
 
03:26:28.490 --> 03:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
weren't able to actually be there um I'm
 
03:26:30.590 --> 03:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
not sure if kind of the overview and one
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
number that I I had missed on giving out
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
was five percent of the cases are also
 
03:26:36.290 --> 03:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
closed because of no jurisdiction just
 
03:26:37.610 --> 03:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
to kind of add up I was just going
 
03:26:38.929 --> 03:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
through to make sure my numbers added up
 
03:26:41.929 --> 03:26:41.939 align:start position:0%
to 100 do you have any uh questions
 
03:26:41.939 --> 03:26:43.490 align:start position:0%
to 100 do you have any uh questions
about

03:26:43.490 --> 03:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:26:46.610 --> 03:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you not really I mean my main
 
03:26:48.830 --> 03:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
concern is and I think the performance
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
audit might help us and where they're
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
going to hire more people is to make a
 
03:26:57.530 --> 03:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
quicker process
 
03:27:00.410 --> 03:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
for the claimant because waiting two or
 
03:27:02.570 --> 03:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
three years to get an answer is not
 
03:27:04.670 --> 03:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
acceptable I don't get what anybody says
 
03:27:08.750 --> 03:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
and we the process has to speed up but I
 
03:27:10.370 --> 03:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
think what we have to do where they're
 
03:27:11.690 --> 03:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
going to hire more and they have more
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
money we have to give them a chance to
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
see what happens thank you
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
I completely agree with that and that
 
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
was you know one of my biggest reasons
 
03:27:22.670 --> 03:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
for wanting to retain the bill was that
 
03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
it seemed like the the cases were taking
 
03:27:27.229 --> 03:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
so long but after going in and hearing
 
03:27:28.610 --> 03:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
kind of what they were doing and the
 
03:27:30.410 --> 03:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
fact that they did get the budget to
 
03:27:33.550 --> 03:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
essentially almost double their staff
 
03:27:36.650 --> 03:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to see where where
 
03:27:37.969 --> 03:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
things kind of go from there before
 
03:27:40.370 --> 03:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
adding in any new legislative or
 
03:27:42.050 --> 03:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
statutory changes that might try and
 
03:27:44.450 --> 03:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
make it expedite things because we don't
 
03:27:46.010 --> 03:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
want to have any unintended consequences
 
03:27:48.650 --> 03:27:48.660 align:start position:0%
with that and
 
03:27:52.250 --> 03:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
I didn't really see any areas that you
 
03:27:53.690 --> 03:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
know once
 
03:27:55.610 --> 03:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
if it seemed like if there actually was
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
Staffing available there would be no
 
03:28:00.190 --> 03:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
reason why the cases could not be closed
 
03:28:03.849 --> 03:28:03.859 align:start position:0%
within even a six-month time frame
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
so I do think once the backlog of cases
 
03:28:10.969 --> 03:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
is caught up that we will be seeing a
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
much better turnaround
 
03:28:12.720 --> 03:28:16.370 align:start position:0%
much better turnaround
and

03:28:16.370 --> 03:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:16.380 --> 03:28:19.250 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:28:19.250 --> 03:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
am not sure that there's any other
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
additional changes that necessarily
 
03:28:25.790 --> 03:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
needed to be made I did think it was
 
03:28:28.070 --> 03:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
definitely a very interesting piece that
 
03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
were one of only two states who do allow
 
03:28:33.229 --> 03:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
the respondent to remove it so for me
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of in agreement with rep
 
03:28:37.729 --> 03:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
dularenzo that
 
03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
the original bill that was in here you
 
03:28:43.130 --> 03:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
know seems like it would make sense but
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
I would like to hear from those who are
 
03:28:46.429 --> 03:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
before us
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
Rhett McLean you were part of the
 
03:28:51.710 --> 03:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
original study committee would you do
 
03:28:56.570 --> 03:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:58.790 --> 03:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
you you've pretty much covered the
 
03:29:00.769 --> 03:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
ground that we did in in the committee
 
03:29:04.250 --> 03:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
last year this is verbatim language uh
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
from SB 296 which came to us last year
 
03:29:10.490 --> 03:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
and this was total bipartisan
 
03:29:10.500 --> 03:29:12.290 align:start position:0%
and this was total bipartisan
legislation

03:29:12.290 --> 03:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:29:16.370 --> 03:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
um with support from both sides
 
03:29:19.610 --> 03:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and I think I would like to see this
 
03:29:23.090 --> 03:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
go forward with the original language we
 
03:29:25.250 --> 03:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
held it over last year again for some of
 
03:29:28.490 --> 03:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
the same concerns while we thought yet
 
03:29:30.590 --> 03:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
legally everything is right the U.S
 
03:29:33.290 --> 03:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court says the claimant gets to
 
03:29:35.570 --> 03:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
choose the Forum and you you talked as
 
03:29:37.670 --> 03:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
well about the EOC
 
03:29:39.830 --> 03:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that we were only one of
 
03:29:42.110 --> 03:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
two states so we said yeah we think it
 
03:29:44.570 --> 03:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
makes sense but at that time we were
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
hearing horror stories and we says if we
 
03:29:49.429 --> 03:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
if we take away the right of removal by
 
03:29:53.330 --> 03:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
the respondent is that just gonna Crush
 
03:29:55.729 --> 03:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
um something that is already burdened
 
03:29:55.739 --> 03:29:57.170 align:start position:0%
um something that is already burdened
and

03:29:57.170 --> 03:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:59.330 --> 03:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
um we had a much harder time getting
 
03:30:01.130 --> 03:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
data you apparently were able to get
 
03:30:03.469 --> 03:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
lots of great data out of them
 
03:30:05.570 --> 03:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
um but we had a very hard time getting
 
03:30:08.269 --> 03:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
data but ultimately we came to the same
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
place that you're at they're they're
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
looking at taking in at that time it was
 
03:30:14.929 --> 03:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
say 20 25 cases now you're saying it's
 
03:30:18.769 --> 03:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
down to 16 and the data that we had was
 
03:30:22.010 --> 03:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
the rate of removal wasn't as much we
 
03:30:23.690 --> 03:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
were I think talking about maybe 10
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
cases removed but even at 22 cases is
 
03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
being removed by the respondent it's
 
03:30:34.010 --> 03:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
um a percentage that I think the Human
 
03:30:36.590 --> 03:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission can absorb So based on
 
03:30:36.600 --> 03:30:37.550 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission can absorb So based on
that

03:30:37.550 --> 03:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to micromanage
 
03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
um they're they're able to fulfill uh
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
the language that that is you know
 
03:30:48.290 --> 03:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
required in the bill and with the
 
03:30:50.990 --> 03:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
budgetary editions that have been
 
03:30:53.929 --> 03:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
ongoing it sounds like they're able to
 
03:30:56.269 --> 03:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
kind of bust that pimple
 
03:30:59.389 --> 03:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
um much more effectively so I I think
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
all things being even uh that's you know
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
because I think I think it's just a it's
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
just a question of fairness as far as
 
03:31:10.010 --> 03:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
that goes there is a performance audit
 
03:31:13.010 --> 03:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
that we did petition the lpaoc for last
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
year which looks like it's going to go
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
forward which I think would give even
 
03:31:19.550 --> 03:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
more data and and you know maybe
 
03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
highlight other opportunities but I
 
03:31:24.710 --> 03:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't know that this is something that
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee can really do I did
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
quickly look over
 
03:31:30.889 --> 03:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
um the amendment from representative
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
Lynn which is kind of allowing
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
um for the respondent to remove
 
03:31:38.279 --> 03:31:39.229 align:start position:0%
um for the respondent to remove
um

03:31:39.229 --> 03:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
after the uh the the the the claimant
 
03:31:42.720 --> 03:31:43.790 align:start position:0%
after the uh the the the the claimant
does

03:31:43.790 --> 03:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:31:45.290 --> 03:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
um so that would be if the claim is
 
03:31:48.349 --> 03:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to remove after 180 days this
 
03:31:49.729 --> 03:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
would give
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
um if I read it correctly the respondent
 
03:31:55.010 --> 03:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
the right to remove about within 60 days
 
03:31:57.050 --> 03:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
after that but I think that gets back
 
03:31:59.809 --> 03:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
into the problem of you're allowing
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
either party to choose the Forum and
 
03:32:02.520 --> 03:32:04.010 align:start position:0%
either party to choose the Forum and
really

03:32:04.010 --> 03:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:32:04.020 --> 03:32:04.670 align:start position:0%
really
um

03:32:04.670 --> 03:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:07.969 --> 03:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
the the burden of proof is on the
 
03:32:11.450 --> 03:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
claimant and so they get to choose the
 
03:32:13.729 --> 03:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
form it's not equal with respect to
 
03:32:16.130 --> 03:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
choosing the Forum and so I I don't
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
really have anything to say based on all
 
03:32:19.969 --> 03:32:19.979 align:start position:0%
the research you've done other than that
 
03:32:22.370 --> 03:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
I would like to see it go forward with
 
03:32:30.790 --> 03:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you okay
 
03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify the
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
information we were provided about the
 
03:32:42.710 --> 03:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
EEOC and what what it is that they re
 
03:32:45.889 --> 03:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
that they view as being retaliatory
 
03:32:49.610 --> 03:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
having a respondent have the ability to
 
03:32:52.130 --> 03:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
remove a case
 
03:32:55.010 --> 03:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
without the claimant also having the
 
03:32:57.769 --> 03:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
similar ability no the claimant can have
 
03:32:59.210 --> 03:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
the ability because they have the burden
 
03:33:02.030 --> 03:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
of proof it's it's I think the idea
 
03:33:03.910 --> 03:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
behind it was that they want to prevent
 
03:33:06.769 --> 03:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
discrimination right and the thought is
 
03:33:09.650 --> 03:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
that a company may have the resources to
 
03:33:12.170 --> 03:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
go to court and whatnot but
 
03:33:14.690 --> 03:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
an employee may not necessarily have
 
03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
those same resources to actually be able
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
to to rise to the level of filing in
 
03:33:20.330 --> 03:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
court and hiring an attorney and all
 
03:33:22.969 --> 03:33:22.979 align:start position:0%
that so the the idea of the respondent
 
03:33:24.349 --> 03:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
being able to then take them over to
 
03:33:26.570 --> 03:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
court and then they'd be you know Pro Se
 
03:33:28.849 --> 03:33:28.859 align:start position:0%
over in court
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
was kind of seen as the this human
 
03:33:33.410 --> 03:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
rights is supposed to be providing them
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:40.190 --> 03:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
I guess financially reasonable within
 
03:33:42.530 --> 03:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
their means that a lay person could be
 
03:33:44.330 --> 03:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
able to enter in
 
03:33:46.670 --> 03:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
a case to them but a layperson may not
 
03:33:48.530 --> 03:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily know what to do if something
 
03:33:51.769 --> 03:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
was sent over to the court
 
03:33:53.570 --> 03:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
did you have something rip dealerenzo
 
03:33:56.889 --> 03:33:56.899 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and um
 
03:33:56.899 --> 03:33:58.670 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and um
representative

03:33:58.670 --> 03:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:33:58.680 --> 03:33:59.870 align:start position:0%
representative
um Manos

03:33:59.870 --> 03:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
um Manos
 
03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that one of the reasons
 
03:34:03.540 --> 03:34:05.809 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that one of the reasons
that

03:34:05.809 --> 03:34:05.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:07.490 --> 03:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
there was concern one of the things that
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
they were concerned about you know as a
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee was that with a respondent
 
03:34:14.510 --> 03:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
only having the um
 
03:34:14.520 --> 03:34:16.130 align:start position:0%
only having the um
the right

03:34:16.130 --> 03:34:16.140 align:start position:0%
the right
 
03:34:16.140 --> 03:34:17.389 align:start position:0%
the right
to

03:34:17.389 --> 03:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:34:20.450 --> 03:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
move the case to Superior Court the
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
issue is that there's this backlog of
 
03:34:25.969 --> 03:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
superior court that we know about and
 
03:34:29.210 --> 03:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
doing so the respondent could do it like
 
03:34:32.090 --> 03:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
remove it like at the last minute
 
03:34:33.530 --> 03:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
um and that would delay the whole the
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
whole process so that's one of the
 
03:34:38.269 --> 03:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
things but I think that with this
 
03:34:40.849 --> 03:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
amendment it's almost like a seesaw
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
effect like we're saying that the
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
complainant would have the um the right
 
03:34:48.290 --> 03:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
to to remove it too Superior Court but
 
03:34:52.330 --> 03:34:52.340 align:start position:0%
then after 60 days the
 
03:34:54.349 --> 03:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
respondent would have the right to
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
remove it so it's almost like you know
 
03:34:58.490 --> 03:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
like a seesaw and it would be an I think
 
03:35:01.130 --> 03:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
it would be on balance
 
03:35:02.630 --> 03:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
oh Madam chair
 
03:35:05.929 --> 03:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
yes so I think the reason that the
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
respondent has that
 
03:35:10.490 --> 03:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
sorry the claimant has that right at the
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
180 days is because everybody has to
 
03:35:15.050 --> 03:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
file at the Human Rights Commission you
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
have no choice so if it's if it's this
 
03:35:21.530 --> 03:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
kind of a case that you're bringing
 
03:35:23.210 --> 03:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
um that that has to do with being a
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
member of a protective class you have no
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
choice but to go and start at the Human
 
03:35:31.490 --> 03:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and so for many people
 
03:35:34.010 --> 03:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
where there's a huge amount of
 
03:35:36.530 --> 03:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
complexity to the case
 
03:35:40.130 --> 03:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
um they may choose to retain counsel
 
03:35:44.030 --> 03:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
but they cannot leave until the 180 days
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
is done
 
03:35:48.250 --> 03:35:48.260 align:start position:0%
because they have to file there first
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
and the only and the reason that
 
03:35:56.090 --> 03:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
that the EEOC and others have really not
 
03:35:57.950 --> 03:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
been happy about this and view it as
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
being retaliatory is because it's not
 
03:36:04.090 --> 03:36:04.100 align:start position:0%
that you have a finding of probable
 
03:36:08.210 --> 03:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
cause and then the respondent removes it
 
03:36:10.190 --> 03:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
as an appeal
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
they remove it and it's a noble hearing
 
03:36:16.370 --> 03:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
so it wipes out everything that came
 
03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
before so I put
 
03:36:20.269 --> 03:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
um a news article from Union Leader
 
03:36:23.210 --> 03:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
which Marissa Chase sent over to me I
 
03:36:25.490 --> 03:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
think half a year ago which talked about
 
03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
a case it's it's a it's an example of
 
03:36:31.370 --> 03:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
how this is used so a gentleman at
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
Market Basket he took a a complaint to
 
03:36:36.170 --> 03:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission because he
 
03:36:38.330 --> 03:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
felt he was not being given a full-time
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity at Market Basket and they he
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
claimed that they said look we reserved
 
03:36:47.210 --> 03:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
those for younger people and so it went
 
03:36:48.889 --> 03:36:48.899 align:start position:0%
to the Human Rights Commission and the
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission after two years
 
03:36:55.309 --> 03:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
and seven months said yes indeed we find
 
03:36:57.950 --> 03:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
that this is what we're finding in in
 
03:37:01.370 --> 03:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
favor of the claimant at which time
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
Market Basket removed it to the superior
 
03:37:09.170 --> 03:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
court and but not as an appeal but as a
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
de novo hearing so it was removed
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
without prejudice and basically
 
03:37:16.910 --> 03:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
everything starts again from the very
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
beginning and I think that is why the
 
03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
EEOC and the U.S Supreme Court viewed it
 
03:37:24.530 --> 03:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
as being retaliatory and I think that's
 
03:37:26.809 --> 03:37:26.819 align:start position:0%
why only two states allow it
 
03:37:29.030 --> 03:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank representative
 
03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
McLean for all of his work you know over
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
the work sessions
 
03:37:37.729 --> 03:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
um last summer and continuously up to
 
03:37:39.530 --> 03:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
this point he's been really fabulous he
 
03:37:42.530 --> 03:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
dug in and um wrapped his arms around it
 
03:37:44.750 --> 03:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
and that's we have
 
03:37:47.450 --> 03:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
a bill to Bass thank you thank you very
 
03:37:47.460 --> 03:37:48.410 align:start position:0%
a bill to Bass thank you thank you very
much

03:37:48.410 --> 03:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:37:53.210 --> 03:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
would anybody who's in the audience I
 
03:38:09.670 --> 03:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:12.950 --> 03:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:38:14.690 --> 03:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for the record my name is
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
Dave jube I'm a senior vice president
 
03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
for public policy with the business and
 
03:38:21.410 --> 03:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
industry Association and you'll recall
 
03:38:24.650 --> 03:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
from the hearing that we testified in
 
03:38:28.429 --> 03:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and had a number
 
03:38:34.010 --> 03:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
of attorneys that also testified
 
03:38:36.650 --> 03:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
um opposing the bill and they have both
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
experience representing both claimants
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
and respondents before the Human Rights
 
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
Commission and they had experience in
 
03:38:48.710 --> 03:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
cases before the EEOC I guess my request
 
03:38:52.269 --> 03:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
at this point is to
 
03:38:56.809 --> 03:38:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:00.650 --> 03:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
delay a decision on this until the fall
 
03:39:02.570 --> 03:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking that for a couple of
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
different reasons
 
03:39:06.170 --> 03:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
one in the fall we should have the
 
03:39:07.969 --> 03:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
performance audit I believe that can be
 
03:39:10.190 --> 03:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
completed in the fall and we'll be able
 
03:39:14.150 --> 03:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
to see what that report says we'll also
 
03:39:14.160 --> 03:39:15.290 align:start position:0%
to see what that report says we'll also
have

03:39:15.290 --> 03:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:39:18.050 --> 03:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
three or four months experience with
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
increased staff at the Human Rights
 
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
Commission and we can assess what type
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
03:39:27.410 --> 03:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
hopefully positive impact that is having
 
03:39:31.610 --> 03:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
on the more rapid adjudication of cases
 
03:39:34.969 --> 03:39:34.979 align:start position:0%
but I'd also like you to hear
 
03:39:38.210 --> 03:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
again from the attorneys that were
 
03:39:41.809 --> 03:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
present that have experience because I'm
 
03:39:43.790 --> 03:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't I just want to make sure that
 
03:39:45.849 --> 03:39:45.859 align:start position:0%
all the information you're receiving
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
about the EEOC and how other states deal
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
with this this issue is completely
 
03:39:52.319 --> 03:39:53.870 align:start position:0%
with this this issue is completely
accurate

03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
03:39:56.510 --> 03:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
it could be I'm not an attorney and I
 
03:39:59.210 --> 03:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
don't have experience with this issue
 
03:40:01.309 --> 03:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
from other states
 
03:40:01.319 --> 03:40:03.370 align:start position:0%
from other states
but

03:40:03.370 --> 03:40:03.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:40:06.050 --> 03:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
moving your decision making until the
 
03:40:07.969 --> 03:40:07.979 align:start position:0%
fall which won't impact
 
03:40:10.010 --> 03:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
how this gets reported out from the
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee next session would allow these
 
03:40:16.250 --> 03:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
attorneys to come back in and answer
 
03:40:19.250 --> 03:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee they'd be
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
here now except we're in the middle of
 
03:40:24.229 --> 03:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
summer one is in somewhere in Italy one
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
is somewhere in California in the third
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
I just couldn't get to respond to my
 
03:40:31.929 --> 03:40:31.939 align:start position:0%
email so I'm not sure what her status is
 
03:40:34.910 --> 03:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
but I know the summertime people scatter
 
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:40:39.170 --> 03:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
we understand you'll make a decision
 
03:40:42.110 --> 03:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
eventually it may not be what the Bia
 
03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
would prefer but that's how things go in
 
03:40:46.610 --> 03:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
the legislature but I would at least
 
03:40:49.130 --> 03:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
like to make sure your decision is based
 
03:40:52.610 --> 03:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
on the most current and inaccurate
 
03:40:55.130 --> 03:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
understanding of this issue as it
 
03:40:56.929 --> 03:40:56.939 align:start position:0%
applies in New Hampshire and also around
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
the country and also with the EEOC so
 
03:41:01.849 --> 03:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
that's my request
 
03:41:04.490 --> 03:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
so whatever we decide here today is just
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee kind of our finding
 
03:41:10.130 --> 03:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
but the entire committee the body of 20
 
03:41:13.070 --> 03:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
would still have to to vote on what they
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to do with the bill before it
 
03:41:17.389 --> 03:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
went on to the house to move forward
 
03:41:19.550 --> 03:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
my only thing is I think we had
 
03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
originally opened this up because we
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
were very concerned about performance
 
03:41:25.010 --> 03:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
and whatnot but it seems like
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns
 
03:41:30.530 --> 03:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
have been addressed and I think that
 
03:41:33.229 --> 03:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
that's something if the audit committee
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
were to find something another bill
 
03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
could be certainly opened up to address
 
03:41:38.450 --> 03:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
something related to that but I'm not
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure that it would change
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
how we would proceed with this and I
 
03:41:46.490 --> 03:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
don't I I hate to put you on the spot uh
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
would you be able to look for us and see
 
03:41:53.210 --> 03:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
if that is accurate information about
 
03:41:55.610 --> 03:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
the EEOC and US kind of being
 
03:41:57.889 --> 03:41:57.899 align:start position:0%
one of two states that that only allow
 
03:41:59.090 --> 03:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
that is that something I don't know if
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:15.479 --> 03:42:17.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:42:17.269 --> 03:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:17.279 --> 03:42:18.410 align:start position:0%
okay
it

03:42:18.410 --> 03:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:42:22.429 --> 03:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
okay and if I could respond
 
03:42:25.370 --> 03:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this for a long time in
 
03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
the recommendation from this
 
03:42:27.239 --> 03:42:28.729 align:start position:0%
the recommendation from this
subcommittee

03:42:28.729 --> 03:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:42:31.370 --> 03:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
will be critical in how the full
 
03:42:33.650 --> 03:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
committee looks on this issue
 
03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
and so it's important to me that the
 
03:42:39.769 --> 03:42:39.779 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has all the information
 
03:42:41.929 --> 03:42:41.939 align:start position:0%
available so that they can make the
 
03:42:43.610 --> 03:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
right decision and what they believe is
 
03:42:45.650 --> 03:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do on this bill so
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
again I would ask
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you resist the
 
03:42:53.210 --> 03:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
temptation to make a decision today and
 
03:42:55.490 --> 03:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
if you could come back as a subcommittee
 
03:42:59.170 --> 03:42:59.180 align:start position:0%
in the early fall in in hold
 
03:43:01.670 --> 03:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
not a public hearing but a work session
 
03:43:04.550 --> 03:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
to allow some more input that would
 
03:43:05.690 --> 03:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
still give
 
03:43:08.090 --> 03:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
the full committee plenty of time to
 
03:43:10.250 --> 03:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
hear your recommendation and consider it
 
03:43:13.370 --> 03:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
before the reporting deadline comes up
 
03:43:16.010 --> 03:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay we'll definitely take that under
 
03:43:16.020 --> 03:43:17.210 align:start position:0%
okay we'll definitely take that under
consideration

03:43:17.210 --> 03:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:43:17.220 --> 03:43:17.929 align:start position:0%
consideration
um

03:43:17.929 --> 03:43:17.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:19.790 --> 03:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for for taking the time to
 
03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.290 --> 03:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
do you mind just repeating that in the
 
03:43:43.969 --> 03:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
mic Sam while she hands those out just
 
03:43:46.969 --> 03:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
so that those listening know
 
03:43:46.979 --> 03:43:55.910 align:start position:0%
so that those listening know
absolutely

03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:03.130 --> 03:44:03.140 align:start position:0%
oh can you say that one more time
 
03:44:05.750 --> 03:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have Marissa Chase here the executive
 
03:44:06.650 --> 03:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
Association for justice I'm Samantha
 
03:44:10.969 --> 03:44:10.979 align:start position:0%
hearing I am a board member of the New
 
03:44:12.769 --> 03:44:12.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for justice and an
 
03:44:15.710 --> 03:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
attorney at Douglas Leonard and Garvey
 
03:44:18.170 --> 03:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
so what I just passed around today and
 
03:44:20.210 --> 03:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you all for taking the time I know
 
03:44:23.030 --> 03:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is representative Delorenzo and my
 
03:44:24.830 --> 03:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
second summer in a row getting to talk
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
about all this
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I learned a lot today at the Human
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission this is a complicated
 
03:44:29.880 --> 03:44:31.010 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission this is a complicated
issue

03:44:31.010 --> 03:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of always been our
 
03:44:35.150 --> 03:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
struggle as our organization that wanted
 
03:44:37.729 --> 03:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
to pass Senate Bill 296 and then House
 
03:44:39.650 --> 03:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
Bill 362 is
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
for us it's a really simple little thing
 
03:44:44.269 --> 03:44:44.279 align:start position:0%
I mean we have data from the New

which is in your packet
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
um in response to a 91a request of
 
03:44:53.750 --> 03:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
October 5th 2021 that shows
 
03:44:56.030 --> 03:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
when a response a respondent removal

um

03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
post a probable cause finding which is
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
again the standard of there could
 
03:45:05.929 --> 03:45:05.939 align:start position:0%
potentially be discrimination here right
 
03:45:08.450 --> 03:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's not supposed to be you know
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
adjudication judge jury
 
03:45:14.450 --> 03:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
um let's see in 2015 there were 13
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's high we heard today for 2022
 
03:45:20.229 --> 03:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
there were 22 cases but on average
 
03:45:23.210 --> 03:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
2016 the respondent removed its sick
 
03:45:25.969 --> 03:45:25.979 align:start position:0%
removed six cases after a probable cause
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
finding to Superior Court 2017 1 2018 7
 
03:45:34.670 --> 03:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
2019 7 2023 2021.5
 
03:45:37.969 --> 03:45:37.979 align:start position:0%
this is not a large number of cases that
 
03:45:40.490 --> 03:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
are being removed by respondents to
 
03:45:42.769 --> 03:45:42.779 align:start position:0%
Superior Court where a claimant then has
 
03:45:45.110 --> 03:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
to start all over again and more likely
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
than not hire an attorney or not pursue
 
03:45:48.290 --> 03:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
their case
 
03:45:50.750 --> 03:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
but to those people it matters a great
 
03:45:53.150 --> 03:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
deal to those people that have to start
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission that go
 
03:45:56.530 --> 03:45:56.540 align:start position:0%
through that whole process for years
 
03:45:59.210 --> 03:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
waiting a decision and then to have a
 
03:46:00.710 --> 03:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
game start over
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
that affects them
 
03:46:04.610 --> 03:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
so while you know we got into these
 
03:46:05.870 --> 03:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
other issues of peeking under the hood
 
03:46:07.790 --> 03:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
at the Human Rights Commission why
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
things are taking so long because of
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that you all heard in testimony
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
from you know both lawyers on both sides
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
of the employment scale
 
03:46:18.239 --> 03:46:19.250 align:start position:0%
of the employment scale
um

03:46:19.250 --> 03:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:22.130 --> 03:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
you know the resource allocation
 
03:46:23.990 --> 03:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that that is all moving along
 
03:46:26.450 --> 03:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
and I thank you all for increasing their
 
03:46:27.769 --> 03:46:27.779 align:start position:0%
resources for the Human Rights
 
03:46:29.870 --> 03:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
Commission in the budget and so glad for
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative McLean's advocacy and the
 
03:46:32.990 --> 03:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
performance audit review I think that'll
 
03:46:35.330 --> 03:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
be fascinating I think that will inform
 
03:46:37.969 --> 03:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
as representative qatab said other
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
potential policy decisions
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't really impact five cases a year
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know as we saw today the Human
 
03:46:47.330 --> 03:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission can absorb about five
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
cases a year it could absorb 22 cases a
 
03:46:51.120 --> 03:46:52.490 align:start position:0%
cases a year it could absorb 22 cases a
year

03:46:52.490 --> 03:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:46:54.410 --> 03:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
um that really doesn't have anything to
 
03:46:56.809 --> 03:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
do with delaying this to see how more
 
03:46:59.690 --> 03:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
investigators are working out or more or
 
03:47:02.150 --> 03:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
what the performance audit review says
 
03:47:05.450 --> 03:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
I see them as very separate and this is
 
03:47:07.969 --> 03:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
something that um the simple fairness
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
issue not a resource allocation issue
 
03:47:14.570 --> 03:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.150 --> 03:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
I would Echo essentially everything that
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
Marissa just said I would also add on a
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
little bit those few cases a year that
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
are being removed by respondents to
 
03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
Superior Court after probable cause
 
03:47:28.969 --> 03:47:28.979 align:start position:0%
finding it looks like this for employees
 
03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
they are a waitress or a busboy or a
 
03:47:37.309 --> 03:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
Target employee making minimum wage and
 
03:47:39.769 --> 03:47:39.779 align:start position:0%
they are sexually harassed they complain
 
03:47:42.290 --> 03:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
instead they get fired so they pursue a
 
03:47:43.849 --> 03:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
charge at the Human Rights Commission
 
03:47:47.330 --> 03:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
they have very low wages maybe they've
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
only lost you know a total of 750 by the
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
time they find an attorney
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
when they call me and ask if I can
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
represent them in court I'm
 
03:47:57.050 --> 03:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
unfortunately going to have to say no
 
03:48:00.229 --> 03:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
because I am paid on a contingency fee
 
03:48:02.330 --> 03:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
basis because employees like that cannot
 
03:48:04.670 --> 03:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
afford to pay hourly I can't afford to
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
work for three for free because I have
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
to keep the lights on and so I do a
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
contingency which means whatever I get
 
03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
for you I take a percentage of at the
 
03:48:13.910 --> 03:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
end but I defer all of my compensation
 
03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
until the very end
 
03:48:17.389 --> 03:48:17.399 align:start position:0%
the compensation is determined by lost
 
03:48:17.399 --> 03:48:18.530 align:start position:0%
the compensation is determined by lost
wages

03:48:18.530 --> 03:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
wages
 
03:48:20.570 --> 03:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
which means there's no money for me to
 
03:48:22.610 --> 03:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
to be paid for my time at the end so
 
03:48:24.410 --> 03:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
people like that will not be able to get
 
03:48:26.690 --> 03:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
an attorney they'll have to navigate a
 
03:48:29.690 --> 03:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
complex court system and litigation on
 
03:48:31.250 --> 03:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
their own and most people are just not
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
equipped for that
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
um I would just briefly notice well that
 
03:48:38.510 --> 03:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know we've heard from attorneys who
 
03:48:39.950 --> 03:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
um on a variety of occasions and one
 
03:48:44.690 --> 03:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
recurring theme that I keep hearing is
 
03:48:46.130 --> 03:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
what about the employer's right to a
 
03:48:49.010 --> 03:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
jury trial there is no right there is no
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to a jury trial the
 
03:48:53.090 --> 03:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
only for the employer for the employer
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
yes the only constitutional right to a
 
03:48:57.530 --> 03:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
jury trial that exists are those rights
 
03:48:59.750 --> 03:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
that were in existence at the time our
 
03:49:01.610 --> 03:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
state constitution was passed in I
 
03:49:03.769 --> 03:49:03.779 align:start position:0%
believe 1794.
 
03:49:03.779 --> 03:49:04.429 align:start position:0%
believe 1794.
um

03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:06.769 --> 03:49:06.779 align:start position:0%
and 354a didn't come into existence
 
03:49:09.469 --> 03:49:09.479 align:start position:0%
until the 60s so that's that's not an
 
03:49:11.450 --> 03:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
issue here and representative McLean
 
03:49:12.889 --> 03:49:12.899 align:start position:0%
covered it well so I won't cover here
 
03:49:14.990 --> 03:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
long but the choice of forum belongs to
 
03:49:16.610 --> 03:49:16.620 align:start position:0%
the person who Bears the burden of proof
 
03:49:18.590 --> 03:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
that is a principle of law that runs
 
03:49:20.690 --> 03:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
through our our state system and
 
03:49:20.700 --> 03:49:22.250 align:start position:0%
through our our state system and
federally

03:49:22.250 --> 03:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
federally
 
03:49:22.260 --> 03:49:23.389 align:start position:0%
federally
um

03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:25.849 --> 03:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
and I would also
 
03:49:25.859 --> 03:49:26.510 align:start position:0%
and I would also
um

03:49:26.510 --> 03:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:28.849 --> 03:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
welcome data on whether or not it is
 
03:49:29.990 --> 03:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
correct the New Hampshire and Rhode
 
03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
Island are the only states that allow
 
03:49:32.990 --> 03:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
the respondent to remove New England
 
03:49:34.610 --> 03:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
states the only New England states
 
03:49:35.929 --> 03:49:35.939 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:49:35.939 --> 03:49:36.590 align:start position:0%
excuse me
um

03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
it Bears noting how it how respondent
 
03:49:41.090 --> 03:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
removal even got into our statute my
 
03:49:43.190 --> 03:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is that when 354a was
 
03:49:44.690 --> 03:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
being passed we were looking to a
 
03:49:45.889 --> 03:49:45.899 align:start position:0%
constitutional challenge that was
 
03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
ongoing in Massachusetts and we were
 
03:49:50.809 --> 03:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
nervous about somebody raising a similar
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional challenge here and so we
 
03:49:54.050 --> 03:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
put the respondent right of removal into
 
03:49:55.969 --> 03:49:55.979 align:start position:0%
the bill essentially as a peace offering
 
03:49:58.010 --> 03:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
to get it passed to move on
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it never even made it into
 
03:50:03.050 --> 03:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
their bill it never the respondent
 
03:50:04.849 --> 03:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
didn't end up having a right to remove
 
03:50:06.410 --> 03:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
over there so it ended up being a
 
03:50:06.420 --> 03:50:07.849 align:start position:0%
over there so it ended up being a
non-issue

03:50:07.849 --> 03:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
non-issue
 
03:50:07.859 --> 03:50:08.450 align:start position:0%
non-issue
um

03:50:08.450 --> 03:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that the EEOC May view
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
a respondent's right to remove as
 
03:50:14.090 --> 03:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
retaliatory I have to say I agree and
 
03:50:15.650 --> 03:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's why I've been here at every
 
03:50:17.330 --> 03:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
session that I've been able to to come
 
03:50:19.910 --> 03:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
to and sit in front of you folks
 
03:50:19.920 --> 03:50:20.630 align:start position:0%
to and sit in front of you folks
um

03:50:20.630 --> 03:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
there is no legitimate reason for the
 
03:50:25.790 --> 03:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
respondent to remove to court none
 
03:50:28.130 --> 03:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
I can't stress that enough I can't even
 
03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
come up with a hypothetical reason that
 
03:50:31.250 --> 03:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
would be legitimate
 
03:50:31.260 --> 03:50:32.630 align:start position:0%
would be legitimate
um

03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
and so with all of that said I think
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for now happy to field
 
03:50:37.490 --> 03:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
if anybody on the committee have any
 
03:50:41.330 --> 03:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
questions for uh
 
03:50:44.510 --> 03:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
for for either Mrs Miss Chase or or Miss
 
03:50:44.520 --> 03:50:46.849 align:start position:0%
for for either Mrs Miss Chase or or Miss
hard

03:50:46.849 --> 03:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:49.010 --> 03:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
um attorney choice I wanted to ask it
 
03:50:52.610 --> 03:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter whether
 
03:50:52.620 --> 03:50:53.690 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter whether
um

03:50:53.690 --> 03:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:55.610 --> 03:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Rhode Island are the
 
03:50:57.710 --> 03:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
only two New England states because if
 
03:51:02.090 --> 03:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
if the EEOC views removal as retaliation
 
03:51:05.210 --> 03:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
that's a national policy so I'm just
 
03:51:06.650 --> 03:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
curious about
 
03:51:08.570 --> 03:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
why you would be curious about what
 
03:51:13.130 --> 03:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
other states allow respondent removal
 
03:51:13.140 --> 03:51:14.150 align:start position:0%
other states allow respondent removal
um

03:51:14.150 --> 03:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:16.670 --> 03:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of
 
03:51:16.680 --> 03:51:17.389 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of
um

03:51:17.389 --> 03:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:20.269 --> 03:51:20.279 align:start position:0%
always telling the truth that's it I
 
03:51:21.889 --> 03:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify the truth for the
 
03:51:23.570 --> 03:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
record speaking of which I am not an
 
03:51:25.550 --> 03:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
attorney but I work for them but thank
 
03:51:25.560 --> 03:51:26.450 align:start position:0%
attorney but I work for them but thank
you

03:51:26.450 --> 03:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:51:26.460 --> 03:51:27.349 align:start position:0%
you
um

03:51:27.349 --> 03:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
no I just I and again that was not a
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
fact we brought up that was what Sarah
 
03:51:33.650 --> 03:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
Burke Holland um at the Human Rights
 
03:51:35.570 --> 03:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
Commission said and I just wanted to
 
03:51:37.010 --> 03:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that nobody was operating
 
03:51:39.410 --> 03:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
under any false assumption but I totally
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
agree with you it doesn't matter if we
 
03:51:42.239 --> 03:51:43.030 align:start position:0%
agree with you it doesn't matter if we
are

03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:51:46.729 --> 03:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
1049 or one of two if the EOC views it
 
03:51:48.290 --> 03:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
as retaliatory
 
03:51:50.210 --> 03:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
and we would agree
 
03:51:54.410 --> 03:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody else on the committee have
 
03:52:00.290 --> 03:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.570 --> 03:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:05.389 --> 03:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so I guess what I'd like
 
03:52:07.070 --> 03:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
to hear is
 
03:52:08.750 --> 03:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
where is everybody at I don't mean I
 
03:52:08.760 --> 03:52:11.030 align:start position:0%
where is everybody at I don't mean I
don't

03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:14.090 --> 03:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
I don't personally seeing my position on
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
this changing but I'm happy to you know
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
if there's no harm in us coming back in
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
September and just doing another quick
 
03:52:22.490 --> 03:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
session just to to vote on it but I'd
 
03:52:24.110 --> 03:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
like to just where's it where's
 
03:52:25.610 --> 03:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
everybody's kind of head at with this
 
03:52:26.929 --> 03:52:26.939 align:start position:0%
with everybody how does everybody else
 
03:52:26.939 --> 03:52:29.650 align:start position:0%
with everybody how does everybody else
feel

03:52:29.650 --> 03:52:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
I mean that's I mean that's my feeling
 
03:52:33.889 --> 03:52:33.899 align:start position:0%
we don't need to make any decision
 
03:52:37.010 --> 03:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
decision today I mean the uh
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
I mean they gave a good accounting
 
03:52:42.469 --> 03:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
themselves as a institution seems to be
 
03:52:44.269 --> 03:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
functioning more or less as intended
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
although it is they are
 
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
expanding their staff which will make
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
them get to the cases quicker and uh
 
03:52:53.870 --> 03:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
03:52:56.330 --> 03:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
and they do go to Great Lengths to try
 
03:52:59.530 --> 03:52:59.540 align:start position:0%
to uh the immediate mediation
 
03:53:02.269 --> 03:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
in early steps in process have concealed
 
03:53:03.769 --> 03:53:03.779 align:start position:0%
they can also have a conciliation which
 
03:53:06.530 --> 03:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
is forced mediation before so
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
and as I said the number we did hear
 
03:53:10.429 --> 03:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
about the low number of public hearings
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
pretend that that's basically kind of
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
the way
 
03:53:16.610 --> 03:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
the process was designed to work the uh
 
03:53:22.490 --> 03:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:28.670 --> 03:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.849 --> 03:53:30.859 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
as far as making a decision today
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
I don't feel we have to because the
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
hearing I was in this morning
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
they're saying we didn't have to do
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
anything until
 
03:53:47.809 --> 03:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
September October because it won't come
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
up until November so we have plenty of
 
03:53:54.170 --> 03:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
time and I would really like to see what
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
the audit brings us
 
03:53:58.269 --> 03:53:58.279 align:start position:0%
and see if we can get some information
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
another couple of months it's just how
 
03:54:02.040 --> 03:54:04.070 align:start position:0%
another couple of months it's just how
fast

03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
fast
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
the commission is coming forward with
 
03:54:07.969 --> 03:54:07.979 align:start position:0%
these cases
 
03:54:11.450 --> 03:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
so that see it makes a difference
 
03:54:13.010 --> 03:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
I agree with that and actually just
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
reflecting kind of on what you mentioned
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
I guess I would say that typically that
 
03:54:19.130 --> 03:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
the period to enter in a new LSR is
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
September but if there's a subcommittee
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
then the subcommittee kind of has until
 
03:54:25.610 --> 03:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
November to make a decision and so for
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
that reason if something did come out of
 
03:54:30.170 --> 03:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
the legislative Autumn that was I guess
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
after September but before November then
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
we would kind of have that period where
 
03:54:36.530 --> 03:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
we could potentially put something else
 
03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
in if needed so if
 
03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
I guess if everybody's okay with that we
 
03:54:44.450 --> 03:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
could you know reconvene you know in
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
September and kind of see where
 
03:54:47.929 --> 03:54:47.939 align:start position:0%
everybody's at is that okay with your
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
reptiles right thank you yeah I'm I'm
 
03:54:52.010 --> 03:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
fine with that
 
03:54:54.050 --> 03:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you all for for
 
03:54:56.150 --> 03:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
coming out I really appreciate it and we
 
03:54:58.429 --> 03:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
look forward to meeting again in
 
03:54:58.439 --> 03:54:59.570 align:start position:0%
look forward to meeting again in
September

03:54:59.570 --> 03:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
September
 
03:55:03.050 --> 03:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:05.389 --> 03:55:05.399 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna close the hearing it is now 1
