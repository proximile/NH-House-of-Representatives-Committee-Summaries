and the
 
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
those bills are
 
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to have caitlin right now
 
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
would you please introduce the bill so
 
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 align:start position:0%
we can get on with it and then i'll
 
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
explain where we're going
 
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh ralph baum hill vote does it 20 town
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
litchfield i'm here to introduce house
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill 1626 relative to the unique pupil
 
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
identification system and we have
 
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
somebody here from the d.o.e to further
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
tell us about it thank you very much
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh caitlin davis caitlin has to be out
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
of here by 9 30.
 
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
so uh we can utilize time to ask all the
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
questions we want relative to the first
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
hello good all right great thank you um
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
for the first bill for 1626 um i'm
 
00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
actually going to talk generally about
 
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
both bills and kind of how they align to
 
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
each other so for the first bill for
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
1626 when we begin implementing the
 
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
education freedom account program this
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
summer slash this fall
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
we determined that the best way of doing
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
that work would be using the assassin
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
numbers to track those students so state
 
00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.510 align:start position:0%
numbers to track those students so state
adopt

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
the state assigned student identifier
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
so we currently have a system that we
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
multiple systems that rely across the
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
entire department of education on use of
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
sas numbers we have robust systems of
 
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
controls built around this asset numbers
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure the accuracy of reporting and
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
data and
 
00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
most importantly the payment of adequacy
 
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.350 align:start position:0%
most importantly the payment of adequacy
so

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
when we begin to build out the efa
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
program this fall
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
this asset number was is definitely the
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
best way of doing that
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
we reached out to representative
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
cordelli as he's kind of the champion of
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
education freedoms accounts to ask him
 
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.790 align:start position:0%
education freedoms accounts to ask him
to

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor this bill on behalf of the
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
department to expand identifier to
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
include efa kids and we were i was very
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
pleased um this fall when we started
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
reviewing the legislation to see a very
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
similar bill on behalf of the democratic
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
majority or with generic natori
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
represent reps on it um that so the
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
bill's sort of aligned or both i think
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
wanting to do the same thing
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
now the purpose of the bill is for every
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
single student that's receiving adequacy
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
including those receiving charter school
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy or an efa payment to have a
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
unique student identifier number so the
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
department of education can do its
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
absolute best to ensure that there's no
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
double payments
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
right now our system works so that we
 
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.029 align:start position:0%
right now our system works so that we
have

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
we use a unique student identifier and
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
track the kids around the system
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
we do it at a rate of right down to the
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
half day of attendance so if a child
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
were to attend a concord school district
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
in the morning and then get an efa in
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
the afternoon or hopkinton in the
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
afternoon our
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
our measurement is that accurate
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the year we use assassin
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
number to calculate the average daily
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
membership which that the payment is
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
reliant on that
 
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.790 align:start position:0%
reliant on that
so

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.749 align:start position:0%
so
we

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
wrote the language to include the
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
assassin numbers for the efa children
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
at the exact same time when we were
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
writing that language i did happen to
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
notice that the current law does not
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
include charter schools although that
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
has been the current practice at the
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
department of education to give
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
assassin number to a charter school kid
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the last 15 years um so i thought
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
this was a good opportunity for us to
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
add that
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
so that's why you will see this in the
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
1626 version of the bill and can very
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
easily be added into the 1649 part of
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
the bill i'm sure it just wasn't
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
something that was thought of by the
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
drafting attorneys because
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't necessarily realize that
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
that was also a need
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
as far as any anything else in the bill
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
that could be slightly different
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
um so there are or talks about the
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
director of the scholarship organization
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
for efas i think we can just rely on the
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization in general
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
because throughout the bill it talks
 
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.749 align:start position:0%
because throughout the bill it talks
about

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
it talks about school districts and
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
early childhood programs
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then throughout we added where it
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
talks about superintendents or designees
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
we also added scholarship organizations
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
or designee throughout that
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
the other area that i noticed that there
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
is a little bit of a difference is we're
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the information that's
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
maintained in the data warehouse at the
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
department of education so in 1649
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
line 15 it gives access to the data
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
warehouse to the legislative budget
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
office and the attorney general's office
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that that ability is already
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
through their overall existence and the
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
work of the department of education they
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
already have that access so i'm not sure
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
that the bill specifically needs to
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
include that information
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
um because they already have info access
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
to confidential information throughout
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
the state just through their existence
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
um so that is
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
really the bill why we've asked for the
 
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.350 align:start position:0%
really the bill why we've asked for the
bill

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll take any questions on sas
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
numbers or how this might affect either
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
or any of the programs
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much caitlyn are there
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent cornell
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you caitlyn um we're on
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
the first bill 1626 on the um i guess
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's the first page on line 26
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization director or
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
designee now we know when it's a
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent or a chartered public
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
school the designee is usually the
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
assistant principal human resources
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
how do we know who the scholarship
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
organization director's designee will be
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
um so they will still have an account in
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
the in our
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
we call it the nhdoe single sign-on
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
system and it's a specific account so we
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
don't have it doesn't say children's
 
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship foundation account it says
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
kate baker or matt southerton at the
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization um or it says
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know superintendent murphy at the
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
concord school district um so it is a
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable account so we
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
could see who is entering that data and
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
putting that information in
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
but if they use a designee how do we
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
know who that person is the designee
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
should have so even though they're using
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
a designee the designee would have their
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and thank
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
you very much ms davis for joining us
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
this morning so
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
um taking a hypothetical let's say
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
you've got um um
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
a little stevie woodside that um that is
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
attending a public school in in his town
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then later becomes homeschooled
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then later than that
 
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.069 align:start position:0%
and then later than that
um

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
let's say
uh

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know opens an efa
 
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.470 align:start position:0%
you know opens an efa
account

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
what what sort of information would
 
00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:22.790 align:start position:0%
what what sort of information would
and

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
what sort i guess what what sort of
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
information would the doe have
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
associated with uh with that student of
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
course so um this is just a hypothetical
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so for assassin numbers right
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
now we maintain first name last name
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
date of birth
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
and town of residence
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
and if the child is in a public school
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
or a public program that requires data
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
being entered on a student identifiable
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
level any data that's associated with
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
that the doe systems do not store sassed
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
numbers with name anywhere so if you
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
look in the doe system all you see is
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
sas number one two three four five
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
you'll never see that stevie whatever
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
her last name
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
his results are x y and z so you
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to kind of include that
 
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.230 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to kind of include that
information

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
so various information is tied to that
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
sas number including assessment results
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
subgroup information and it's how we
 
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.310 align:start position:0%
subgroup information and it's how we
generate

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
generate
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
to do for state and federal law um it
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
things like determining the average
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
daily membership for paying adequacy it
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
would be we would also know that cv is
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
free to reduce lunch so we would know
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
that he's we're going to pay that school
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
district for free and reduced lunch
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
now the department of education the way
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
it works right now is for public schools
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
we have a count twice a year we have a
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
count on october 1st and at the end of
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
the school year
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
and so at the boi the october 1st count
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
a school district enters that there's a
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
child the assassin number and if the
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
child was in the school district last
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
year it's just a continuation or if the
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
kid is new there's things that we call
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
entry and withdrawal codes and it would
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
say you know where the kid came from so
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
the kid came from
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
massachusetts public school we have no
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
information but if the kid came from
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
another school district information
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
would follow them
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
and we would be able to link them back
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
over there now schools are required for
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
the purpose of reporting things like
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and dropout rates to
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
have continuity of sas numbers meaning
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
we need to track them all over the state
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
so when a child leaves a school a public
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
school or an efa program now or charter
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
school is responsible for reporting to
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
the department of education where that
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
kid went so if the kid said if they said
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
that the kid went to another public
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
school in the state of new hampshire and
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
then we don't see a record for that in
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
another public school using that same
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
asset number we will work with the
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
school to say that kidnap did not show
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
up when you really need to track that
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
kid find over there and a lot of times
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
oh no they went to it they actually went
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
to a private school or they moved out of
 
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.269 align:start position:0%
to a private school or they moved out of
state

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
in your instance so we would have an
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
entry code from when the kid enrolled
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
say in kindergarten kid leaves in second
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
grade we would have an exit code exit to
 
00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
grade we would have an exit code exit to
homeschool

00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
homeschool
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then now the child is accessing an
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
efa there will be a re-entry code that
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization will use
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the scholarship organization is is
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
to the best of their ability ensuring
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
continuity of sas numbers um so we will
 
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
continuity of sas numbers um so we will
have

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
the number um
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
and that same number will be used
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
throughout them and that's how when we
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
are looking at the phase out grants or
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking at when we had questions i
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
believe it was last week about how many
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
kids were in public schools with efa
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
that's how we were able to do that
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
because we were able to take the list of
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
sas numbers that the efa
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
program has reported to us and look back
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
in our system for the past 10 years and
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
say this acid number appeared at any
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
given time in a public school or or this
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
asset number is brand new and it's never
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
appeared in a public school before
 
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.670 align:start position:0%
appeared in a public school before
so

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
representative allison
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair hi caitlin
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the past as i remember and it's
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
getting further and further away uh
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
height we were having some trouble in
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
finding those particularly high school
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
students who left and went somewhere
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
and and i don't know whether
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
it was the receiving school wasn't
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
reporting or what but there was always a
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
cadre that sometimes grew pretty large
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
of kids that were in limbo they had left
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
i mean it was clear they'd left
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
and but there was not clear
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
whether they showed up anywhere
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
particularly in other than new hampshire
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
school is that still an issue i mean it
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
could certainly be an issue so our
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
systems right now um are set up to
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
to reduce duplication um so if
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
art ellison were to leave concord high
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
school and then an art ellison would
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
show up and conquer in
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
hopkinton high school with the same date
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
of birth and name we would say our
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
system would automatically say are you
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
sure it's not that same person and then
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
it would help the schools work together
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
the system also shows a report to both
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
concord and to hopkinton saying hey
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know this person looks the same are
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
you sure it's not the same so that
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
matching is included but there's always
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
that risk that a child leaves
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
and then is not picked up someplace else
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
and in which case the school
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
as you
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
well know this the school would be
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
would have to count that kid as a
 
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.590 align:start position:0%
would have to count that kid as a
dropout

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
dropout
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
so and that's how our dropout reporting
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
works is if if the child is not picked
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
up and there's no graduation record we
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
assume that child is a dropout thank you
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
i i've got a question
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
is there any tracking of of the
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
homeschooling youngsters uh in terms of
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
the unique uh people identifiers so the
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
only reason we would have information on
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
a child participating in a homeschool
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
program is if a child is now receiving
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
an efa or participating in a class is
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
class at their public school
 
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.350 align:start position:0%
class at their public school
so

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
we there is a small set aside and
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy for public schools that are
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
offering classes to homeschool kids at
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
the high school level so if if a kid
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
takes say calculus at their high school
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
a homeschool kid they would have a sasa
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
number and they would
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
report that information back to the
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
department of education for us to be
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
able to make that adequacy payment but
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
other than that there's no tracking for
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
assassin numbers for home school
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
children how then do we determine the
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
adm are
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of kids which are in the
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
district but not in attendance but doing
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
the homeschooling thing the admr that we
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
report does not include homeschool or
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
non-public school children it only
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
reports only includes kids that are in
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
public public school or charter schools
 
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.150 align:start position:0%
public public school or charter schools
or

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
and we may or we're looking at
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
potentially including the efa kids in
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
those reports going forward we actually
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
had a conversation about it yesterday as
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
far as reporting and and private schools
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
if they're a tuition to from a by a
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
local board to a private school
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so if it's a special education
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
child if it's childhood is just a
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
regular student if it's a regular
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
student and it's b the tuition is being
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
paid by a public school that kid still
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
shows up as a public school child so
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a croydon situation
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
is that well that's exactly right yes
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
yes so that those would because those
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
are still counted as public school kids
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
the state is still paying adequacy on
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
behalf of those kids and so we would
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
have that information for those ones but
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
for a kid that just is enrolled right in
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
bishop brady high school by their parent
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
and not participating in an efa we do
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
not have any information other than
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
bishop brady has reported that there's
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
11 11th graders
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh i i think
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock had his hand up first
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning how you
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
doing hello good good i just i
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
i think i want to make sure i understood
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
what you said previously you're talking
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
about assassin numbers which i have some
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
familiarity with
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
but the charter schools you said they
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
have no assassin numbers i want to show
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
you the right no assassin numbers
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
attached no charter schools do have sas
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
and numbers attached the law does not
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
specify that charter schools should be
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
using sas numbers as well although the
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
department has implemented that for more
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
than 15 years now so i just wanted when
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
writing the law for representative
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli to add in the scholarship
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
organizations i was like oh shoot we
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
should probably include charter schools
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
too and we put charter schools in but
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's working that way right now it won't
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
recreate any other work because it's the
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
exact same thing we don't want to double
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
pay for a child that is enrolled in a
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
charter school and a district school or
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
potentially an efa so that's how we
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
track all of that information
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you yes
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you just to follow up
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
good i didn't understand that but thank
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
you i do now it's much clearer uh in
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
terms of academic assessments any of
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
those scores the chart scores do charter
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
schools report that at all through the
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
assassin numbers yes okay so charter
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
schools assess in the same way that
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
district public schools do
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so what they do is they all public
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
schools for the purpose of participating
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
in the state assessment do something
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
called an aoy in any time of the year
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
entry and that you is used to roster the
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
kids we then provide the roster to the
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
assessment company and the assessment
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
company then will provide us
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
scores back for the rosters of the kids
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
that we're supposed to assess and that's
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
how we track the kids that did assess
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
versus the kids that were supposed to
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
assess and the appropriate grade that
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're assessing in in in their levels
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
and that's how we do all of our data
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
reporting well thank you so much thank
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome uh representative
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
thank thanks again um uh caitlin thank
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
you very much mr chair so um you i think
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned bishop brady yes so
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm i i was just wondering if you
 
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.350 align:start position:0%
so i'm i i was just wondering if you
could

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i followed that i was
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk about how
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
sas it applies um let's say in a
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
situation or in a first student that
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
attends bishop brady for student that
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
attends st paul's school and for a
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
student that goes to
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
let's say pinkerton academy of course so
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
pinkerton academy assuming that the
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
child is a resident of dairy and derry
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
is actually or one of the surrounding
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
towns that tuitions to pinkerton we do
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
have student identifiable information
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
for those children that is because those
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
kids are receiving adequacy they are
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
technically public school kids as far as
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
our systems and whatnot
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
um if
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
you were to just tuition your child into
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
pinkerton and call them a private school
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
kid a kid from concord that doesn't have
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
a tuition agreement they would that kid
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
would not we would not necessarily have
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
any asset information on that child
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
as far as saint paul's and bishop brady
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
we do not collect any personal
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
identifiable information on those
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
students um unless the child is
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
participating in an efa so we do not
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
have total information so if we know
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
there's so
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
let me go back the thing that non-public
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
schools are required to do is report
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
once a year to us their enrollment by
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
grade so if you look on the department
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
of education website we have reports
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
that talk about non-public schools and
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
their enrollment by grade but what we
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
don't know is in that enrollment by
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
grade if there's 11 11th graders at
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
bishop brady how many of those kids
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
potentially are an efa child versus a
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
parent paid child but what we do do know
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
on from on our side of things is if the
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
kid is a sa is participating in the efa
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
we have paid for that child so they
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
could be included in that double account
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
right now we are not receiving
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
information from the scholarship
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
organization as far as where the child
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
is participating or even if the child is
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
in in public non-public school or not so
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have a way of kind of netting
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
that out of that number
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
i i have another now follow-up question
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
here uh n193e3
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement for a data
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
collection regarding the delivery of an
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
adequate education with these indicators
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
which way attendance suspension
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
expulsion yes uh attendance and cte
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
programs i always mentioned cte uh uh
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
those and ap courses those going on in
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
the military et cetera et cetera
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
is the unique people identifier reflect
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
that information we can get it in the
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
aggregate i'm not concerned about the
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
individual student but i
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
is this how that's being reported and
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
gathered yes we we use assassin number
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
for virtually everything that we're
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
reporting it's our main thing that we
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
use to collect and aggregate our data at
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
the department of education and validate
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
our data because without the unique
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
identifier or or any sort of unique um
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
data collection we would not be able to
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh validate that a kid might not be
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
included in multiple subgroups or
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
multiple schools
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that is our we have a lot of
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
validation built into assassin numbers
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
and so we do have for those college and
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
career readiness indicators we have a
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
report that says that caitlyn davis
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
participated in the sat took the as fab
 
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.789 align:start position:0%
participated in the sat took the as fab
and

00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
achieved a college and career writing a
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
cte credential thank you
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question my
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
concern is with those students who are
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
caught in the middle of a parental
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
custody dispute and one of them lives in
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
one part of the state and the other one
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
lives in another and each has custody
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
for a part of the time and the poor kid
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the schools
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
are caught with how they're delivering
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
service and if they particularly they
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
have a specialized program or something
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
like that it just sounds like a terrible
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
nightmare for the schools i mean i we
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
have had conversations with schools
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
about how that can be a challenge but as
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
far as the reporting side of things
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
there are no issues for us
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
so they can they can in our system
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
report who is financially responsible
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
for the child the district that's
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
financially responsible they can report
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
that a child is duly enrolled we have
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
all of those capabilities on the
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that the services are
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
provided and who pays for the services
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
those are the unfortunately the local
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
schools need to work through those
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
situations but on the funding and the
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
reporting side for the department of
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's reported to the department of
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
education twice a year in october first
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the year at the end of
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
the year as an aggregate of what
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
happened throughout the entire year
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
so if a child were to move around
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
multiple times during the year that's
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
when we would collect that information
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year that's reported
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
to the department of education in july
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
and august
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
and reconciled through all the different
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
different systems differing schools can
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
reconcile that
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
and our system actually requires that
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
too so we have a report called the
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
student too busy report right now and it
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
will say um hey both concord high school
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
and hopkinton high school you both
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
reported caitlyn davis she obviously
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
didn't go both those schools what
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
happened and it will you know say oh
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
well there was some overlap for this
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
period of time or the service or what
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
what not so our system does have all
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
those capabilities right now thank you
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent cornell
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
what happens to this acid number if say
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
a middle school student this is from
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
working in a middle school for many
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
years that the parents withdraw them and
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
say we're going to florida and we never
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
get a request for a record and we never
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
find out what happens
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
where they where they actually go do
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
they go anywhere or they could be
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
sitting so so they um with the school
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
district will have to withdraw the child
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
using the appropriate withdrawal code
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
which is exit to an addition state a
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
different state um and then that and
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
there's no additional information past
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
that date of that withdrawal
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay so this it just goes into like a
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
thing of they withdrew and that's it
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
so there's no tracking of
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have any interstate tracking of
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
sure thanks thanks um um uh
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair and and and thanks again and
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you you're sort of like being
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
peppered by them
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
these are good questions
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
but i think this is really um
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
almost uh um you know a learning session
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the for the committee on
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
on this um
 
00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:53.269 align:start position:0%
on this um
uh

00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
is there any role for uh for first acid
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
beyond um secondary
 
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.549 align:start position:0%
beyond um secondary
education

00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
i mean it depends on where you want to
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
track data so um you could track attract
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
somebody all over the place you can
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
track them into post-secondary
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment you could you could track
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
them into a employment sort of situation
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
the department of education does not
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
collect social security numbers so
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
anytime you want or and we actually are
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited from law to collect and use
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
social security numbers um so
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
somebody would need to either say well
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
to get true mapping of this person
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of their life
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's post-secondary enrollment
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
or employment or whatnot we would need
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
to find some sort of unique identifier
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
to continue on through that situation
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
so either this asset number or having
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
the department of education use social
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
security numbers
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
and so quick quick follow-up so so
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
currently none of our the community
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
college system the university system in
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire do not
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
use acid numbers um
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
so i believe they have access assassin
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
numbers but there's not a lot of um
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
talking and tracking and whatnot right
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
now through that it's an area where
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
there could be improvement but i believe
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
they do have the authority to use asset
 
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.470 align:start position:0%
they do have the authority to use asset
numbers

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
and the only reason i bring that up is
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
because that has been discussed as a you
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
know degree attainment post-secondary
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
degree attainment has been discussed as
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
an outcome measure so right now we don't
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
have information our systems don't tie
 
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.070 align:start position:0%
have information our systems don't tie
together

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
now many of you probably know the
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
department of education is undergoing a
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
robust overhaul of our current system
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
and we may actually have better
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
capabilities going forward if that's
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
were to be required going forward
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
we're jumping quickly here because we
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
know you're running short how do we uh
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
accomplish this audit trail of those who
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
have access to the
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
like a superintendent superintendents
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
are here today and gone tomorrow
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
and and we're seeing a lot of retirement
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
going on how do we know that those
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
people that had access when they leave
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
no longer have access we lock them out
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
of our system um so we actually control
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
all of the access on our system
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
um and the schools require so
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
on our side of things so each school has
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
a person in the system that can allow a
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent or a designee in there so
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's a an i4c coordinator we have very
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
specific trainings around the
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
requirements of an i4c coordinator um
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
and then we have on our side of things
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
our collections that we do about who is
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and whatnot and that
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
ties back through our the entire
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
operation of our system so a
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent is required to do a
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
course size submission a course in class
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
submission that shows various different
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
data when that if that course commission
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
is not done or does not affect the
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate superintendent it kicks data
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
out on other places so we've got it tied
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
throughout our system
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it the one thing that tends to be
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
is sometimes there can be a lag so if a
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent does leave and there's a
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
report that needs to be submitted the
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
old superintendent's credentials have
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
been shut down and then we need to
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
obviously add a new superintendent in
 
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.430 align:start position:0%
obviously add a new superintendent in
so

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
are there further questions i know
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
caitlyn has to run here a representative
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
litchfield and then represent woodpark
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
just quickly thank you first of all um
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
just quickly
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
so i can put it in the record um
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
if the acronyms fasted exactly what is
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
it state assign student identifier i'm
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
sorry state assigned student identifier
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock thank you just
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
quickly two simple ones um can another
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
school who has access to sasser numbers
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
check assassin's number from a different
 
00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:38.870 align:start position:0%
check assassin's number from a different
school

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
as far as i am i'm a assassin okay
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
administrator at school x i want to
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
check a student at school why who may
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
come to schoolx
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
um as far as as
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
chat i mean you can
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
you can look up to see if there's a
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
similar record but you wouldn't be able
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
to res you wouldn't be able to view any
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
sort of academic records or anything
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
like that but you could see if you were
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
trying to put caitlyn david davis in
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
this school with this acid number that
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
it would say oh this kid is already
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
enrolled in this other school so there
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
is just as far as duplication of records
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
but no
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
confidential information or no academic
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
information is tied to it at that time
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
so here's why i can only i can only
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
review those youngsters who are in my
 
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.470 align:start position:0%
review those youngsters who are in my
school

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.669 align:start position:0%
school
profile

00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
profile
 
00:30:25.679 --> 00:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
profile
yes

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.669 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
as far as academic information yes yeah
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
can the cte director which also has
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
those students in his high school
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
access this asset
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes so the cte director would be
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
accessing information in kate which is a
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
subsection of i foresee um and so
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's specific information on those
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
those kids that are cte kids and
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
because of the data reporting
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
requirements that that come with that so
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
a lot to learn on this
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
well we're at 9 30 i know you have to
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
hustle out here and we didn't want to go
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
over that time i appreciate that i can
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
be back too for further questions on
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%

uh okay we we're still in uh 1626.
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
um we haven't closed that hearing down
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
which would like to
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
provide further information i have the
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
one card and that was from

to close this down
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
coincidentally when she talked and i was
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're ready to go ahead
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
because it is 9 30. uh we're opening up
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing now on hb 1649.
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
this bill is relative to the unique
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
pupil identification for pupils in in
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
the education freedom accounts program
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's a continuance of what we were
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
starting we were discussing with caitlin
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
welcome representative tanner
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
cart came before the horse or whatever
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
um that's that's how i feel is what's
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
going to happen with this um
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
this summer when i was uh debating bills
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
to put in
 
00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:45.990 align:start position:0%
to put in
um

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
i had and i was looking through my
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
statute book and
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
came up with the unique
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
pupil identifier section
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
and my intent with 1649
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
is to require this sacid or
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
unique pupil identifier to be given to
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
each child who is being educated in new
 
00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:08.069 align:start position:0%
each child who is being educated in new
hampshire

00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
using public funding
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
in order to provide aggregate data to
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
review the programs and make informed
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
decisions that's my intent with this
 
00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
decisions that's my intent with this
bill

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i worked with ols
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh so we probably were fumbling through
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
it at the at the same rate
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
anyway um it's interesting to hear
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
caitlin's first and then mine um some of
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
you may not even realize what um a
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
unique pupil identifier is but it was
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
set up
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
to really cover the privacy of
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
individual students and it's done very
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
well i think
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
it's part of a program not just in new
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire but across the united states
 
00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
hampshire but across the united states
and

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's supposed to
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
attract pupils in the new hampshire
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
system education system
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
from early childhood programs to
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
district and then post-secondary
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
institutions so
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
at least that's what's in the law
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
even though they may not do much with it
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
at the post-secondary level right now
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
unique pupil identifier protects student
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
privacy while offering unique student
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
identifiers to
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
to gain aggregate aggregate data to
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
improve the quality accuracy and
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
reliability of student data the
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
information is kept in a data warehouse
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
at the department of education and the
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
statute again is 195 or 193
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
e colon 5. so if you want to look that
 
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.510 align:start position:0%
e colon 5. so if you want to look that
up

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.190 align:start position:0%
up
um

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
since i've been on this committee
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
i've been concerned with the eligibility
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
and accountability of our ever extend ex
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
expanding and extended learning and
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
voucher programs
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
since the alternative and extended
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities were largely
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
organized implemented and assessed by a
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
third party agency
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
namely the scholarship organization
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
among one of a couple
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
many students would not have a unique
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
pupil identifier
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
data collection would be difficult if
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
not impossible in these cases and
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of that unified
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
tracking system
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
we couldn't really assess pupil
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
achievement effectiveness proper
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
distribution of the public funds
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
and i feel this system of the unique
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
pupil identifier
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
will help us do that
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
and help us with future decisions
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
reviews and investigations of these
 
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.589 align:start position:0%
reviews and investigations of these
programs

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
that would be based on real data
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
and that could be quantified and and was
 
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.710 align:start position:0%
and that could be quantified and and was
subjective

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
so um i was you know trying to find out
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
why there were two bills almost exactly
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
the same going through it seemed that it
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
should have been sorted out before this
 
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.510 align:start position:0%
should have been sorted out before this
but

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
um here we are
 
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.310 align:start position:0%
um here we are
and

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
just to give you some slight differences
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
as caitlyn said there are some slight
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
differences between the two i didn't
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
include charter schools because i had no
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
idea that they were not included
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
in statute because they're always you
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
know yesterday all day we heard they
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
were public schools okay
 
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.990 align:start position:0%
were public schools okay
um

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.109 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
my bill uh speaks to uh the efa accounts
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
whereas i believe the
 
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.710 align:start position:0%
whereas i believe the
1626

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
1626
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
only talks about the scholarship
 
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.589 align:start position:0%
only talks about the scholarship
organization

00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
and since the scholarship organization
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
has never put in an rfp
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
and there's also a giving and going
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
alliance that
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
distributes some of these educational
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
freedom accounts or tax credits accounts
 
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
freedom accounts or tax credits accounts
um

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
i felt that it needed to be in the in
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
the statute so that um
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the future if another organization or
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
even if the state decided um
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
to take over the job that now the
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization has
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
um and take back the 10 percent that the
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh makes off the top of those uh
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
scholarships that uh it would be good to
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
um have a wider statement in the
 
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.950 align:start position:0%
um have a wider statement in the
law

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh the last thing i think that is
 
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.310 align:start position:0%
uh the last thing i think that is
different

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
is if you look at the last page of of my
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
bill 14
 
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.790 align:start position:0%
bill 14
1649

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
1649
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that there's um
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
on page 3
 
00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:22.470 align:start position:0%
on page 3
line

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.069 align:start position:0%
line
23

00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
23
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
i've also put in a new paragraph
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
under the educa education freedom
 
00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:30.150 align:start position:0%
under the educa education freedom
accounts

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization authority and
 
00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.990 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization authority and
responsibilities

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
um so it's amending
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
rsa 194-f
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
colon 4 and it inserts the following
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph that the scholarship
 
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.069 align:start position:0%
paragraph that the scholarship
organization

00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
shall request and maintain unique pupil
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
identifiers pursuant to 193 e5
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
which shall be kept to aggregate data
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
reported to the department of education
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
to certify student eligibility because i
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
was concerned that
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
we would have students take the efa
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then either use it out of state or
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
move out of state and there would be no
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
way for
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire to track that
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how the scholarship
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
organization has set up to track things
 
00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:17.109 align:start position:0%
organization has set up to track things
to

00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
residency age
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
income and determine the enrollment
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
status with resident schools
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
to record annual record records of
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.870 align:start position:0%
to record annual record records of
attainment

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
attainment
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
to report qualifying expense records and
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with the rules and
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and i i've also made this
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
effective 60 days after passage whereas
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
the other bill is effective on passage
 
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.109 align:start position:0%
the other bill is effective on passage
um

00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's one other thing i wanted to
 
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.430 align:start position:0%
there's one other thing i wanted to
mention

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
mention
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
with that too
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
but i hope i'll think about it and
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
maybe come up with it so but that's
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
basically why they're different i i
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
think they can easily
 
00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:56.950 align:start position:0%
think they can easily
be

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
connected together uh and main because i
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
think the intent
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
certainly from the department of
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
education that wrote the the first bill
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
is that they they realized that they
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
needed this
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
to track the efa people as well because
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
of the adequacy payments um
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
and uh so i think the the need is there
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
there's no question about that is
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit in the wording and
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
delivery of it
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
so i'm open for questions thank you very
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
much uh represent luno
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
you very much representative tanner for
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
bringing this um forward um there uh
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
there certainly seems to be a lot of
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
similarity between um 1626 and in 1649
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
as you've as you've clearly
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
laid out here i was wondering if you
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
could comment a little bit more on
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
on what you see is the difference
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
between the the term that you're using
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
in 1649
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
called quote scholarship organization
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
for the distribute distribution of efas
 
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.950 align:start position:0%
for the distribute distribution of efas
and

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
the term
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
it used in 1626 which is scholarship
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
organization yeah just and i think i i
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
tried to mention this before but
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh just to put a pin in it is that the
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization that's
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
currently in place has never had an rfp
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
and was set up to do the tax credit
 
00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:22.950 align:start position:0%
and was set up to do the tax credit
scholarships

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
which did not use supposedly public
 
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.030 align:start position:0%
which did not use supposedly public
funding

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
but now it's using public funding
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
through adequacy
 
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.750 align:start position:0%
through adequacy
and

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully they'll have an rfp coming up
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
but there may be other scholarship
 
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.230 align:start position:0%
but there may be other scholarship
organizations

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
that will
 
00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.430 align:start position:0%
that will
eventually

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
or might take over this particular task
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly the giving and going
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
alliance which is still active
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
which gives scholarships to christian
 
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.790 align:start position:0%
which gives scholarships to christian
schools

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
uh is part of this mix as well and so i
 
00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
uh is part of this mix as well and so i
think

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
for the distribution of efas
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
is an important
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh preposition to the scholarship
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
organization so it isn't just
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
the current scholarship organization
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
yes follow up on that so um when you put
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
down for the distribution of efas
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
would that specifically exclude then a
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization that's um
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's managing the the tax credit um
 
00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.829 align:start position:0%
that's managing the the tax credit um
scholarships

00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
not if they're if they are um
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
distributing the efas then they're the
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization right now so
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
these the scholarship organization is
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
listed here excuse me if for example
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
liberty mutual decided that they were
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
going to be the scholarship organization
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
to distribute these efa funds um then
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
they would still fit this particular
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be it isn't as expansive
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank thank you very much uh
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
represent tanner i have a question um
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
throughout um our our conversation i'm
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
meaning the committee and what what
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
you've got in
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
law right here especially on page three
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
where you've added the new paragraph you
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
talk about aggregate data reported
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
aggregate aggregate and
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
if i'm a
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
school principal
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
of data i oftentimes would
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
access this assassin information
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
looking for individual student data in
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
terms of attendance
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
previous behavior suspension expulsion
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
et cetera
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that we're not
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
always talking aggregate data which i
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
know what that is and you know what that
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
is and what it's used for for you know
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
delivery of an instruction meeting all
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
those indicators for meeting delivery of
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
an adequate education yes
 
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.069 align:start position:0%
an adequate education yes
but

00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
is there not this other purpose that we
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
have this set up to provide
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
a person like who is a high school
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
principal like mr woodcock over here
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
that information about a student might
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
be enrolled or has been enrolled in
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
his or her school
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i think
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
i think the this bill that i've
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
introduced doesn't change what uh
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock if he was
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
principal of an elementary school i
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
believe um
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
high school was a high school okay um
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
what he would want to get it doesn't
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
change that at all the the last
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph speaks just to the efas into
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization and every
 
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.589 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization and every
time

00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
i've asked for any information from the
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
well informed
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
that they are not allowed to give out
 
00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:50.550 align:start position:0%
that they are not allowed to give out
individual

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
information nor are they
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
they're in
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
focused on confidentiality and not
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
releasing anything but aggregate data so
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's why in that particular one
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
that particular paragraph
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
which doesn't apply
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%

responsibility yeah
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative moffitt
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you ms chairman thank you for
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
on page the page that says page two at
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
the top
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
if you go down to
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
lines 15-16 set question on that
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
it says the information maintaining the
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
data warehouse shall be available to the
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
department of education that's in
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you add the legislative budget
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
office and the attorney general's office
 
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.790 align:start position:0%
office and the attorney general's office
so

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
my question is um
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
why couldn't those two new other
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
officers just ask doe for the
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
information in other words the
 
00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:16.550 align:start position:0%
information in other words the
the

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
intent of the student identifier number
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
is to try to protect the privacy of the
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
students so the more places we push this
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
information out to
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
the greater the chance that there might
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
be a leak or something so so why were
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office and
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
why would you want to send this
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
information there
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question i think uh
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
caitlyn davis answered that and the fact
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
that she recognized it was there and
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
said that um they actually do
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
would have access to it because they are
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
an agency of the state and they are
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
um you know a confidential agency it
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
would be only in instances where they
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
would have to do a review now the lba
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
is responsible for the oversight of the
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship committee
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general's office would
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
be involved if there was any fraud in
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
that particular program that's why as
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
just uh the like i said from the 3000
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
foot level from a person who didn't have
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
access to a lot of information
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
um writing this bill um
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be important to
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
put that in
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
so i guess my follow-up question is
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
for the protection of the data again as
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
i said before the more places it goes to
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
the greater the chance of leaking why
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't the attorney general's office
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
or the legislative budget office just go
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
to doa if they needed to
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
and and ask for them
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
ask them for the information rather than
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
having it pushed to them okay well i
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
guess i guess my other concern with that
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
um and i i totally see your question and
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
it may not even be necessary to put that
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
in if that's that's your point on that
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
that was caitlyn's point that these
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
people already have access to that
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
my concern has been that we have not
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot of data from the department
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
of education and when we have some of it
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
has not been
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh totally accurate like uh the physical
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
note for
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
the uh efas in the first place which has
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
gone from
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
120 000 to 68 million dollars now
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.349 align:start position:0%
120 000 to 68 million dollars now
so

00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
um you know i want to make sure
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
personally i wanted to make sure that
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
these agencies which are responsible for
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
some oversight to this third
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
party agency that's now involved with
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
our state education programs
 
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.549 align:start position:0%
our state education programs
um

00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
have the ability to seek this data and
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
that it's in statute
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
i i might follow a little bit on that
 
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.349 align:start position:0%
i i might follow a little bit on that
um

00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.150 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and the
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
legislative budget office uh especially
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
the lba
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
has authority to do a performance audit
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
on any aspect of our educational systems
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
there was a performance audit that was
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
just requested representative mullen you
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
were a participant on that where we're
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
looking for a performance audit in terms
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
of special education
 
00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:16.470 align:start position:0%
of special education
and

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
when they are tasked to do that by this
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislature we have that authority to do
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
then they don't need to go to doe
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
begging saying hey we're trying to have
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
access to this particular system to do
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
this performance audit whether they have
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
it or not they need it
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
um so that they can complete their tasks
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
and so we can get the information
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
i think the other the other thing to
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
note though is that the scholarship
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
organization if they
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
they feel this fraud um they're supposed
 
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.030 align:start position:0%
they feel this fraud um they're supposed
to

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
alert the attorney general's office and
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
the lba and then those two
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
groups actually do the actual audits um
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
and again it just i thought i felt it
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
would be more secure
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
to have it in statute um that that they
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
were able to
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
get this information so
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you both
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
yeah the
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
lba is a huge office it's the few staff
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
we have in this building is just the
 
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:17.670 align:start position:0%
we have in this building is just the
edge

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
edge
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
um there's a huge office there that does
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
these performance audits and it's been
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
we've been very fortunate to have some
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
really good performance audits done for
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
us in the past which have netted us
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
information to go further with
 
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.150 align:start position:0%
information to go further with
legislation

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you are there other questions
 
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.349 align:start position:0%
so thank you are there other questions
for

00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%

children's scholarship fun
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
i wish
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
kaitlyn was here i'm not going to be
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
able to do her justice she would be able
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
to explain this better than i
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh i believe we're talking about sasid's
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
and the i4c system
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
i do want to mention a couple points
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the law that you're discussing today
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh section and it says that i'm not sure
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
if she went over this with you or or not
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
but the commissioner does
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
have the power to allow anyone to to go
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
into this acid system so i'm not sure
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
if you really need to
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know give us explicit authority or
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
not since the commission already has
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
that but i really want to talk about the
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
technical points of this last paragraph
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
that you just discussed
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
there are certain abilities that the i4c
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
the i4c system does allow us to check
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
student enrollment and we also use the
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
sas system with the unique pupil
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
identifier number to upload to the doe
 
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.430 align:start position:0%
identifier number to upload to the doe
database

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the ois and the boys
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
what it would not allow us to do
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
is it would not allow us to put
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
financial data in there
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
as it s as as it appears that you would
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
like us to do
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
and it simply doesn't have that
 
00:52:29.839 --> 00:52:33.910 align:start position:0%
and it simply doesn't have that
capability

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
it also would not allow us to
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
put in data to say comply with program
 
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.190 align:start position:0%
put in data to say comply with program
rules

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
our contract does require us to
 
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.589 align:start position:0%
our contract does require us to
um

00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
report aggregated student assessment
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
data once a year so we do do that
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i believe that that is in the i4c
 
00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.230 align:start position:0%
and i believe that that is in the i4c
system

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.109 align:start position:0%
system
uh

00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
the sasa does collect unique pupil id
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
numbers in the data doa database but it
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have residency data attached to
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
it so we couldn't use it for that
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
and we do obviously we do collect income
 
00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:19.990 align:start position:0%
and we do obviously we do collect income
data

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that that is in the i4c
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
system although we do use the i4c system
 
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.790 align:start position:0%
system although we do use the i4c system
obviously

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with department of
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
education for them to award the grants
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch
 
00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.750 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch
so

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make those points
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.589 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
so

00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of the assessment data
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh this statewide performance tool
 
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.430 align:start position:0%
uh this statewide performance tool
um

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
aggregate data versus individual data
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
exactly aggregated data non-identifying
 
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.910 align:start position:0%
exactly aggregated data non-identifying
so

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
so the your organization's going to
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
throw in that we are
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
the enrollment in this school is at the
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
55th percentile or
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
you're not going to know exactly where
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
individual students are in fact that the
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
commissioners looking to find out you
 
00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:11.589 align:start position:0%
commissioners looking to find out you
know

00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a specific attendance issue
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
and discipline issue also wanting to
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
look at achievement and growth um that's
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
not going to be available uh i'm i pro i
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
can't answer that right now i would have
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
to go back and
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay get more detail for you
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
now c thank you very much thank you
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
we have no other pink cards up here so
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to close this hearing thank
 
00:54:38.559 --> 00:54:41.589 align:start position:0%
we're going to close this hearing thank
you

00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
yep five minutes
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
or a little bit more
 
00:54:45.520 --> 01:03:29.990 align:start position:0%
or a little bit more
seven

01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
i'll turn my mic on so
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
knowing we're streaming
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh 1295 is a bill requiring reports
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
concerning school policies on classroom
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
recordings and in classroom observers
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
and represent moffat is the prime
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill uh representative
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
moffat is here welcome
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and you notice the
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
chair just said uh we're going live
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're streaming and i'm going to come
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
back to that
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
for the record uh
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
i'm state representative mike moffatt
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
representing merrimack district 9 which
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
includes the lovely town of canterbury
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
which features shaker village and also
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
the lovely town of loudoun which
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
features howard pearl's maple syrup
 
01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:09.109 align:start position:0%
features howard pearl's maple syrup
so

01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
this measure is a reprise by the way i
 
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:12.950 align:start position:0%
this measure is a reprise by the way i
did

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
email everyone this uh a draft for this
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
testimony last night
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
so this measure is a reprise of last
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
year's hb 321 which is now law
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
hb 321
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
simply asked if you recall that school
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
districts share what if anything
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
they were doing to identify and support
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
for best practices folder at the
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
department of education and early
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
indications are that the gifted measure
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
that is passed
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
and is now off
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
is getting a very good response the
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
school districts all over the state are
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
now having internal discussions on how
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
to better support that previously
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
underserved student population
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
and with no policy mandate or spending
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
requirement so
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
some of us see that as a real success
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
story and we'd like this to emulate that
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
so hb 1295 similarly asks school
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
districts to simply share their
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
classroom observation policies as well
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
as audio visual audio video streaming
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
and recording policies with the doe
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
for another best practices folder
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
virtual folder
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
so attention to this area became
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
important during the
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing i was going to say recent but
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
the ongoing covid pandemic
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
when so many schools went to hybrid
 
01:05:37.119 --> 01:05:38.309 align:start position:0%
when so many schools went to hybrid
instruction

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
and remote instruction
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
some schools went totally remote nashua
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
for example closed its doors for over a
 
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.190 align:start position:0%
for example closed its doors for over a
year

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
so remote learning raised new questions
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
in numerous areas to include technology
 
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.510 align:start position:0%
in numerous areas to include technology
issues

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
cost issues access issues privacy issues
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
legal issues and more
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
what about homes that do not have
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
internet access or families that don't
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
have computers
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
and then there's the issue of recording
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
if a
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
student misses an online session
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
what are the ramifications of he or she
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
viewing your recorded version later on
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
and are schools making provisions for
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
recording and saving such sessions
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
and i would point out as i touched on
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
earlier when the chair mentioned
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
streaming um our committee hearings are
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
being recorded the same on youtube um
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
presumably in perpetuity or forever
 
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.390 align:start position:0%
presumably in perpetuity or forever
uh

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
as as i speak as we're here
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
in fact there's a camera right there
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
looking at me and i would say hello to
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
the people watching live however many
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
there are and also
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
to the people from the future again
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
these all of our sessions are recorded
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
and they're on youtube i've gone back
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
and looked at pieces a few of them 20
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
years ago somebody
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
may call this very
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh session up and to see what our what
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
our discus what the bill
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
how the bill was introduced and
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
how we dealt with it and these folks
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
from the future will know if it passed
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
they'll know who the president nominated
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
for supreme court or if tom brady ever
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
retired so people from the future
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
will see
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
what we have what we're putting out
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
there to include this very moment
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
but these hearings differ from classroom
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
sessions of course many high school and
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
college students record
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
or seek to record lectures for future
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
study and review purposes
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh teachers and professors typically
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
include recording protocols in their
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
syllabi and i used to
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
most syllabi have a section for
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of the individual
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
professor or or teacher
 
01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.670 align:start position:0%
professor or or teacher
um

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
but educators who don't mind their
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
lectures being recorded sometimes have
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
issues with ubiquitous cell phones so
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
take taping policies sometimes conflict
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
with recording policies for example
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
cell phones here's mine
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
if a
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
teacher or professor has a policy that
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
cell phones can't be deployed
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
that might be in conflict with their
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
recording policy where they say yes you
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
can record my uh my lectures or whatever
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's that type of thing in
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
this brave new world uh
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
needs some attention
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
so that's why a best practices folder in
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
this area could be very useful
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the same way that the best practices
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
folder has turned out to be
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
useful regarding gifted students and
 
01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.349 align:start position:0%
useful regarding gifted students and
that

01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then there is the
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
classroom observer issue which is part
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
of this measure
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
when i was classroom teacher i'd
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
occasionally get requests from parents
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
to sit in
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
didn't happen often but it occurred
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
but classrooms can only accommodate so
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
many visitors of course like you know
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
this room can only accommodate so many
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
visitors although this can
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
this room can accommodate a lot more
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
visitors than a typical classroom
 
01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:22.950 align:start position:0%
visitors than a typical classroom
so

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
in their administrative classroom visits
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of teacher evaluations
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
they announced or unannounced varies
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
from district to district
 
01:09:34.239 --> 01:09:35.269 align:start position:0%
from district to district
so

01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
again with classroom visits
 
01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.709 align:start position:0%
again with classroom visits
presumably

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
district schools have policies on if a
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
parent or a board member or
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to sit in a class it's
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
different now because it's there are
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
more security measures in terms of
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
classroom visitations
 
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.669 align:start position:0%
classroom visitations
um

01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
and this bill doesn't is not
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
prescriptive it doesn't
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
have any any policy party just is asking
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
what's what's being done out there again
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
for a best practices folder
 
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.990 align:start position:0%
for a best practices folder
um

01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
when i taught high school many years ago
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
few had ever heard of the internet i
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
guess it existed but you know
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't know that it didn't it was
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
very small but nowadays
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's everywhere
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
so for remote classes nowadays you know
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
who can tune in uh what's happening
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
i don't suspect there's a vast audience
 
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.790 align:start position:0%
i don't suspect there's a vast audience
but

01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
anybody who's on youtube can hear my
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
voice now
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
and they can as i said earlier they can
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
go back and listen to it later
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
so what if a parent wants to watch a uh
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
high school class
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
or in this in the last year and a half
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
almost two years
 
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.189 align:start position:0%
almost two years
um

01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
when school many schools went to hybrid
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
or remote you know that raises some
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
concerns about you know who's watching
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
these classes can parents watch can
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
others watch you know the interactive uh
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
questions that that really need some
 
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.950 align:start position:0%
questions that that really need some
attention

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
um what if the link to a class is is
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
shared widely uh are there you know
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
passwords to get in
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
probably uh will it be on youtube
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
forever what if what if there's an open
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
mic uh situation as this happened um
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
in the legislature several times
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
what if what if a student um does
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
something embarrassing
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh makes a mistake is that going to be
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
out there forever on youtube
 
01:11:34.719 --> 01:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
out there forever on youtube
or

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
if it's not on youtube and a lot of
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
these high school or
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
school remote sessions were not
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily on youtube it maybe would
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
not even be being recorded unless what
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
if surreptitiously a family a parent a
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
student of somebody
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
records a
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
classroom session
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
how do you control that again i i don't
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
know those are questions that
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
need attention
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
many of us think
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't have answers only questions
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
this bill would help create that virtual
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
folder which would provide some answers
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
alternatives options
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
and information
 
01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
and information
um

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
and i will say that uh represent
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative hobson and i had a
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
session with the commissioner uh caitlin
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
davis was there a couple other officials
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
from boe just to talk about several
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
measures including this one doe
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
with regard to the gifted bill which
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
again is law they have sent out a
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
template and they have a process to
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
accept and receive this information that
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
is now being talked about
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
um all over the state forget you know
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
for gifted students um
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know taking care of them same thing
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
here they if this were to move forward
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
or some version of this would move
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
forward so that they could have another
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
virtual folder or best practices folder
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
so that people can see
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
and compare what's being done what the
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
issues are what the concerns are is they
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
see a need for it
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
i see a need for it
 
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.390 align:start position:0%
i see a need for it
um

01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
and yes this could uh the question comes
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
up you know why do we need a statue
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
can't do we like put out a memo or rules
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
and ask for this and that could be done
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
but again as with other measures like
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
the gifted measure if something's in
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
statute if it has the imprimatur of
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
legislative concern or interest
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
if it's a law
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
it matters it matters a lot if something
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
is a statute as opposed to a memo or a
 
01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.270 align:start position:0%
is a statute as opposed to a memo or a
rule

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
that is about it and again i would again
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
state and emphasize to finish this up
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
that this requirement could in many
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
cases simply be satisfied
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
with the gifted bill again which is the
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
model for this you know there are
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
concerns it's an unfunded mandate or
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to we need to send the
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
schools money so they can implement this
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
or hire people whatever
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.910 align:start position:0%
and again
this

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
requirement shouldn't move forward could
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
probably in many cases be
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
answered or responded to in a few in a
 
01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.510 align:start position:0%
answered or responded to in a few in a
minute

01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
minute
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
an administrative assistant or a
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
secretary could just send an email with
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
a link or an attachment of their of
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
policies to doe so they could file it
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
and in many cases as with the gifted
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill many schools had nothing going on
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
for for gifted students and so their
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
response was we're not doing anything in
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
this area same with this um
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
we don't see it at all is it an onerous
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
administrative uh unfunded mandate
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
just as you know again
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
an email with an attachment or if if
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is an impetus for local discussion
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
on this issue that maybe would be useful
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
and should happen that that's up to the
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
district if they if they want to
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
dive down and dig into this
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
if no policies exist regarding recording
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
or visitation issues then the this
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
measure again as i said would could
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
provide that impetus so that's
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
what 1295 is about and i'd be happy to
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there are any
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and um and
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
good to see you this morning
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt um i was
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk a little bit
 
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.070 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk a little bit
about

01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
what you i guess have been able to find
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
able to find
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
online with regards to
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
either best practices or
 
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.110 align:start position:0%
either best practices or
or

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know guidance from either the state
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
or federal
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
departments of education numerous other
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
organizations education commission of
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
with respect particularly to classroom
 
01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.750 align:start position:0%
with respect particularly to classroom
recording

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
recording
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
and remote learning given so much has
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
been done uh in this area over the last
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
couple years sure that's a great
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
question um and to answer it i've done a
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
cursory uh google search on on you know
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
some of the if you google classroom
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
recording policies you know all kinds of
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
things will come up
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
um so i've done it like i said a cursory
 
01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.270 align:start position:0%
um so i've done it like i said a cursory
very

01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know simple search to just get a
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
sense of you know what is out there i'm
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
always interested in what other states
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
are doing and again
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's not much in statute because this
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
is this this issue of hybrid or remote
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
high school and in public school classes
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
is a new phenomenon really going back to
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know covert is less than
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's really less than two years old so
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh i've done a little bit but i
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
will and want to do more and i i think
 
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
that if this moves forward whether it
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
moves or not districts i think need to
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
pay attention to this and come up with
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
some policies
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
um but no i haven't i haven't done a
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
thorough comprehensive uh
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of what's out there yet but but
 
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.229 align:start position:0%
analysis of what's out there yet but but
this

01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh i think would help that to occur um
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
if this virtual folder
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
was established a doe
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
then they would
 
01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.430 align:start position:0%
then they would
have

01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
all kinds of stuff coming in that they
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
could look at or not and again
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement here for doe to
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
process the information simply to
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
warehouse it if you will
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
and with gifted um they
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
are already
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
have a template or a folder in place now
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
if whether it's gifted or this bill if
 
01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.870 align:start position:0%
if whether it's gifted or this bill if
doe

01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
doe
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
evaluated on their own time if they
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to or someone else
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
if one of us or whoever wanted to go to
 
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.990 align:start position:0%
if one of us or whoever wanted to go to
d-o-e-d-o-e

01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
d-o-e-d-o-e
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
and see what's come in and uh see see
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
things that have never been thought
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
about before perhaps some
 
01:17:45.679 --> 01:17:46.709 align:start position:0%
about before perhaps some
possible

01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
proposed statute might come out of that
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
i have nothing in mind at this time but
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
to gather this information one spot and
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
then have somebody evaluate mainly to
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
identifying something that needs
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
attention in statute maybe
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
a long answer but hopefully that
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
the questions represent woodcock
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
president good morning
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't think tom's gonna retire
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.390 align:start position:0%
this year
um

01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
that that being said uh as far as the
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
your policy have you had a chance uh to
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
speak with the school boys association
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of their policy templates that
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
they work with all the school boys on as
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
regards these issues
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
i have not yet uh
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
i see i say unfortunately there's not
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
too many folks here
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
but another great question uh no i have
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
not um get into anything with the school
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
board association
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
that is something that would maybe
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
happen if there was a specific policy
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
measure that was proposed and this
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a policy measure it's not a
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
spending measure it's just a you know
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
gathering information measure so uh
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
again great great question i'm sure i'm
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
sure they would be very interested in
 
01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:57.910 align:start position:0%
sure they would be very interested in
this

01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh but again this is just a
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
measure to gather information not to
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
push any specific statute
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i asked that because it seems
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
to me that there's two
 
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
to me that there's two
uh

01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
clearly different uh pieces of this
 
01:19:13.679 --> 01:19:14.709 align:start position:0%
clearly different uh pieces of this
policy

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
one would be the standard incl you call
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
it observer there's classroom visitor
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
policy which i'm sure most schools
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
already have and the school association
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
probably has templates for it and then
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
of course the streaming one um so
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's like two distinct things the the
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
traditional in classroom i'm sure all
 
01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:31.780 align:start position:0%
the schools have that just for safety
 
01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.030 align:start position:0%
the schools have that just for safety
[Music]

01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
so the second part of the question is as
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
i read the end of the statute request it
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
talks about initial time frames of
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
initial presentation or
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
information reported back to the
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner and then it has followed up
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
with any subsequent changes uh november
 
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.030 align:start position:0%
with any subsequent changes uh november
one

01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
so if if school board x replies that
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
here's our policies and link link link
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
they have on file right
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
and they make no changes so there's no
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
more they're done
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
next november the following it's just a
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
one-time shot until such a point that
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
they change their policy is that how you
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
interpret that correct yes okay all
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
right thank you thank you chairman
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and i don't think tom's going
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
to retire right now
 
01:20:14.239 --> 01:20:15.750 align:start position:0%
to retire right now
um

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i hope not actually i love watching
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
him um what i'm wondering is and you
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
were you were on a school board uh for a
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
while and thank you for doing that uh
 
01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:25.910 align:start position:0%
while and thank you for doing that uh
that's

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
quite a job
 
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.070 align:start position:0%
quite a job
um

01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
do you see that
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
request

01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
has a legal ramification to it
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
that the gifted and talented didn't
 
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.189 align:start position:0%
that the gifted and talented didn't
okay

01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
i always tell my students to repeat the
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
question what's in your question so the
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
question was
 
01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.950 align:start position:0%
question was
do

01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
do i see this as having legal
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
ramifications uh
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
that the gifted measure did not
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question uh
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
interesting question and i think i think
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
you may be onto something i i i think
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
that the gifted bill
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh simply asked
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
for what are you doing and let us know
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
what you're doing i think this is
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
different i think i think you're onto
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
something i think that
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
given the world wide web and and uh you
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
know the internet there are certainly
 
01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.550 align:start position:0%
know the internet there are certainly
potential

01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh privacy issues that
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
they would have legal ramifications that
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
would be part of this
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
so coming out of this um
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
yes i think that that this measure would
 
01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.229 align:start position:0%
yes i think that that this measure would
definitely

01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
um potentially involve some legal issues
 
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
that um just weren't part of the gifted
 
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
that um just weren't part of the gifted
bill

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.430 align:start position:0%
bill
yes

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
in the past it seems to me that we had
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
people here and and there was some
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure where it is in the
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
statues maybe uh attorney fenton can
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
gear me to that area about surveillance
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
and about the you know the ability of
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
people to come in and hack
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
i'm also concerned
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
that a teacher may want to copyright
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
that some parent who has heard on
 
01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.470 align:start position:0%
that some parent who has heard on
some

01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
talk radio that their local school has
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
crt and now wants to
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
view all the videotapes from
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
the history class to make sure you know
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
that they haven't brought up some nasty
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
subjects or something that they don't
 
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.950 align:start position:0%
subjects or something that they don't
want

01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i feel like these are legal issues
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
and i feel like they're local control
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
issues and i feel like yes it's probably
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
good to put it out there to school
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
boards and to parents and to teachers
 
01:22:44.719 --> 01:22:46.149 align:start position:0%
boards and to parents and to teachers
organizations

01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know the commissioner is is thinking
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
of this but i also think it's um
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
opening pandora's box to have
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
something like a repository first
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
and and the legal things
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
second i think we're kind of putting the
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse again
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
with this bill and i was wondering if
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
you could see
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
 
really

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
pretty profound
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
given that there'd be a repository at
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
the at the commissioner's office in the
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
department of ed
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question i
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
actually kind of feel the
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
kind of the opposite position i think
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
that you make some points like for
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
example i hadn't thought necessarily
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
about surveillance but uh surveillance
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
videos or cameras are every they're
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous they're everywhere today i
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
didn't even thought of that
 
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.750 align:start position:0%
didn't even thought of that
um

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.030 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
the the notion of a
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
a repository or or
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
a folder that just has
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
existing policies that are already
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
public just putting them in one bigger
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
folder for the convenience of someone
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
who wants to look into them i think that
 
01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:58.229 align:start position:0%
who wants to look into them i think that
that

01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
obviously i think that's a good thing
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned copywriting lectures again
 
01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.350 align:start position:0%
you mentioned copywriting lectures again
um

01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
some classes are different i know
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
so uh a p
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
i know people who just
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh taped every
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
anatomy physiology lecture and then
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
played them over and over and studied
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
all the bones and stuff that that type
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
of thing um
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
the notion of some lectures being
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
copyrighted uh
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
that very interesting um and again this
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
measure has no zero uh stats
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory policy
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
proposal whatsoever there's no spending
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
proposal again
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's just a
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
request to gather information that might
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
be useful to have one one place
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
in my view
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i i have a uh just
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
pursue one of the areas that was asked
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
of you
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
several years ago the representative
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
sits to my right
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
put in a bill very similar to this
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
videos and audio being taken place in a
 
01:25:08.639 --> 01:25:10.629 align:start position:0%
videos and audio being taken place in a
classroom

01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
it passed legislation i went in the law
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
and within a year there was so much
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
controversy the whole thing had to be
 
01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:18.790 align:start position:0%
controversy the whole thing had to be
rebaked

01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
rebaked
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
um so i i i asked a question if you
 
01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.390 align:start position:0%
um so i i i asked a question if you
haven't

01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
talked with the school boards
 
01:25:26.159 --> 01:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
talked with the school boards
association

01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
they conducted a number of training
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
sessions following this fiasco
 
01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.870 align:start position:0%
sessions following this fiasco
and

01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
policies were developed
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
so that the school districts and schools
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
internally within
 
01:25:42.159 --> 01:25:43.990 align:start position:0%
internally within
can

01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
deal with the issues of confidentiality
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
deal with the issues of special
 
01:25:47.679 --> 01:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
deal with the issues of special
education

01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
deal with all those issues dealing with
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
family life
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
and the idiot the all the
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh areas that and the ramifications of
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
that that can up and end up in the
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
courtroom which are very very real
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
so um you're asking that this developed
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
policies may be submitted
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
would you not think it's a good idea
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
that we first
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
go and check and find out what the has
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
as a result of that
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
you know affair we went through find out
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
what policies are placed
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
and then move forward
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question carmen i
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
think that's exactly what this bill the
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is is to uh you know
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
see what's out there what's what's done
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
what's been done uh what the issues are
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
um i know initially with the gifted bill
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh there was a tendency for some to get
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
down in the weeds and say what about
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
this or we define this or about this and
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
and that bill
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
finally which is now law
 
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.629 align:start position:0%
finally which is now law
um

01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
i i kept saying we the intent of that
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
bill or this bill is not to get down in
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
the weeds uh like i'm hearing a little
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
bit here about what about
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
previous statues and previous
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
experiences this bill proposes nothing
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
in the way of policy nothing in the way
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
of spending we don't want to get down in
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
the weeds we just the intent of this is
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
just simply to
 
01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:15.830 align:start position:0%
just simply to
facilitate

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
sharing of
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
issues best practices policies
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
approaches concerns in a central
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
location for anyone to look at
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
so i think the intent of this kind of
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
answers your question about uh
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
looking at my follow-up question to you
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh is that
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
what you're asking for was the result of
 
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
that process that we went through and
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
the to gather policies come up with
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
policy which would respect we had for
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
example instructors coming out of the
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
post-secondary institution wanting to
 
01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.070 align:start position:0%
post-secondary institution wanting to
take

01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
pictures of of kids
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
the student teachers in the classroom
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
but then there was the issue that we had
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
one student in the classroom that had an
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
iep and that you know was confidential
 
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.590 align:start position:0%
iep and that you know was confidential
information

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
and and and how that was being done at
 
01:28:04.159 --> 01:28:05.669 align:start position:0%
and and and how that was being done at
that

01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
so then that kind of puts a wrinkle on
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
that all these
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
issues were taken into account and
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
policies were the result so i would
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
encourage you to
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
talk with the school boards association
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
and find out
 
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
obtain those policies and the process
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
that went through i sat in a many many
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
of those meetings over there were all
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
districts were participating in
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
communicating and trying to come up with
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do here is come up
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
with what's the best practice for
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
policies i think that's already out
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
there but you know it's up to you to
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
pursue but i would encourage you please
 
01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:43.510 align:start position:0%
pursue but i would encourage you please
to

01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
contact them
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you mr chair for that
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
question and comment and again as i said
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
earlier you know whatever happened uh
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
a year and years ago
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
preceded the covid uh the covid pandemic
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
is a this is prompted largely by the
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
covert pandemic which is new
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
i emphasize um that the intent of this
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
is not to get into any specific issue
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
the intent of this as i said a couple of
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
gather or what's out there and no
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
district needs to uh
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
share anything if they don't want to i
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a request
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
for doe to establish a folder and and
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
ask request
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
policies that districts are willing to
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
to share we don't want to get into any
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
at this point we just want information
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
we don't want to touch on any specific
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh thing other than
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
to ask schools to share with what they
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
what they have represented ellison
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
my question uh specifically on the
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
classroom observer policies
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
you talked about kind of
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
what would be included in that uh i
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
guess i understand the the sort of the
 
01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.390 align:start position:0%
guess i understand the the sort of the
way

01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
a policy that a school district has
 
01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.070 align:start position:0%
a policy that a school district has
might

01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
relate to general the general public or
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
to parents
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
you also seem to include
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
classroom observer
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
policies that relate to teacher
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
evaluation i mean every every single
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
school district and a lot of this is
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
written in the contract as there will be
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
x number of visits by your
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
administration and the first year
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
teachers will get this and the third
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
year teachers will get that you you
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
really want all that information from
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
every single school district put into
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
this file sure i think in my comments
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
that i put out to everybody uh i might
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
have mentioned in in terms of observers
 
01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.750 align:start position:0%
have mentioned in in terms of observers
um

01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
every school is different uh some have
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
more in the way of definition policies
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
than others and representative wood
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
caucus i keep hearing you as a principal
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i've been out there too so
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of classroom observation uh
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's not part of the the bill it's
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
very brief but my comments to you all to
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
or my testimony with regard to classroom
 
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.189 align:start position:0%
or my testimony with regard to classroom
observers

01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
observers
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
i just pointed out that uh principals i
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
believe you know are expected
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
to observe teachers
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh so they announced visits or
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
unannounced uh that's what somebody had
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me when we were working on
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
the language
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
the reason that we tie in the observer
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
piece of this
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
in the actual 1295
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
observing classes
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
we're in a a new world i don't know if
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's a brave new world but um
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
if classes through the pandemic have
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
been observed by parents remotely
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
then the question comes up
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know once we hopefully get back to a
 
01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:00.229 align:start position:0%
you know once we hopefully get back to a
classroom

01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
01:32:00.239 --> 01:32:01.510 align:start position:0%
classroom
uh

01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know brick and mortar building
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
classroom type deal and it's no longer
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
remote some parents uh may have enjoyed
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
or been pulled in or care about the
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
instruction and some of them i know
 
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.270 align:start position:0%
instruction and some of them i know
miss

01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
miss
 
01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.229 align:start position:0%
miss
uh

01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
the chance to see what
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
what the classes are doing and so some
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
of them if they want to visit in person
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh as a practical matter you know you
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
can only have so many and again we're
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
not suggesting any policy but if
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
if like what's happening here
 
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:34.550 align:start position:0%
if like what's happening here
um

01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
um
perhaps

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
if schools can afford to or if there's
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
certain classes that uh more
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
amenable to recording
 
01:32:43.199 --> 01:32:44.070 align:start position:0%
amenable to recording
uh

01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
you know should this happen in class
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
classes i i don't know i am that's the
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
type of information that i think d.o.e
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
and others are interested in
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
what's out there what's being done um
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
does that kind of address your question
 
01:32:58.239 --> 01:32:59.350 align:start position:0%
does that kind of address your question
hopefully

01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
just so i'm clear
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
it would be your expectation or you
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
would hope
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
that every school district would provide
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
its policies for classroom observation
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
by administrators for determining tenure
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
for teachers whether they're going to be
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
rehired because that's that seems to me
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
comes under classroom observer policy
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
sure yeah i thank you for the question
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh again um i left my bill over there at
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
my notes here but uh the the bill does
 
01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.870 align:start position:0%
my notes here but uh the the bill does
doesn't

01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.629 align:start position:0%
doesn't
yeah

01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh teacher evaluation that
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
type of observation the bill doesn't get
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
into that at all
 
01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.350 align:start position:0%
into that at all
uh

01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's a very broad uh bill just asking
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
what policies are out there for
 
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.950 align:start position:0%
what policies are out there for
observation

01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
observation
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
in my again in my comments to you i just
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
threw out that
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
some parents want to sit in
 
01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:51.910 align:start position:0%
some parents want to sit in
uh

01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
administrators i think are supposed to
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
at some point do an announcement or an
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
unannounced visit that's not part of the
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill that's just stuff that's out there
 
01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.030 align:start position:0%
bill that's just stuff that's out there
that

01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
that is part of
 
01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.390 align:start position:0%
that is part of
the

01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
classroom observer issue
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
but that's not part of the the bill just
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
again just
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
asks what's what's being done and and um
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
let us know
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
what you're doing and
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
if you would so that we can have that
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
best practices folder to
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
to look at represent thank you
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
brother i just have a couple of
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
follow-ups a moment ago in the i'm sure
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
the youtube tape that's been recorded
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
we'll document this uh you said that all
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do is you would just
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
ask the superintendents what they had
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
and they could send it in
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
your bill on line four says they shall
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a question just ask
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent what are you doing it
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
says they shall do it the superintendent
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
which is distinctly different than just
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
asking if it's okay to do it which is
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
sort of the impression you gave at least
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
from my assumption as i listen to you
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
dialogues that concerns me
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
the second one is um
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure almost every every school
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
i've been involved with has a
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
a boilerplate it's not a hand-crafted
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
policy that deals with
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
visitors in the building visiting the
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
classroom et cetera et cetera
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned
 
01:35:15.119 --> 01:35:16.310 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned
and

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't i wouldn't use the word
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
devious because i don't think that's the
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
type of person you are but i'm concerned
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
at least not generally but i'm concerned
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a backdoor
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
reference to a lot of the dialogue that
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
we heard of the committee last week
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
earlier this week as regards school
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
boards and limitations and parents and
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
visitations and access
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
and i hope that that's not what this is
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
but that but that raises my concern just
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
because of the timing
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah sure
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you represent woodcock for your
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
two questions the first one had to do
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
with with shao yes again to my earlier
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
points about this being statute and from
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature uh to to show that this
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
is something that needs attention and
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
so yes that's why we want something in
 
01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.990 align:start position:0%
so yes that's why we want something in
statute

01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
and in terms of visitor policies uh
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
again there is no proposal here and you
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
make the great point that these visitor
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
policies presumably i'm sure exist in
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
most schools and if if there are some
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
schools that don't have a visitor policy
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
or they don't have a good one or they
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
need to update one if this measure
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
provides some impetus for a few schools
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
to pay to look at something that needs
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
attention and that
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think is a good thing um in terms of
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know a nefarious intent
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
again you have a lot of the language
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
there it's like the gifted bill it's
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
very short i consider it sweet uh just a
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
way to um engage
 
01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:47.830 align:start position:0%
way to um engage
uh

01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
school districts on what i think what
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
many of us think is an area that just
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
needs some attention and
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
discussion and and
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
again no specific uh agenda or policy
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
piece other than to just get this on
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
people's school districts radar screens
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh like we thought the gifted
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
issue should be more on more radar
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
screens and now it is and i think many
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
many good things are coming from that
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
and again i know i keep comparing the
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
two but one template the initial
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
template i think is the same template
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
for this i think the gifted measure
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
put that on radar screens and a lot of
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
good is coming from that and i see we
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
see a need for this to get some
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
attention and by having a modest statue
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
just creating a folder i think
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
would do that
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
quickly just a comment thank you
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.709 align:start position:0%
i would say
schools

01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
particularly after the multiple
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
shootings across the country
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the last decade have done a vigorous
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
job and an in-depth job of preparing
 
01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.430 align:start position:0%
job and an in-depth job of preparing
visitor

01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
visitor
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
policies in classroom policies to
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
respond to that sure so i'm sure that
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
there there are plenty available thank
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
are there reps on nelson another
 
01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:09.510 align:start position:0%
are there reps on nelson another
principal

01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
principal
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman as a former
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
principal and a special ed teacher and a
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
regular aid teacher
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
this i don't know all the background on
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
this i apologize for that but i think
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
from a teacher point of view the issues
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
that i ran as a special ed teacher in
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
the classroom that needed to be
 
01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.229 align:start position:0%
the classroom that needed to be
addressed

01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
that you would never do if there was a
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
camera going
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
indeed some student just says one little
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
thing and you know you need to have to
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
talk to them later or confidentially
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
that concerns me
 
01:38:38.719 --> 01:38:39.910 align:start position:0%
that concerns me
and

01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
as a health in other words would they
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
record a health bed question that's
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
another one teacher was talking about
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
sex ed
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
would you want a camera in that when a
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
student may ask a question that would be
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
embarrassing would students be quiet and
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
so i can't ask anything our kids are
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
going to make fun of me you got a
 
01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.189 align:start position:0%
going to make fun of me you got a
question

01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
good point thank you
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh yes uh
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
you know excellent points and and i
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
again i go back to what's happening here
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh with representative nelson's
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
questions and with representatives
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
questions representing
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
ellison's questions and and
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative tanner's questions and
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative vlad's questions and
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh that's the intent of this is to
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
promulgate or or
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
provide some impetus to address some of
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
these things i don't have a position i
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
have no positions on any of those issues
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
other than you know i think it would be
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
useful to uh
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
bring those forward and if there are
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
existing special ed policies in terms of
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
what you describe
 
01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:45.750 align:start position:0%
what you describe
uh

01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
some schools may have them some may not
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
some have different ones
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
again i i see some of us see of great
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
value to uh d.o.e having a a place to
 
01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
value to uh d.o.e having a a place to
that

01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
that someone can go to
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh who wants to see what's out there
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
what's being done what works what
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't and uh i think only good things
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
can happen when we share
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
best practices or bad practices that
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
didn't work and just
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
you know again i
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of getting in the weeds and
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
your specifics that's not where
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
where i'm at
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
just looking for a folder thank you very
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
much um
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
well we're okay okay
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you who's your intended audience
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
for going to look for this information
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
other superintendents
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
question was uh who is the intended
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
audience for for going looking at this
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
information uh
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
there is no intended audience per se um
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
i think who would this potentially be
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
who would this potentially be of
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
interest to
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think it would be of interest to
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
school boards i think would be of
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
interest to administrators i think it
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
could be interested of interest to
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
parents potentially if the interest
 
01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
of interest to legislators may be
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
if they get
 
01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.950 align:start position:0%
if they get
constituent

01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
queries or requests for
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%

to observation or audio visual recording
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
to know that
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's a place that they could go to
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
that that d.o.e has that they could uh
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
could refer to does that can you answer
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
your question hopefully yeah i just if a
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
constituent asked me i would go to my
 
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.070 align:start position:0%

04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's relative to the best interest of
 
04:02:34.630 --> 04:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
the student for a change of school or
 
04:02:34.640 --> 04:02:36.229 align:start position:0%
the student for a change of school or

04:02:36.229 --> 04:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
assignment
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
and the prime sponsor is not here today
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
so we're having represent boom introduce
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:02:46.150 --> 04:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the record

ralph bowm
 
04:02:49.590 --> 04:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
hillsborough district 20
 
04:02:51.670 --> 04:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
town of litchfield
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
and this bill is like said relative best
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
into the student for a change of school
 
04:02:56.319 --> 04:02:57.750 align:start position:0%
into the student for a change of school
assignment

04:02:57.750 --> 04:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
assignment
 
04:02:59.910 --> 04:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's fairly simple
 
04:02:59.920 --> 04:03:00.710 align:start position:0%
it's fairly simple
line

04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:03:02.309 --> 04:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
four it says a
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
student's school or assignment the
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent shall consider consider
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
parental concerns
 
04:03:10.870 --> 04:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
and the students academic physical so
 
04:03:13.349 --> 04:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
parental concerns was added
 
04:03:15.750 --> 04:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
and then line 13
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
it says or do students transfer to a
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
public school or public academy in the
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so those are the
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
changes to current law which is 193
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
colon 3 1 e and f
 
04:03:29.359 --> 04:03:30.630 align:start position:0%
colon 3 1 e and f
so

04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much it
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
are there any other people that have
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
pink cards for this um are there any
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
questions for represent boom i'm sure
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
you know he's not the author of the
 
04:04:05.110 --> 04:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking naively
 
04:04:09.429 --> 04:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
does this affect them how are they
 
04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:16.150 --> 04:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
when you specify in new hampshire
 
04:04:17.910 --> 04:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire students in new
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire public schools but i mean if
 
04:04:21.990 --> 04:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
one of those new hampshire schools is
 
04:04:24.150 --> 04:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
going across to maine or someplace like
 
04:04:24.160 --> 04:04:25.110 align:start position:0%
going across to maine or someplace like
that

04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
is there any adjustment for that
 
04:04:30.790 --> 04:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
i don't believe if they're in a
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
at school in another state then they're
 
04:04:33.359 --> 04:04:34.710 align:start position:0%
at school in another state then they're
not

04:04:34.710 --> 04:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know how that works it might be
 
04:04:41.269 --> 04:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
just my ignorance
 
04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.110 --> 04:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
i i i just can give you a a would
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe that we do
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
have schools that are approved schools
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
that that are approved schools
 
04:04:58.479 --> 04:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
that that are approved schools
that

04:04:59.990 --> 04:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
are not located in this state
 
04:05:06.070 --> 04:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm referencing the
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
schools in fairly vermont which are part
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
of the school district which is an inter
 
04:05:11.439 --> 04:05:12.309 align:start position:0%
of the school district which is an inter
state

04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
school district
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
so it's possible that a superintendent
 
04:05:18.870 --> 04:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
could place the kids in an elementary
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
school in fairly vermont
 
04:05:22.080 --> 04:05:23.110 align:start position:0%
school in fairly vermont
um

04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
i i don't know why not i don't know if
 
04:05:28.150 --> 04:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
this legislation allows that
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm looking to see if it says
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
public school
 
04:05:37.269 --> 04:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
transfer to another public school
 
04:05:39.670 --> 04:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
within the district residence
 
04:05:42.150 --> 04:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
so it means somebody
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
in the budding school district and would
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
you believe that would be the the person
 
04:05:47.830 --> 04:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
in the budding district like the one i'm
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
living in right now which
 
04:05:51.510 --> 04:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
it has been done in the past
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh could that occur now i don't know
 
04:05:56.150 --> 04:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
yeah but the new the item number four
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
says the student transfer public school
 
04:06:00.150 --> 04:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
or public academy in the state of new
 
04:06:02.150 --> 04:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
i would think in that case what you
 
04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned it probably could put it to
 
04:06:07.750 --> 04:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
another public school in new hampshire
 
04:06:09.750 --> 04:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
rather than in in
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
04:06:13.110 --> 04:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i don't know we don't get a
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
debate going on here right now
 
04:06:15.279 --> 04:06:16.710 align:start position:0%
debate going on here right now
woodcock

04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman i'm looking at uh
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
item four as representative
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
bowman just identified
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
the preceding
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
line item 3 on lines 11 and 12
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
says exactly the same thing
 
04:06:36.389 --> 04:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
except for it limits to new hampshire
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
and that would then
 
04:06:40.469 --> 04:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
exempt the school that you're talking
 
04:06:43.269 --> 04:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
about on the board of states
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes if the
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
district yes my question is why would
 
04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
you want to refer for a continuous town
 
04:06:49.760 --> 04:06:50.630 align:start position:0%
you want to refer for a continuous town
like

04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:06:53.269 --> 04:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
up north or havel or down south by where
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
all the
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
schools are on the rockingham county or
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
up north
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's not your bill i don't know i
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't know i mean the thing is line
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
three is different than line four nine
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
three is
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
an approved school in another district i
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't see that much different between
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
line three and four myself
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah line four just specifies that it
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
has to be in the state right without
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
line four then representative ladd
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
concerned for a contiguous sound over
 
04:07:25.110 --> 04:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
the border would be okay
 
04:07:27.269 --> 04:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
so this this eliminates the opportunity
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
to move uh approve school
 
04:07:32.309 --> 04:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
well except it says or so i don't even
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
know why this line is in here
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
because the previous line
 
04:07:39.429 --> 04:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
does cover another district in the state
 
04:07:42.309 --> 04:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so and since it says or
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
not and
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
the line three still exists and line
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
three covers everything that would be
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
covered in line four
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
for purposes of the committee right now
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
i have no other pink cards in this
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
and so we're really talking amongst
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves and that's okay we'll allow
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
that to happen seeing that prime
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor's not here maybe we can save a
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
little time if we start to talk this
 
04:08:06.389 --> 04:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
thing out a little bit
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
and and and maybe uh can you know each
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
of us come to some you know idea where
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
we are on it
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
so let's just open it up for just
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
general discussion
 
04:08:17.590 --> 04:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see anybody back there that's
 
04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
got a pink car so
 
04:08:22.950 --> 04:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
so representative mullen
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
so it looks to me like if we add four
 
04:08:28.469 --> 04:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
we're actually adding a restriction
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
opening it up it was open
 
04:08:33.760 --> 04:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
opening it up it was open
in

04:08:34.630 --> 04:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:08:36.710 --> 04:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
number three
 
04:08:39.030 --> 04:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
right transfer to public school public
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
academy or
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
private school in another district
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
yes period so that could be new
 
04:08:47.349 --> 04:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire that could be vermont that
 
04:08:52.149 --> 04:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
can i so why do we need i guess my
 
04:08:57.269 --> 04:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
question is why do we need to specify
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
it still doesn't resolve the interstate
 
04:09:23.040 --> 04:09:24.309 align:start position:0%
it still doesn't resolve the interstate
district

04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
or interstate governmental agreement
 
04:09:28.149 --> 04:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
which we have which is a district which
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
is on both sides
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
and the high schools on one side
 
04:09:36.070 --> 04:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
the grade schools are on the other side
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
of the river
 
04:09:37.600 --> 04:09:38.550 align:start position:0%
of the river
so

04:09:38.550 --> 04:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:39.750 --> 04:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
wanting to place this student
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
if in sau 23 which is just within
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
five miles of this if an agreement is
 
04:09:51.269 --> 04:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
made could that superintendent of s823
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
say i'm going to place this child in the
 
04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
fairly school which is part of the
 
04:09:55.600 --> 04:09:56.710 align:start position:0%
fairly school which is part of the
rivendell

04:09:56.710 --> 04:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
rivendell
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
school district which is an approved
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
district in the state of new hampshire
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
but the school is not located in new
 
04:10:02.159 --> 04:10:06.229 align:start position:0%
but the school is not located in new
hampshire

04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at it and it does fall
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
through the cracks
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
and if instead
 
04:10:11.680 --> 04:10:15.510 align:start position:0%
and if instead
in

04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:17.110 --> 04:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
in line two
 
04:10:19.349 --> 04:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
instead of saying within the district of
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
residence if you said within the current
 
04:10:21.840 --> 04:10:23.030 align:start position:0%
residence if you said within the current
district

04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
that would include those other schools
 
04:10:27.189 --> 04:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
within the district but which aren't in
 
04:10:29.189 --> 04:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
either the state or the town of
 
04:10:29.199 --> 04:10:30.389 align:start position:0%
either the state or the town of
residence

04:10:30.389 --> 04:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
residence
 
04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
right because they don't reside
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
in vermont but they go to school in
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
vermont now and it would give them the
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
chance to go to another school in
 
04:10:38.239 --> 04:10:39.429 align:start position:0%
chance to go to another school in
vermont

04:10:39.429 --> 04:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:10:43.590 --> 04:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
right now because we either have
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
current assigned school
 
04:10:46.000 --> 04:10:47.269 align:start position:0%
current assigned school
or

04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
district of residence
 
04:10:49.600 --> 04:10:51.189 align:start position:0%
district of residence
or

04:10:51.189 --> 04:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
um another district but what if it's the
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
same district but you but
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know how they define distributed
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
residents and having a kid go to another
 
04:11:03.189 --> 04:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
school in vermont that i don't want
 
04:11:05.590 --> 04:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
but if it's a school district which is
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
approved by our department of education
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
which has a school in that other state
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
then that that particular school should
 
04:11:12.720 --> 04:11:13.910 align:start position:0%
then that that particular school should
be

04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:11:15.510 --> 04:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
a place where you could put a child well
 
04:11:16.870 --> 04:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's what i meant if there's two
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
schools in vermont in the same district
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
and all they want to do is move them
 
04:11:22.149 --> 04:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
from one school to another
 
04:11:24.309 --> 04:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
in the same district there's only one
 
04:11:25.830 --> 04:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
elementary oh there is only but there
 
04:11:27.670 --> 04:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
might be in maine i don't know in one of
 
04:11:31.110 --> 04:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
these borderlands if you had two towns
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
two schools
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
across the border in the same district
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
somehow you want to make sure they can
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
just move them from
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
one district one school building to the
 
04:11:40.000 --> 04:11:41.110 align:start position:0%
one district one school building to the
other

04:11:41.110 --> 04:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is a big enough issue
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
to really you know spend a lot of time
 
04:11:44.319 --> 04:11:45.269 align:start position:0%
to really you know spend a lot of time
on

04:11:45.269 --> 04:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
but it's a little confusing
 
04:11:49.590 --> 04:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
i just i do have to i just laughing over
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
here representative lad that i notice
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
that you and representative nelson are
 
04:11:52.560 --> 04:11:56.070 align:start position:0%
that you and representative nelson are
co-sponsors

04:11:56.070 --> 04:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
yeah see i beli you know i thought the
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
the bill had the top part in it uh you
 
04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
know and consider parental concerns
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
i know i've signed a lot of things i
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
don't know what i signed on that you've
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
or you could be like me and sign on to
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
things that you don't even like because
 
04:12:18.309 --> 04:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
they tell you well you can amend it
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
rep sam moffitt
 
04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair um
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools is not mentioned
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere here and i'll bring it up
 
04:12:27.990 --> 04:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
before somebody else does uh
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
should chart public charter schools be
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:40.399 --> 04:12:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:12:41.110 --> 04:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
i've always been an impression a charter
 
04:12:44.950 --> 04:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
school is a public school
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
so public school
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
is here so does this
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i know you signed on to this but
 
04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:58.319 --> 04:12:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:12:59.110 --> 04:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know but seriously i uh
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
public charter schools often times in
 
04:13:07.110 --> 04:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
these measures they have both public
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
school or public charter school and this
 
04:13:10.870 --> 04:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
has public school but not public charter
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
school so i mean that's something that
 
04:13:13.439 --> 04:13:14.870 align:start position:0%
school so i mean that's something that
uh

04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
i think in a chartered school
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lottery to get into and i don't
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
think a
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
school district can just tell
 
04:13:26.070 --> 04:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
put a kid in the charter school because
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
right because it's the lottery but and
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
somebody that's in a chartered school
 
04:13:33.990 --> 04:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
they can just leave
 
04:13:35.590 --> 04:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with this manifest education
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
bill so many times over represent
 
04:13:42.550 --> 04:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
cornell and it also says the
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent will do and there's no
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
superintendent of a charter school it's
 
04:13:48.550 --> 04:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
the board of trustees so the
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
superintendent wouldn't have anything to
 
04:13:53.269 --> 04:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
do with the charter school
 
04:13:53.279 --> 04:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
do with the charter school
right

04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and and this may be that internal
 
04:14:00.630 --> 04:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
move too i'd have to look at the whole
 
04:14:02.309 --> 04:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
bill here it could be the superintendent
 
04:14:04.469 --> 04:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
and the district can transfer from a
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
school in manchester to another school
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:14.950 --> 04:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
they do it all the time especially when
 
04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
you're transferring an athlete that's
 
04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:25.110 --> 04:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
hey you can't tell me that stuff doesn't
 
04:14:27.990 --> 04:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
happen not new not manchester united
 
04:14:28.000 --> 04:14:29.110 align:start position:0%
happen not new not manchester united
okay

04:14:29.110 --> 04:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm sure it happens up in conway
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
reps of woodcock do you have a question
 
04:14:35.110 --> 04:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
i i do
 
04:14:37.110 --> 04:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
twice today i agree with representative
 
04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
um i i think i think that the the
 
04:14:41.590 --> 04:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
charter school has a separate enrollment
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
procedure and you just as you said you
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
just can't place them in there as well
 
04:14:46.710 --> 04:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:14:50.149 --> 04:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
is there any need we going for the the
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
prep sponsor's not here we're having fun
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:56.560 --> 04:14:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
reps and nelson
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
my question is my grandson
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
was having not difficulties but not
 
04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
happy at a school in beau
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
he then
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
went to he's in a charter school down in
 
04:15:11.439 --> 04:15:13.189 align:start position:0%
went to he's in a charter school down in
salem

04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
salem
 
04:15:15.110 --> 04:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
now how does that all get paid for and
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.510 --> 04:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay just from the state
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
home school could be happy for the
 
04:15:35.429 --> 04:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
so i think we will address this later on
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
when we take an exec if you really have
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
some heartburn on this thing do some
 
04:15:41.279 --> 04:15:44.550 align:start position:0%
some heartburn on this thing do some
research

04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.870 --> 04:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
like the yellow too
 
04:15:46.880 --> 04:15:47.830 align:start position:0%
like the yellow too
okay

04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
so there's no pink cards from anybody
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
here in the public
 
04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of vacancy out there
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay so with that we're
 
04:15:57.600 --> 04:15:58.790 align:start position:0%
okay so with that we're
representing

04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
representing
 
04:16:01.110 --> 04:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
just one last question uh not a if i may
 
04:16:03.189 --> 04:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
since we're not in that mode uh i'll
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
point out that there are 14 people uh
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%

04:16:07.920 --> 04:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
watching on youtube this session just
just

04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%

04:16:10.550 --> 04:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
so i hope they're having as much fun as
 
04:16:12.790 --> 04:16:12.800 align:start position:0%

thank you very much we are ready to go
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
ahead with the 130 hearing today
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh our 1 30 hearing is on hb 1672
 
04:31:27.429 --> 04:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
relative to misuse of education freedom
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
account funds and i i welcome the prime
 
04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair members of
 
04:31:37.830 --> 04:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:31:41.229 --> 04:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
dave luno here to introduce house bill
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
1672. i represent the
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
people in merrimack county district 10
 
04:31:49.189 --> 04:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
which are the folks who live in
 
04:31:50.830 --> 04:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
hopkinton and the western part of
 
04:31:53.110 --> 04:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
concord um
 
04:31:57.110 --> 04:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
so house bill 1672 is very similar
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
to a bill that
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
that we heard i believe it was last week
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 1355
 
04:32:07.670 --> 04:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
relative to um to preventing fraud
 
04:32:10.630 --> 04:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
from uh from occurring uh uh within the
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh education freedom account uh program
 
04:32:16.389 --> 04:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh however the difference between 1672
 
04:32:19.910 --> 04:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
and 1355 is that 1672 is is more
 
04:32:19.920 --> 04:32:21.750 align:start position:0%
and 1355 is that 1672 is is more
comprehensive

04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh than uh than that other bill it um
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
in addition to um
 
04:32:30.309 --> 04:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
to the fraud prevention
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh provisions uh in uh in 1355
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
1672 does two additional things that i
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
think are very important uh it improves
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
the integrity of the education freedom
 
04:32:44.149 --> 04:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
account program
 
04:32:46.950 --> 04:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
and it has a layer of accountability
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
um uh in the um
 
04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
in the language
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that
 
04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
would be used to um
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um uh that that any
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
that you know incidents of fraud are not
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
only detected but um but are are
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
prevented from being able to uh to
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
persist within the program
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
so um so what i'd like to do is is just
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
spend a couple minutes going through the
 
04:33:15.990 --> 04:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill very quickly and then and then i'd
 
04:33:17.429 --> 04:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
be happy to
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
to take um to take questions on it the
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
first three sections of the um of the
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill on page one i would really lump
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
into the program integrity category
 
04:33:33.990 --> 04:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
first of all it um it
 
04:33:36.470 --> 04:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
it it does uh
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
it does address some student eligibility
 
04:33:39.840 --> 04:33:40.709 align:start position:0%
it does address some student eligibility
and

04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
and and if
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
for a uh for an education freedom
 
04:33:48.310 --> 04:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
account to remain in force
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
the the student would have to continue
 
04:33:52.390 --> 04:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for the program so
 
04:33:54.150 --> 04:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
ineligible students
 
04:33:54.160 --> 04:33:55.670 align:start position:0%
ineligible students
would

04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
would mean that the education freedom
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
account terminates
 
04:33:59.439 --> 04:34:00.150 align:start position:0%
account terminates
and

04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
enrolling as a full-time student
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
in a in the resident district public
 
04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
school would actually cause
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
cause the student to be ineligible and
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
would term term terminate sorry the
 
04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
education freedom account
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
as opposed to putting on hold the efa
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh the the existing language in the bill
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
which is uh which is uh crossed out and
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm now looking at lines sort of 8
 
04:34:26.869 --> 04:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
through 12
 
04:34:28.709 --> 04:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
would would prevent the state from
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
continuing to make deposits into the efa
 
04:34:33.029 --> 04:34:33.039 align:start position:0%
but the student's family would continue
 
04:34:35.189 --> 04:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to make withdrawals from the
 
04:34:35.199 --> 04:34:36.390 align:start position:0%
to be able to make withdrawals from the
efa

04:34:36.390 --> 04:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
efa
 
04:34:36.400 --> 04:34:37.429 align:start position:0%
efa
for

04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
for approved educational expenses even
 
04:34:41.189 --> 04:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
if they were attending their public
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
school so uh so we feel that's a that's
 
04:34:45.429 --> 04:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
a conflict with the program
 
04:34:47.429 --> 04:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
and uh it is a good change
 
04:34:49.590 --> 04:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
in the name of program integrity
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
04:34:55.830 --> 04:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
the um the accountability section
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
really begins on on on section 4
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh line 21.
 
04:35:01.199 --> 04:35:03.830 align:start position:0%
uh line 21.
and

04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
and what this does is um is
 
04:35:09.429 --> 04:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
the well it sort of doesn't do this in
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
order but the the uh
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
the first thing it does down in the down
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
on line 29
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
is um is require the scholarship
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
organization shall refer suspected cases
 
04:35:24.150 --> 04:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
of substantial misuse of efa funds to
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
the attorney general for investigation
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
so very much similar to house bill 1355
 
04:35:32.789 --> 04:35:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh replaces the word may with shall
 
04:35:34.949 --> 04:35:34.959 align:start position:0%
relies on the attorney general's office
 
04:35:38.310 --> 04:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
to um to do any investigation
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
but it does actually retain the word
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
substantial misuse which i think was one
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
of the uh one of the concerns that
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh brought up
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:35:50.949 --> 04:35:50.959 align:start position:0%
and so uh so we keep that we do uh
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
remove the intentional
 
04:35:54.869 --> 04:35:54.879 align:start position:0%
uh part because really that's part of an
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
investigation that would be uh
 
04:35:58.470 --> 04:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know would be conducted by the
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:07.109 --> 04:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
and then um and then on page uh page two
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
um really it's part of the
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
accountability process i'm sorry part of
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
the accountability the bill is actually
 
04:36:16.150 --> 04:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
the process that's used
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
so um so an efa student being able to
 
04:36:19.119 --> 04:36:20.551 align:start position:0%
so um so an efa student being able to
appeal

04:36:20.551 --> 04:36:20.561 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
a a decision to deny eligibility to the
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
state board
 
04:36:28.390 --> 04:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
a process that um
 
04:36:28.400 --> 04:36:29.590 align:start position:0%
a process that um
that

04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:37.750 --> 04:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
information that is substantially
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
misrepresented uh or failed to refund
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
any overpayments in a timely manner
 
04:36:43.830 --> 04:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the words intentionally
 
04:36:43.840 --> 04:36:44.869 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the words intentionally
there

04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and then uh how about halfway
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
down page two uh the department shall
 
04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
adopt rules and do rulemaking
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh for uh for the administration of this
 
04:36:57.990 --> 04:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
chapter and really take that out of the
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the scholarship
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
organization it's really the department
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
of education that that should determine
 
04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh the rules behind
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
the efa program so that's what the bill
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
does again it's about
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
accountability and program integrity
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's more comprehensive than the one we
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
we looked at uh last week i don't think
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
you need both bills but both to improve
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the program with respect to
 
04:37:28.230 --> 04:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
the determination of fraudulent use of
 
04:37:31.670 --> 04:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money which obviously we're all
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
uh looking after to make sure that
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money isn't uh isn't isn't um
 
04:37:41.189 --> 04:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
isn't used fraudulently so thank you
 
04:37:43.349 --> 04:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very much president
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
04:37:49.189 --> 04:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:51.990 --> 04:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative cornell thank you um
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question in two
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
places i think you changed from and you
 
04:37:58.150 --> 04:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
may have talked about this and i missed
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
it you changed from department to state
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
board of education
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's really really really
 
04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
a technical correction uh it's the same
 
04:38:08.310 --> 04:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
thing but the state board of education
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
could you please explain to me that your
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
your purpose for
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh where you've uh
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
struck out the word intentional
 
04:38:25.109 --> 04:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
several times throughout the bill right
 
04:38:27.029 --> 04:38:27.039 align:start position:0%
could you explain the rationale between
 
04:38:30.070 --> 04:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
just you know keeping that with the
 
04:38:32.551 --> 04:38:32.561 align:start position:0%
substantially or or
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
why you've done this yeah no that's a
 
04:38:35.590 --> 04:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's a great question thank you very
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
much mr chair the um the word
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
intentional is really
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
really a determination of law
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
as opposed to um substance and i think
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization's in a
 
04:38:46.799 --> 04:38:47.830 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization's in a
position

04:38:47.830 --> 04:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
where where it can determine whether or
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
not um whether or not something that
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
that that could that might be considered
 
04:38:55.439 --> 04:38:56.551 align:start position:0%
that that could that might be considered
fraud

04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
04:38:58.230 --> 04:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
they don't know for sure
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
but possibly it's considered fraud and
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
it does have have substance to it so the
 
04:39:03.920 --> 04:39:05.269 align:start position:0%
it does have have substance to it so the
substantial

04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
04:39:08.551 --> 04:39:08.561 align:start position:0%
uh part of it but determining intent is
 
04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
something that i think is pretty pretty
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
complex it's um and i think we heard
 
04:39:17.429 --> 04:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
some some testimony during 1355
 
04:39:19.750 --> 04:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
the differences between intent and
 
04:39:19.760 --> 04:39:20.949 align:start position:0%
the differences between intent and
substantive

04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959 align:start position:0%
substantive
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
and that some substantive is something
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
that could be quantified intent is
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
really a a sort of a finding of law i
 
04:39:28.160 --> 04:39:29.109 align:start position:0%
really a a sort of a finding of law i
guess

04:39:29.109 --> 04:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
guess
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
and um and the department of justice
 
04:39:32.629 --> 04:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
would be in a much better position to be
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
able to make that determination
 
04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
than um
 
04:39:38.550 --> 04:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
than the scholarship organization
 
04:39:42.788 --> 04:39:42.798 align:start position:0%

04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
that yet it's going to be in
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%

04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
to make doctors appointments yeah so
 
04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it'd be nice if we really knew all
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
this yeah
 
04:46:11.750 --> 04:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay let me call and find out i don't
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%

that's fine yeah i think it works all
 
04:46:56.788 --> 04:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%

and and and the
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
chairmanship does not rotate
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%

04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:36.718 --> 04:47:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
190.

04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:10.230 --> 04:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
initial meeting is taught by the first
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%

elect a chair
 
04:48:22.868 --> 04:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right why don't we just
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
leave it at that yeah that's fine
 
04:48:26.788 --> 04:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
yeah it wouldn't be in this book because
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:44.080 --> 04:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.360 --> 04:49:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
automatically

04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
04:49:35.120 --> 04:49:35.670 align:start position:0%
automatically
no if they're in

04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
no if they're in
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
be in the legislation because um
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
it is in other
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
study committees do you have verbiage
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
for it
 
04:49:46.628 --> 04:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
all of us can just put instead i got it
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
right here in front of me
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
legislative members
 
04:49:53.110 --> 04:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
shall receive mileage
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
when attending two duties
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
should we have
 
04:50:29.840 --> 04:50:32.948 align:start position:0%
should we have
uh

04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe um
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
a member from uh house finance
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
i think but see this is a puzzle
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and this is also policy yeah yeah
 
04:50:48.070 --> 04:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't think we need to be i
 
04:50:50.470 --> 04:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't think we have to go there no no i
 
04:50:53.670 --> 04:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:53.830 --> 04:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:53.840 --> 04:57:42.310 align:start position:0%

uh

05:03:07.830 --> 05:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:07.840 --> 05:18:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:18:01.110 --> 05:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:01.120 --> 05:18:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
hello house education committee good to
 
05:18:07.990 --> 05:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
see you again and thank you for the
 
05:18:10.470 --> 05:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce this bill
 
05:18:12.150 --> 05:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
my name is representative tony lebranch
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
and i represent the town of amherst
 
05:18:16.230 --> 05:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
i come before you today to introduce
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
house bill 1381 which would change the
 
05:18:20.708 --> 05:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
current rsa relating to student school
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
board members
 
05:18:24.310 --> 05:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
currently the rsa simply is permissive
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
language allowing for boards to have one
 
05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
or more high school student
 
05:18:27.440 --> 05:18:28.708 align:start position:0%
or more high school student
representatives

05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
if the board opts in
 
05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is make
 
05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
this common practice across the state
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
increase representation to one student
 
05:18:38.470 --> 05:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative per high school
 
05:18:39.590 --> 05:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
every high school has different
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
challenges different needs
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
a perfect example of this is my town in
 
05:18:46.390 --> 05:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
amherst uh what souhegan deals with as
 
05:18:48.868 --> 05:18:48.878 align:start position:0%
compared to nashville school district or
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know even
 
05:18:51.120 --> 05:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
you know even
north

05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
north
 
05:18:53.430 --> 05:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
every school is different every school
 
05:18:56.070 --> 05:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
has different needs different culture
 
05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important that these
 
05:19:00.070 --> 05:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
schools are represented
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
currently they can alternate or have
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
more than one representative but
 
05:19:06.310 --> 05:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
i know nashville specifically
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
opted to have these representatives
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
alternate every single year but that
 
05:19:11.510 --> 05:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
still means
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
every year one school goes
 
05:19:13.280 --> 05:19:15.670 align:start position:0%
every year one school goes
underrepresented

05:19:15.670 --> 05:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
underrepresented
 
05:19:17.430 --> 05:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
having a representative from each school
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
would allow for a more complete picture
 
05:19:20.788 --> 05:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
of what the district is dealing with
 
05:19:22.788 --> 05:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
which is you know what the board deals
 
05:19:22.798 --> 05:19:24.390 align:start position:0%
which is you know what the board deals
with

05:19:24.390 --> 05:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
and in talking to the new hampshire
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
school board association i learned that
 
05:19:28.868 --> 05:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
most districts have opted into the
 
05:19:30.390 --> 05:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
current language
 
05:19:33.030 --> 05:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill and it would not change
 
05:19:35.030 --> 05:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
anything and just simply make this a
 
05:19:36.868 --> 05:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
standardized statewide
 
05:19:36.878 --> 05:19:37.670 align:start position:0%
standardized statewide
norm

05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
norm
 
05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
and with that i ask that the committee
 
05:19:41.270 --> 05:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
passed this bill with an ought to pass
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
motion i like to keep my testimony brief
 
05:19:45.750 --> 05:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
and i might defer to the new hampshire
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:55.350 --> 05:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
taking the question and this is sort of
 
05:19:58.868 --> 05:19:58.878 align:start position:0%
deja vu because i was the one that put
 
05:20:00.390 --> 05:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
the original bill in not the original
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill to make it two
 
05:20:03.270 --> 05:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
or more
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh the thing is what
 
05:20:08.230 --> 05:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
this is nice and we've discussed it when
 
05:20:10.070 --> 05:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
about manchester having three schools
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
what do they do and and that's what came
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
up when people let's rotate or whatnot
 
05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to make the
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
boards too high my problem with this is
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
shall versus may why do you have a
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:28.868 --> 05:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
the reason why i changed the may to a
 
05:20:31.040 --> 05:20:31.910 align:start position:0%
the reason why i changed the may to a
show

05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
show
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
was so that every school board that has
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
a high school within it would have a
 
05:20:38.788 --> 05:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
student representative i believe that
 
05:20:40.708 --> 05:20:40.718 align:start position:0%
having a student representative
 
05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
from each of these high schools is
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
important when the board is making
 
05:20:45.510 --> 05:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
decisions to see what is actually
 
05:20:45.520 --> 05:20:46.470 align:start position:0%
decisions to see what is actually
happening

05:20:46.470 --> 05:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:20:47.910 --> 05:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
at the school
 
05:20:49.590 --> 05:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of things
 
05:20:51.670 --> 05:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and voters and even school
 
05:20:52.948 --> 05:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
board members don't even know what's
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
going on
 
05:20:55.510 --> 05:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
at the schools you know
 
05:20:57.910 --> 05:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
i was at the high school i was a high
 
05:20:59.990 --> 05:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
schooler when the vaping epidemic began
 
05:21:01.830 --> 05:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
and you know this administration was
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
blindsided by that
 
05:21:07.350 --> 05:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know leaky ceilings uh no heating in
 
05:21:08.708 --> 05:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
some of the classrooms these are some of
 
05:21:10.628 --> 05:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
the things that i dealt with at souhegan
 
05:21:12.070 --> 05:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
high school
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
luckily we did have a student
 
05:21:13.200 --> 05:21:14.708 align:start position:0%
luckily we did have a student
representative

05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
and you know they have started working
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
on those issues but i believe that it
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
a statewide norm that there is a student
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative on these boards so that
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
we know what's happening in our schools
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
yeah when i did it we had two
 
05:21:30.390 --> 05:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes we had two on ours and we saw laura
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
always had one that's why i did the two
 
05:21:38.230 --> 05:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:21:41.910 --> 05:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
question it said from each high school
 
05:21:44.070 --> 05:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
and as i said manchester does have four
 
05:21:46.310 --> 05:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
high schools and right now i think they
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
rotate they each have a representative
 
05:21:50.310 --> 05:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
but they rotate them and they don't go
 
05:21:52.708 --> 05:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
and and the school board and the
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
students are happy with that setup would
 
05:21:56.548 --> 05:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
they be able to continue doing that or
 
05:21:58.628 --> 05:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
would all four of them
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
have to go every
 
05:22:00.320 --> 05:22:03.270 align:start position:0%
have to go every
meeting

05:22:03.270 --> 05:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:22:04.708 --> 05:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh i knew manchester was one of the
 
05:22:09.910 --> 05:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
concerns i had with this bill but
 
05:22:11.110 --> 05:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
in talking with the new hampshire school
 
05:22:12.708 --> 05:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
board association
 
05:22:14.948 --> 05:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
and talking with representatives from
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
manchester uh to my knowledge currently
 
05:22:19.590 --> 05:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
manchester is planning on consolidating
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
their schools uh so there will be fewer
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
high schools in manchester uh which will
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
mean less representatives and uh
 
05:22:32.310 --> 05:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that it was necessarily
 
05:22:35.990 --> 05:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
a bad thing to have a representative
 
05:22:37.350 --> 05:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
from each high school at every meeting
 
05:22:39.350 --> 05:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
obviously some people can't attend those
 
05:22:40.708 --> 05:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
meetings just like representatives
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes can't attend house sessions
 
05:22:44.868 --> 05:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
i believe it's the same
 
05:22:46.470 --> 05:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
issue here and
 
05:22:47.910 --> 05:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
representatives from each school would
 
05:22:49.830 --> 05:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
be welcome at all the board
 
05:22:49.840 --> 05:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
be welcome at all the board
meetings

05:22:55.270 --> 05:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
05:22:58.948 --> 05:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question and i think the bill
 
05:23:00.788 --> 05:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
is terrific every school should have a
 
05:23:02.948 --> 05:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
school bus should have one of those um
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we're fortunate in sau 9 and conway
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
we have a very active young lady that
 
05:23:10.548 --> 05:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
did a great job uh have you thought or
 
05:23:12.788 --> 05:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
have any dialogue been i see other
 
05:23:13.750 --> 05:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
fellow representatives from this
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
committee on the board have you folks
 
05:23:17.350 --> 05:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
talked at all about having perhaps
 
05:23:19.830 --> 05:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
having allowing the school the student
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
i have had people thank you for the
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
question i have had individuals and
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
other representatives come up to me and
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
talk about having a voting member
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
um the reason i did not include it in
 
05:23:37.110 --> 05:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
05:23:38.470 --> 05:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
uncertainty on whether legally if the
 
05:23:43.030 --> 05:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
individual's below the age of 18 if they
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
can vote on school board matters
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
as they are not registered voters that
 
05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
was one concern brought up to me
 
05:23:52.390 --> 05:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
another concern uh is you know from the
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers having an unelected
 
05:23:54.400 --> 05:23:55.350 align:start position:0%
taxpayers having an unelected
person

05:23:55.350 --> 05:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:23:56.708 --> 05:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
be on the board and making these
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
decisions which
 
05:24:01.990 --> 05:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
i understand that i necessarily don't
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
agree with that but i that's the reason
 
05:24:05.590 --> 05:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to include it in this bill
 
05:24:07.270 --> 05:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps it could be another piece of
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
legislation at a further date but i just
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to at least make it so that there
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
is a student representative from each
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
high school on the boards thank you
 
05:24:17.910 --> 05:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.830 --> 05:24:19.840 align:start position:0%

05:24:30.070 --> 05:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
schools that have public high schools do
 
05:24:33.270 --> 05:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
not currently have a student on the

that to the new hampshire school board

knowledge

05:24:41.270 --> 05:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
i know of no school districts at least
 
05:24:45.270 --> 05:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
in my area that do not have a school

members of the house education committee
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm becky wilson director
 
05:25:22.150 --> 05:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
of governmental relations for the new
 
05:25:24.230 --> 05:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire school boards association we
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative lebranch
 
05:25:27.830 --> 05:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward this bill and
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors of this bill as well for
 
05:25:33.670 --> 05:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
really highlighting the very important
 
05:25:36.150 --> 05:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
topic of student voice and perspective
 
05:25:38.230 --> 05:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
on our local school boards
 
05:25:40.548 --> 05:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
we share the sponsor's
 
05:25:42.548 --> 05:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
feelings that this is a very integral
 
05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
part of gaining
 
05:25:45.910 --> 05:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
the perspective of student body from a
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
number of different buildings across
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
different districts
 
05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
at the table
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
to answer some of the questions that had
 
05:25:54.548 --> 05:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
come up previously we had discussed
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the school boards
 
05:25:58.150 --> 05:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
association supporting this bill we
 
05:26:00.868 --> 05:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
would approve that this idea as long as
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
it was not a voting member of the school
 
05:26:05.830 --> 05:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
board that's to allow boards to handle
 
05:26:07.270 --> 05:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
how they want to have a student
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative on the board
 
05:26:10.788 --> 05:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
and the ways in which those people are
 
05:26:12.628 --> 05:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
either elected by the student body or
 
05:26:14.788 --> 05:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
they're on a rotating basis
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
getting people from different grade
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
levels it's not always the seniors
 
05:26:19.830 --> 05:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily that are sitting on your
 
05:26:22.390 --> 05:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
school boards sometimes it's freshmen so
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
there was some latitude for school
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
boards to think about how they wanted to
 
05:26:29.270 --> 05:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
include these student reps in the
 
05:26:30.868 --> 05:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
conversations that happen at the board
 
05:26:30.878 --> 05:26:31.750 align:start position:0%
conversations that happen at the board
level

05:26:31.750 --> 05:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
the other reason that we would support
 
05:26:35.430 --> 05:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
them not being a voting member are for
 
05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
things like non-public sessions other
 
05:26:39.110 --> 05:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
kinds of meetings that the school board
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
may need to hold where that student
 
05:26:42.628 --> 05:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
would probably not be
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
part of those meetings and it would be
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
difficult to exclude somebody that was a
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
voting member of the board
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of any other
 
05:26:50.638 --> 05:26:51.830 align:start position:0%
in terms of any other
pieces

05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
05:26:53.670 --> 05:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
our delegate assembly each year our
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
membership votes on resolutions that
 
05:26:57.750 --> 05:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
guide our advocacy throughout the year
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
this year we had a number of school
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
boards that brought forward resolutions
 
05:27:03.510 --> 05:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
asking for scholarships to recognize
 
05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
their student school board
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
representatives so we have put that in
 
05:27:07.990 --> 05:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
place at the school boards association
 
05:27:10.230 --> 05:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
this year we have five scholarships for
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
students who have served on the board
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
at some level over the course of their
 
05:27:16.310 --> 05:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
years it is only open obviously to
 
05:27:18.548 --> 05:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
seniors to apply but they could have
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
served any number of times during the
 
05:27:23.190 --> 05:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
four years of high school so
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
we support this bill and i'm happy to
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
05:27:28.470 --> 05:27:28.480 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you ms

wilson for taking my question i'm going
 
05:27:34.558 --> 05:27:35.350 align:start position:0%
wilson for taking my question i'm going
to

05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
ask you the same question that i just
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
asked representative lebranch
 
05:27:42.788 --> 05:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of how many
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
communities that have public high
 
05:27:46.470 --> 05:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
schools do not have student
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
representation on the board
 
05:27:49.590 --> 05:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge thank you for the
 
05:27:51.270 --> 05:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
question to my knowledge there are not
 
05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
any boards do not have some sort of
 
05:27:56.470 --> 05:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
student voice at some level but there
 
05:27:58.868 --> 05:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
may be boards that do not have a person
 
05:28:00.310 --> 05:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
from every single high school in their
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
district that is somehow connected to
 
05:28:04.548 --> 05:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
the board so it could be again that
 
05:28:06.548 --> 05:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
students are participating on a rotating
 
05:28:06.558 --> 05:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
students are participating on a rotating
basis

05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
basis
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
that they have somebody for one semester
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
but perhaps not the other semester or
 
05:28:13.750 --> 05:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
they're asking for that student voice on
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
particular topics but not at every
 
05:28:17.910 --> 05:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
meeting so i don't have a specific
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
number of how many boards never include
 
05:28:20.000 --> 05:28:21.030 align:start position:0%
number of how many boards never include
students

05:28:21.030 --> 05:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:28:21.910 --> 05:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:28:24.230 --> 05:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
official representative on the board but
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
we certainly could get that information
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
for you with at least with our
 
05:28:26.878 --> 05:28:28.310 align:start position:0%
for you with at least with our
membership

05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
membership
 
05:28:29.830 --> 05:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just pretty sure that there's no
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
student on the bedford new hampshire
 
05:28:35.270 --> 05:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
school board
 
05:28:35.280 --> 05:28:36.310 align:start position:0%
school board
so

05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:37.830 --> 05:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
05:28:39.830 --> 05:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
will put that out there as a question
 
05:28:42.628 --> 05:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
could you check for me ms wilson to see
 
05:28:44.948 --> 05:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
whether or not there is uh i just
 
05:28:48.150 --> 05:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
visually there is not and i'm interested
 
05:28:51.190 --> 05:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
in uh what the alternatives for student
 
05:28:52.788 --> 05:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
input are
 
05:28:54.868 --> 05:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
if they're not seating somebody at the
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
table absolutely i'm happy to get that
 
05:28:59.110 --> 05:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
for you thank you you're welcome
 
05:29:01.270 --> 05:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
i have a very short probably a very
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
simple question i can't respond to how
 
05:29:04.000 --> 05:29:05.190 align:start position:0%
simple question i can't respond to how
do

05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
best of you know how are students
 
05:29:09.030 --> 05:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
identified are they appointed by the
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
school board or are they
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
elected by the student council within
 
05:29:16.230 --> 05:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
the high school how might that happen it
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
happens differently at each school board
 
05:29:20.548 --> 05:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
and each district some students are
 
05:29:22.548 --> 05:29:22.558 align:start position:0%
elected by the student body
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
some students are
 
05:29:26.390 --> 05:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
included as a school board rep as part
 
05:29:28.628 --> 05:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
of their national honor society
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
service hours that's one of the ways in
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
which they're meeting those things some
 
05:29:32.400 --> 05:29:33.510 align:start position:0%
which they're meeting those things some
are

05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:29:35.590 --> 05:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
appointed as part of a course competency
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
potentially to maybe one semester you
 
05:29:39.270 --> 05:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
would have students from
 
05:29:41.350 --> 05:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
ap u.s history or ap civics who are
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
potentially serving on the board for
 
05:29:45.750 --> 05:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
their time in that course it really does
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
depend on the district and i think that
 
05:29:49.750 --> 05:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
was one of the reasons that we wanted to
 
05:29:49.760 --> 05:29:51.110 align:start position:0%
was one of the reasons that we wanted to
support

05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:29:53.430 --> 05:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
not mandating necessarily how the person
 
05:29:55.270 --> 05:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
would be identified to be the school
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
board rep for the student body that we
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
would leave that up to local districts
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
and local schools to determine that
 
05:30:01.760 --> 05:30:02.868 align:start position:0%
and local schools to determine that
then

05:30:02.868 --> 05:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:30:05.590 --> 05:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
is it so then that there are some
 
05:30:07.590 --> 05:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
school boards that have
 
05:30:07.600 --> 05:30:08.948 align:start position:0%
school boards that have
rotating

05:30:08.948 --> 05:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
rotating
 
05:30:11.830 --> 05:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
students on maybe by the month or
 
05:30:13.350 --> 05:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
bi-monthly or
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes that's accurate and i believe that
 
05:30:16.628 --> 05:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
for some districts that have multiple
 
05:30:18.150 --> 05:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
high schools right now that is how they
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
do it in terms of rotating a person from
 
05:30:22.390 --> 05:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
each high school over time
 
05:30:24.548 --> 05:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
not necessarily each high school at
 
05:30:26.628 --> 05:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
every meeting but for example if there's
 
05:30:28.070 --> 05:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
four quarters and there's four high
 
05:30:29.910 --> 05:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
schools in a certain district you may
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
have each quarter one high school is
 
05:30:34.150 --> 05:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
assigned to assign a student rep member
 
05:30:36.310 --> 05:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
for that amount of time thank you very
 
05:30:37.750 --> 05:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
much are there further questions from
 
05:30:39.670 --> 05:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative cornell
 
05:30:41.430 --> 05:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
this is really just a statement i just
 
05:30:43.350 --> 05:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
want to say it really is a good idea and
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know if everybody knows that the
 
05:30:44.878 --> 05:30:45.910 align:start position:0%
i don't know if everybody knows that the
student

05:30:45.910 --> 05:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:30:47.430 --> 05:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
board member
 
05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
in manchester just wrote the new dress
 
05:30:51.830 --> 05:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
code policy for the entire school
 
05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
district and it was accepted and voted
 
05:30:55.190 --> 05:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
on by the school board and that was
 
05:30:58.548 --> 05:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
written by the student so
 
05:31:00.628 --> 05:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
they really do a good job
 
05:31:02.230 --> 05:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:31:06.948 --> 05:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
05:31:08.948 --> 05:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:31:10.628 --> 05:31:10.638 align:start position:0%
are there any uh
 
05:31:12.868 --> 05:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
other folks that would like to testify
 
05:31:15.190 --> 05:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
regarding student participation on on
 
05:31:17.350 --> 05:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
the school boards
 
05:31:19.110 --> 05:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
not and we don't have any further pink
 
05:31:20.948 --> 05:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
cards up here so
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:46.628 --> 05:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:46.638 --> 05:32:28.548 align:start position:0%
 
1679.

05:32:28.548 --> 05:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:31.110 --> 05:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
no so we do another committee like jim
 
05:32:33.910 --> 05:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
grenier did years ago and there were a
 
05:32:35.670 --> 05:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
few things he did which were very
 
05:32:35.680 --> 05:32:36.788 align:start position:0%
few things he did which were very
positive

05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
positive
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
but i came up with just one big battle
 
05:32:42.070 --> 05:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
because there's those that don't want
 
05:32:44.230 --> 05:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
them dissolved and there's those that
 
05:32:47.830 --> 05:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
want to get out oh absolutely um
 
05:32:47.840 --> 05:32:49.110 align:start position:0%
want to get out oh absolutely um
but

05:32:49.110 --> 05:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is this was part of their couple
 
05:33:09.830 --> 05:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:11.350 --> 05:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right i don't want to see
 
05:33:12.868 --> 05:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
the whole thing dissolved and gone
 
05:33:14.708 --> 05:33:14.718 align:start position:0%
because that's just going sort of the
 
05:33:17.350 --> 05:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
opposite way we want to go as far as
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
you know cut down some of our
 
05:33:22.230 --> 05:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
administrative costs or cut down this
 
05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
look at our structural organization of
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
the whole thing
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
so this would not be the bill that i
 
05:33:29.910 --> 05:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
would choose i don't go forward with no
 
05:33:29.920 --> 05:33:30.868 align:start position:0%
would choose i don't go forward with no
um

05:33:30.868 --> 05:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
no no we don't pick one of the others
 
05:33:34.310 --> 05:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know i've also been thinking is
 
05:33:36.868 --> 05:33:36.878 align:start position:0%
there a need for us to have i'd like to
 
05:33:39.430 --> 05:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
commit a whole discussion on this and
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
bring folks in and have a
 
05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
but you know here we are with a
 
05:33:46.310 --> 05:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
dissolution of popular school districts
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
and you hear so much about from delanger
 
05:33:49.510 --> 05:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
and a whole lot of people i want to get
 
05:33:51.190 --> 05:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
out in this
 
05:33:53.110 --> 05:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
look what's showing up nobody's showing
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
up for it
 
05:33:55.990 --> 05:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh is it that they don't know it's being
 
05:33:57.910 --> 05:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
held uh because there's a lot of stuff
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
going on in education and you know
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:34:00.958 --> 05:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
you know
so

05:34:01.830 --> 05:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:01.840 --> 05:34:02.708 align:start position:0%
so
but

05:34:02.708 --> 05:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
if this is all we have is this the
 
05:34:06.788 --> 05:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
interest level that's that's my concern
 
05:34:06.798 --> 05:34:07.670 align:start position:0%
interest level that's that's my concern
here

05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:34:11.590 --> 05:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:11.600 --> 05:34:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:12.480 --> 05:34:13.350 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

05:34:13.350 --> 05:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:34:13.360 --> 05:34:14.788 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

05:34:14.788 --> 05:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
the only other way of doing it is really
 
05:34:20.070 --> 05:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
setting up a committee of the whole or a
 
05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but when do we do that yeah
 
05:34:23.430 --> 05:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
right we're not going to have time to do
 
05:34:25.190 --> 05:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
that is this a really built that's not
 
05:34:26.788 --> 05:34:26.798 align:start position:0%
an early bill
 
05:34:26.798 --> 05:34:27.990 align:start position:0%
an early bill
um

05:34:27.990 --> 05:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:29.430 --> 05:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of financial
 
05:34:29.440 --> 05:34:31.830 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of financial
ramifications

05:34:31.830 --> 05:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
05:34:35.990 --> 05:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
yeah let's see
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's not is it no i didn't think it was
 
05:34:41.520 --> 05:34:43.670 align:start position:0%
it's not is it no i didn't think it was
so

05:34:43.670 --> 05:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:45.990 --> 05:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
so we have through march
 
05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:01.830 --> 05:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:04.390 --> 05:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
those were co-op apportionments
 
05:35:04.400 --> 05:35:06.708 align:start position:0%
those were co-op apportionments
to

05:35:06.708 --> 05:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:21.200 --> 05:35:46.948 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:35:46.948 --> 05:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
this whole thing is like there are
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
pockets of problems yeah that's right
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
but it's not a gl it's not a universal
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
well i'm in a cooperative school
 
05:35:54.878 --> 05:35:56.150 align:start position:0%
well i'm in a cooperative school
district

05:35:56.150 --> 05:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:35:57.510 --> 05:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
and haven't was getting pretty tired
 
05:35:59.270 --> 05:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
paying the bill
 
05:36:00.628 --> 05:36:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
05:36:02.548 --> 05:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
there's interest up there but it's not
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
at the level where they're saying we
 
05:36:05.670 --> 05:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
want to get out
 
05:36:07.750 --> 05:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
they realize the dynamics it's just like
 
05:36:13.350 --> 05:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
and if i look around on the committee
 
05:36:15.440 --> 05:36:16.548 align:start position:0%
and if i look around on the committee
here

05:36:16.548 --> 05:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
who who would have an interest in that
 
05:36:21.510 --> 05:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
on this committee besides
 
05:36:21.520 --> 05:36:22.310 align:start position:0%
on this committee besides
okay

05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:36:23.670 --> 05:36:23.680 align:start position:0%

05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
finance bill you got going
 
05:36:39.990 --> 05:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
so i i guess we can chew and walk
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:49.350 --> 05:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
the question i say is
 
05:36:51.990 --> 05:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
trying to is this the year
 
05:36:56.830 --> 05:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:56.840 --> 05:36:58.548 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:36:58.548 --> 05:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:37:00.868 --> 05:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
i know it i know it
 
05:37:00.878 --> 05:40:27.830 align:start position:0%
i know it i know it
politically

05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:27.840 --> 05:48:42.708 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:46.150 --> 05:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
when i lived in maine i was just hoping
 
05:48:51.430 --> 05:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
they cut the bridge down in kittery
 
05:48:51.440 --> 05:48:53.430 align:start position:0%
they cut the bridge down in kittery
okay

05:48:53.430 --> 05:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:48:56.548 --> 05:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
and that's what chased me to alaska
 
05:48:59.190 --> 05:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh here we are now it's time to go
 
05:49:01.030 --> 05:49:01.040 align:start position:0%

repeal of cooperative school districts
 
05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is not here
 
05:49:10.948 --> 05:49:10.958 align:start position:0%

05:49:14.948 --> 05:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
boom
 
05:49:18.948 --> 05:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
05:49:22.948 --> 05:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
thank you education committee
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
bill relative to the dissolution and
 
05:49:26.310 --> 05:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
repeal of cooperative school districts
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
there are a number of people here going
 
05:49:31.110 --> 05:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
to speak but just so the many years that
 
05:49:32.390 --> 05:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
i've been on
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
the education committee just about every
 
05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
year we've had builds on cooperative
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
school districts one of the problems we
 
05:49:40.470 --> 05:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
have in the state is every cooperative
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
school district is different
 
05:49:44.230 --> 05:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
so when schools want to leave it
 
05:49:46.150 --> 05:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
depending on what the
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
cooperative district is
 
05:49:50.708 --> 05:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
so that's always been an issue so this
 
05:49:53.270 --> 05:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill i know a lot of us disgusted over
 
05:49:54.788 --> 05:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
the summer on what to do about
 
05:49:57.030 --> 05:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts and one of
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
the things that when i want we just get
 
05:50:01.190 --> 05:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
rid of them so one of the things that
 
05:50:03.670 --> 05:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
this is for discussion and we'll have
 
05:50:06.150 --> 05:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
more debate on it and what not on what
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
we can do about it so with that
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:12.070 --> 05:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative boom
 
05:50:13.190 --> 05:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
05:50:14.948 --> 05:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
representative boom it's your
 
05:50:14.958 --> 05:50:16.390 align:start position:0%
representative boom it's your
opportunity

05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:50:19.030 --> 05:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
reps and lakers
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you know the answer to
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
this but thank you for taking my
 
05:50:24.150 --> 05:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
question anyway
 
05:50:24.160 --> 05:50:25.270 align:start position:0%
question anyway
um

05:50:25.270 --> 05:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
what if a cooperative school district
 
05:50:29.430 --> 05:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to disband
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
well that's one of the problems we have
 
05:50:34.708 --> 05:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of them want to or dissolution to
 
05:50:37.350 --> 05:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
dissolve or whatnot or remove themselves
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
from the cooperative school district and
 
05:50:40.390 --> 05:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's one of the problems we've had
 
05:50:42.070 --> 05:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
like i said nearly every year i've been
 
05:50:45.190 --> 05:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
here since 2008
 
05:50:47.110 --> 05:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
and but the problem is it's always been
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
05:50:48.240 --> 05:50:49.190 align:start position:0%
a problem
and

05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:50:51.750 --> 05:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
and what to do about it so that's
 
05:50:54.070 --> 05:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
why you know glenn put this bill in
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative put this bill in but the
 
05:50:58.230 --> 05:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
stuff we have discussed on what to do
 
05:50:59.750 --> 05:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
and this i think just opens up
 
05:51:02.310 --> 05:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
discussion on what we can do
 
05:51:05.590 --> 05:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
well i've i since we got a question yeah
 
05:51:08.310 --> 05:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
i tried to but you weren't looking yes
 
05:51:09.430 --> 05:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:14.788 --> 05:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
since this has come in other
 
05:51:19.590 --> 05:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts that are very
 
05:51:19.600 --> 05:51:20.708 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts that are very
happy

05:51:20.708 --> 05:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
happy
 
05:51:23.430 --> 05:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
have asked do they still have to
 
05:51:26.230 --> 05:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
dissolve when they're very happy or can
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
this be
 
05:51:30.390 --> 05:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
somehow amended so that
 
05:51:32.470 --> 05:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have to i don't know that's
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
why we sort of hope the discussion and i
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
know there's one cooperative school
 
05:51:37.510 --> 05:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
district which isn't a cooperative
 
05:51:39.670 --> 05:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
school district the town of derry is a
 
05:51:41.750 --> 05:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district with east
 
05:51:43.590 --> 05:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
derry which is no longer exists because
 
05:51:45.190 --> 05:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
they became found of derry but they're
 
05:51:48.868 --> 05:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:51.190 --> 05:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
05:51:54.390 --> 05:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh next uh
 
05:51:56.230 --> 05:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
speaker will be representative tony
 
05:51:56.240 --> 05:52:02.948 align:start position:0%
speaker will be representative tony
pamonti

05:52:02.948 --> 05:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee for taking my testimony here
 
05:52:11.110 --> 05:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
um i will say that i am not the
 
05:52:12.868 --> 05:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
mr cordelli representative cordelie is
 
05:52:14.948 --> 05:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
the main sponsor on this bill
 
05:52:16.628 --> 05:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
and i didn't realize he was here today
 
05:52:18.788 --> 05:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to make a few statements or
 
05:52:20.310 --> 05:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
words for him
 
05:52:22.948 --> 05:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
um on this uh
 
05:52:25.990 --> 05:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
on this uh house bill 1679
 
05:52:27.670 --> 05:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
um there
 
05:52:29.590 --> 05:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
is a way to negotiate
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:52:34.230 --> 05:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
amount of money that a student would pay
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
and that could be done within the towns
 
05:52:38.470 --> 05:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
whether they have two representatives
 
05:52:40.070 --> 05:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
that would negotiate with the school
 
05:52:40.080 --> 05:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
that would negotiate with the school
board

05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:52:43.670 --> 05:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
and they would be able to
 
05:52:45.670 --> 05:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
go to the same schools
 
05:52:45.680 --> 05:52:46.868 align:start position:0%
go to the same schools
but

05:52:46.868 --> 05:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:52:49.190 --> 05:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
maybe at a cost it would be
 
05:52:51.270 --> 05:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit less and more desirable to
 
05:52:51.280 --> 05:52:52.150 align:start position:0%
a little bit less and more desirable to
them

05:52:52.150 --> 05:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh i know this there's a lot of uh
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
discussion now about how certain school
 
05:52:59.590 --> 05:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
boards are acting
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
and and this may solve that problem you
 
05:53:04.390 --> 05:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
know we just have to see i think the
 
05:53:05.590 --> 05:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
rest of the
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
risk the information would come out
 
05:53:10.390 --> 05:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
during the your executive session
 
05:53:13.030 --> 05:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
but uh it could have something to reduce
 
05:53:14.150 --> 05:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
in taxes
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
it could reduce your budgets
 
05:53:18.310 --> 05:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
there's a number of things that could
 
05:53:20.230 --> 05:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
play into effect and i i don't know how
 
05:53:21.350 --> 05:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
those will
 
05:53:25.350 --> 05:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh come out as as we sit right here now
 
05:53:27.110 --> 05:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
05:53:32.230 --> 05:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative yes represent woodcock
 
05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i thank you for another
 
05:53:35.190 --> 05:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
question can you tell me how many
 
05:53:36.390 --> 05:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts there are
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the state um i do not know
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
and this is this just strictly
 
05:53:42.150 --> 05:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
cooperative or regional schools involved
 
05:53:43.830 --> 05:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
in this as well
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh again i believe it's just the
 
05:53:48.150 --> 05:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts but
 
05:53:48.160 --> 05:53:49.190 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts but
um

05:53:49.190 --> 05:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:51.750 --> 05:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not fully uh thank you voiced on
 
05:53:53.590 --> 05:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you further yes
 
05:53:55.190 --> 05:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative lakas
 
05:53:57.830 --> 05:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
can i ask you the same question
 
05:54:01.590 --> 05:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to amending this
 
05:54:04.150 --> 05:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
to allow a school district where all the
 
05:54:06.548 --> 05:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
towns involved voted to
 
05:54:08.868 --> 05:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
stay in the cooperative school district
 
05:54:10.788 --> 05:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
to get to state a cooperative school
 
05:54:10.798 --> 05:54:11.990 align:start position:0%
to get to state a cooperative school
district

05:54:11.990 --> 05:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:54:14.150 --> 05:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this bill is now in your
 
05:54:16.868 --> 05:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
committee and it has not much to do with
 
05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
me so any amendments that you make
 
05:54:23.110 --> 05:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted your opinion
 
05:54:27.270 --> 05:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
05:54:29.190 --> 05:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative moffat uh a clerk
 
05:54:31.110 --> 05:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
question for you representative did you
 
05:54:33.510 --> 05:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
say fortunately or unfortunately is with
 
05:54:37.110 --> 05:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
this this committee
 
05:54:38.230 --> 05:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
it is with
 
05:54:40.230 --> 05:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't know whether uh whether i did
 
05:54:42.708 --> 05:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
say fortunately but it is with your your
 
05:54:42.718 --> 05:54:44.230 align:start position:0%
say fortunately but it is with your your
uh

05:54:44.230 --> 05:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:54:46.150 --> 05:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
your purview now
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.830 --> 05:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%

good afternoon again
 
05:55:09.430 --> 05:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
chairman lad and members of the

association
 
05:55:18.310 --> 05:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
um we're here today in opposition of
 
05:55:20.548 --> 05:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
this bill however we would like to make
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
some recommendations as opposed to just
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
stating why this bill
 
05:55:27.750 --> 05:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
is difficult for us to move forward with
 
05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to trying to solve the
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
numerous individual issues that have
 
05:55:34.150 --> 05:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
come to this board to this committee
 
05:55:36.150 --> 05:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
regarding co-op districts in the
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
multiple bills we would really like to
 
05:55:39.510 --> 05:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
consider whether or not this committee
 
05:55:41.030 --> 05:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
could move forward with developing a
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
study commission to look at each of
 
05:55:44.070 --> 05:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
these items
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
in its entirety
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
together and the impact of each one and
 
05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
how they interplay
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
with the cooperative districts to answer
 
05:55:52.628 --> 05:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
a question that was just asked there are
 
05:55:55.590 --> 05:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
42 or around 42 regional or cooperative
 
05:55:57.510 --> 05:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state
 
05:55:59.350 --> 05:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's a high number of districts that
 
05:56:01.030 --> 05:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
this these kinds of bills around
 
05:56:02.548 --> 05:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts would certainly
 
05:56:04.628 --> 05:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
affect that
 
05:56:07.350 --> 05:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
we did speak with chairman ladd earlier
 
05:56:09.110 --> 05:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
in this session in response to some of
 
05:56:10.628 --> 05:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
the other cooperative bills that have
 
05:56:11.910 --> 05:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
come forward
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
and we did
 
05:56:14.868 --> 05:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
bring with us today in our testimony
 
05:56:16.948 --> 05:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
some potential language that could be
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
used to develop that study commission
 
05:56:20.470 --> 05:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
05:56:22.390 --> 05:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
with all of the complexities involved
 
05:56:24.390 --> 05:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
with regional and cooperative districts
 
05:56:26.470 --> 05:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
to try to look at each individual item
 
05:56:29.110 --> 05:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
without considering the impact of
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
each one on the other and the domino
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
effects that happen when certain bills
 
05:56:34.548 --> 05:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
are put through for one aspect of
 
05:56:36.310 --> 05:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
cooperatives and not looking at the
 
05:56:38.470 --> 05:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
entire system as a whole we really feel
 
05:56:40.150 --> 05:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
like that that would be
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
detrimental to districts across new
 
05:56:42.558 --> 05:56:43.670 align:start position:0%
detrimental to districts across new
hampshire

05:56:43.670 --> 05:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:56:45.670 --> 05:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to try to take any questions i
 
05:56:47.270 --> 05:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
will say that barrett was planning to be
 
05:56:49.590 --> 05:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
here today to testify but he's been
 
05:56:51.590 --> 05:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
pulled away unexpectedly and as he
 
05:56:53.670 --> 05:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
stated last week our areas of expertise
 
05:56:53.680 --> 05:56:54.628 align:start position:0%
stated last week our areas of expertise
are

05:56:54.628 --> 05:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:56:54.638 --> 05:56:55.510 align:start position:0%
are
very

05:56:55.510 --> 05:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:56:57.030 --> 05:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
combined but together we have very
 
05:56:59.110 --> 05:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
different areas of expertise so if there
 
05:57:00.628 --> 05:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
are questions that i can answer today
 
05:57:02.070 --> 05:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer them and if not i'm
 
05:57:03.910 --> 05:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
happy to get the answer for you thank
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions of
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:11.590 --> 05:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thanks
 
05:57:14.230 --> 05:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
very much mr wilson for uh for sticking
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
with us this afternoon uh you mentioned
 
05:57:18.470 --> 05:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
that there are 42 cooperatives is that
 
05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
42 municipalities that are in
 
05:57:22.628 --> 05:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
cooperatives or is that 42 cooperatives
 
05:57:24.390 --> 05:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
i believe just 42 cooperative or
 
05:57:26.390 --> 05:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
regional school districts and and so
 
05:57:28.830 --> 05:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up on that and so that would
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:33.510 --> 05:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
a lot more
 
05:57:35.910 --> 05:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
maybe double that or three times that in
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
terms of municipalities yes it would
 
05:57:39.350 --> 05:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
certainly be a much higher number than
 
05:57:41.830 --> 05:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
just 42. okay thanks and then a final
 
05:57:44.948 --> 05:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
question on related to this are there
 
05:57:48.788 --> 05:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
any municipalities that are members of
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh maybe at the same time a non you know
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
a single school district as well as a
 
05:57:55.110 --> 05:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district
 
05:57:56.470 --> 05:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
like concord
 
05:57:59.030 --> 05:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes certainly
 
05:57:59.040 --> 05:58:00.708 align:start position:0%
yes certainly
yes

05:58:00.708 --> 05:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:58:02.868 --> 05:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
yes certainly there are municipalities
 
05:58:04.868 --> 05:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
that obviously run their own district
 
05:58:06.230 --> 05:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
school and then are also part of a
 
05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
larger cooperative or regional district
 
05:58:09.750 --> 05:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
especially at the higher grade levels so
 
05:58:12.390 --> 05:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
it gets complicated fast cooperatives
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:18.948 --> 05:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:58:21.750 --> 05:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh becky i have uh has the school boards
 
05:58:25.270 --> 05:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
association we've looked at this issue
 
05:58:26.948 --> 05:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
every year i've been in the house so
 
05:58:29.270 --> 05:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's 14 years that i know of
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
um and we know that there are if you
 
05:58:34.230 --> 05:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
take all the municipalities or towns
 
05:58:36.310 --> 05:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
that are part of these co-ops
 
05:58:38.470 --> 05:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
according to the fiscal note in the back
 
05:58:40.948 --> 05:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
side we're talking at least 117
 
05:58:40.958 --> 05:58:42.628 align:start position:0%
side we're talking at least 117
communities

05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:58:44.788 --> 05:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
and but there is a
 
05:58:46.470 --> 05:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
note in the
 
05:58:48.070 --> 05:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note here
 
05:58:53.110 --> 05:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
that by doing so we create 90 new school
 
05:58:54.788 --> 05:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
districts throughout the state my
 
05:58:56.470 --> 05:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
question then is
 
05:58:59.590 --> 05:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
has your association looked at what
 
05:59:01.590 --> 05:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
what additional costs it's going to take
 
05:59:04.150 --> 05:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
an administration and
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
costs associated with forming a new
 
05:59:07.110 --> 05:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
district would be
 
05:59:08.868 --> 05:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
no but thank you for the question uh
 
05:59:10.948 --> 05:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
representative we have not looked um at
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
that granular level in terms of what the
 
05:59:15.750 --> 05:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
actual cost would be to try to
 
05:59:18.070 --> 05:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
move in this direction i think it's you
 
05:59:20.708 --> 05:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
know it's certainly a resource issue not
 
05:59:23.430 --> 05:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
only fiscally but just in terms of
 
05:59:25.510 --> 05:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
getting staffing and superintendents and
 
05:59:26.708 --> 05:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things that would need to
 
05:59:29.830 --> 05:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
be put into effect if this were to go
 
05:59:32.230 --> 05:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
forward it just the resources in all
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
areas i think would be certainly tapped
 
05:59:37.030 --> 05:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
out to a very high extent
 
05:59:39.750 --> 05:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
05:59:43.350 --> 05:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
yes represent woodcock thank you uh
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again thank you um
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i'm clear on
 
05:59:49.670 --> 05:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
the understanding
 
05:59:51.030 --> 05:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
my interpretation or what i think the
 
05:59:52.470 --> 05:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
05:59:55.110 --> 05:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
a cooperative school and i know they've
 
05:59:56.708 --> 05:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
talked about francis down the small but
 
05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:01.830 --> 06:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of the disillusion as presented
 
06:00:03.110 --> 06:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
06:00:04.708 --> 06:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
is the same for example kingswood
 
06:00:06.708 --> 06:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
regional high school
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
so all the regional schools
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
are considered the same as cooperative
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
schools is that correct thank you for
 
06:00:13.430 --> 06:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
the question yes that would be our
 
06:00:13.440 --> 06:00:14.708 align:start position:0%
the question yes that would be our
interpretation

06:00:14.708 --> 06:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
06:00:15.910 --> 06:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you ruffled
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
interled you're welcome
 
06:00:19.590 --> 06:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:00:21.110 --> 06:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands thank you very much
 
06:00:23.270 --> 06:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:00:28.390 --> 06:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:32.230 --> 06:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:48.868 --> 06:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:48.878 --> 06:00:52.788 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:55.110 --> 06:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
huh is this on now good
 
06:00:56.788 --> 06:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman laden members of
 
06:01:00.708 --> 06:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:02.470 --> 06:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
happy that you have given me this time
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
to address you and share my members
 
06:01:09.670 --> 06:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:10.948 --> 06:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
and i have
 
06:01:12.830 --> 06:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony that i'll give you
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
after we're here to oppose hb 1679
 
06:01:19.110 --> 06:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
this bill mandates the breakup of
 
06:01:21.030 --> 06:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts and from
 
06:01:22.788 --> 06:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
our perspective it would hurt kids and
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
families by arbitrarily disrupting
 
06:01:26.868 --> 06:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
children's education
 
06:01:28.310 --> 06:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
it wastes time and money that should be
 
06:01:29.670 --> 06:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
going to our students and they have so
 
06:01:31.350 --> 06:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
many needs right now we really can't
 
06:01:33.190 --> 06:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
afford to be
 
06:01:34.868 --> 06:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
spending it setting up 90 new school
 
06:01:36.868 --> 06:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
districts it would interfere in towns
 
06:01:39.190 --> 06:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
and parents educational decisions
 
06:01:41.190 --> 06:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
and also decisions that voters have made
 
06:01:42.948 --> 06:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
over the past decades
 
06:01:45.350 --> 06:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
they've likely raised property taxes
 
06:01:48.948 --> 06:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
it would set up a backdoor pressure to
 
06:01:51.030 --> 06:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
take up vouchers and and send kids to
 
06:01:53.190 --> 06:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
charter schools to create unnecessary
 
06:01:55.510 --> 06:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
state bureaucracy as there would be much
 
06:01:57.270 --> 06:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
needed support to set up those 90 new
 
06:01:59.590 --> 06:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
for decades new hampshire towns that
 
06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
were too small to finance their own
 
06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
school systems have banded together in
 
06:02:06.788 --> 06:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts and as we
 
06:02:08.470 --> 06:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
just heard they're currently about 42
 
06:02:09.990 --> 06:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
cooperative and regional school
 
06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
districts mostly in rural areas of the
 
06:02:12.240 --> 06:02:13.110 align:start position:0%
districts mostly in rural areas of the
state

06:02:13.110 --> 06:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:02:15.030 --> 06:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
those districts provide real benefits to
 
06:02:16.708 --> 06:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
our students they're a great way for
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
smaller towns to share school buildings
 
06:02:20.548 --> 06:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
teachers staff offering cost and capital
 
06:02:22.470 --> 06:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
expenses and avoid duplicating
 
06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
administrative systems they give
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
students in smaller towns access to
 
06:02:28.708 --> 06:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
academics sports art music and other
 
06:02:30.868 --> 06:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
services and programs that single towns
 
06:02:33.270 --> 06:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
alone can't afford
 
06:02:34.708 --> 06:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
and they're flexible
 
06:02:36.548 --> 06:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
for example some towns just share a high
 
06:02:37.910 --> 06:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
school and have their own elementary and
 
06:02:39.910 --> 06:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
middle schools so
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
the individual towns and districts
 
06:02:44.230 --> 06:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
decide what they want and the voters
 
06:02:45.510 --> 06:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
have a say
 
06:02:47.830 --> 06:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
mandating that those all be dissolved is
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
going against local troll going against
 
06:02:51.750 --> 06:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
what the voters over time have decided
 
06:02:51.760 --> 06:02:54.788 align:start position:0%
what the voters over time have decided
decided

06:02:54.788 --> 06:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:56.070 --> 06:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
students and families could find
 
06:02:57.910 --> 06:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
themselves suddenly without the teachers
 
06:03:00.070 --> 06:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
staff school and programs and services
 
06:03:01.830 --> 06:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
they've always had the bill would
 
06:03:04.390 --> 06:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily disrupt education for
 
06:03:08.150 --> 06:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of kids across our state
 
06:03:09.910 --> 06:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
the bill gives towns who are now part of
 
06:03:12.548 --> 06:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts two costly and
 
06:03:14.548 --> 06:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
equally bad choices
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
they either have to suddenly create
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
their own district and this bill has a
 
06:03:20.948 --> 06:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
deadline of 2025 that's hardly any time
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
to plan
 
06:03:25.510 --> 06:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh or pay whatever it costs to
 
06:03:27.430 --> 06:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
send their students
 
06:03:29.030 --> 06:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
06:03:31.830 --> 06:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
another town under a tuition agreement
 
06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
or perhaps to another
 
06:03:35.350 --> 06:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:03:37.350 --> 06:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
non-public school in an area
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
or maybe it's going to force more
 
06:03:41.190 --> 06:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
families to take up the
 
06:03:42.948 --> 06:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
efa program
 
06:03:45.590 --> 06:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
which we all know is well over budget
 
06:03:45.600 --> 06:03:46.628 align:start position:0%
which we all know is well over budget
and

06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions about how
 
06:03:50.070 --> 06:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's running
 
06:03:51.590 --> 06:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard the argument that there's a
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
lot of problems in cooperative districts
 
06:03:55.270 --> 06:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
but there already is a solution for
 
06:03:56.230 --> 06:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
towns that want to get out of
 
06:03:58.230 --> 06:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts it exists in
 
06:04:00.230 --> 06:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
current law
 
06:04:00.240 --> 06:04:01.350 align:start position:0%
current law
this

06:04:01.350 --> 06:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
proposed solution is like grabbing a
 
06:04:06.390 --> 06:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
sledgehammer when a scaffold will do
 
06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
polling shows polling that we did back
 
06:04:10.788 --> 06:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
in december with heart research shows
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
that granite state voters
 
06:04:15.510 --> 06:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
support their local public schools
 
06:04:15.520 --> 06:04:16.390 align:start position:0%
support their local public schools
74

06:04:16.390 --> 06:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
74
 
06:04:18.230 --> 06:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
of them want stronger investment in
 
06:04:19.830 --> 06:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
their public schools
 
06:04:21.910 --> 06:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
72 percent of them
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
want to see their public schools
 
06:04:25.590 --> 06:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
supported they don't want to see
 
06:04:27.670 --> 06:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
vouchers they don't want to see more
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
charter schools they want to see their
 
06:04:30.948 --> 06:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
public schools supported
 
06:04:33.750 --> 06:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
our children right now need stability
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
social and emotional supports and a safe
 
06:04:37.590 --> 06:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
and welcoming environment
 
06:04:39.270 --> 06:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
in every school so we can help them not
 
06:04:40.788 --> 06:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
only recover from disruptions of the
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
past two years
 
06:04:44.548 --> 06:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
they don't need to have their schooling
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
and their social networks thrown into
 
06:04:46.080 --> 06:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
and their social networks thrown into
chaos

06:04:47.510 --> 06:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
chaos
 
06:04:49.190 --> 06:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion
 
06:04:49.200 --> 06:04:50.230 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion
please

06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
please
 
06:04:50.240 --> 06:04:51.230 align:start position:0%
please
stop

06:04:51.230 --> 06:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
stop
 
06:04:55.110 --> 06:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
hb1679 let's keep our school districts
 
06:04:57.030 --> 06:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
going forward let's focus on what the
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
kids need and
 
06:04:59.520 --> 06:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
kids need and
not

06:05:00.390 --> 06:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:05:01.830 --> 06:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
take a sledgehammer to something that
 
06:05:03.190 --> 06:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
needs a scalpel
 
06:05:04.390 --> 06:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:06.310 --> 06:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
06:05:09.750 --> 06:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:18.470 --> 06:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:21.030 --> 06:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other individuals in the
 
06:05:23.110 --> 06:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh chairs out front that would like to
 
06:05:25.590 --> 06:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
testify in this that may not have put a
 
06:05:28.470 --> 06:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:30.470 --> 06:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
so it looks like we have the pink cards
 
06:05:31.910 --> 06:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
which we have that we've gone through
 
06:05:33.510 --> 06:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
though so with that i'm going to close
 
06:05:54.548 --> 06:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:56.390 --> 06:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
06:06:02.390 --> 06:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:11.030 --> 06:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:13.350 --> 06:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
theresa wyman canterbury new hampshire
 
06:06:15.750 --> 06:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you
 
06:06:22.788 --> 06:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:25.910 --> 06:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
i am here as a private citizen am i too
 
06:06:25.920 --> 06:06:27.030 align:start position:0%
i am here as a private citizen am i too
loud

06:06:27.030 --> 06:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
loud
 
06:06:30.788 --> 06:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
i can talk wicked loud if you want me to
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
but i know that i have friends and that
 
06:06:35.510 --> 06:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
there are many others who share my
 
06:06:39.030 --> 06:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
opinion and perhaps can't be here
 
06:06:43.030 --> 06:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
i am appalled by this bill
 
06:06:46.788 --> 06:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
this country was founded by my ancestors
 
06:06:50.788 --> 06:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
with a strong value on public education
 
06:06:52.868 --> 06:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
that means everybody goes to school that
 
06:06:54.390 --> 06:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean charter schools and
 
06:06:56.628 --> 06:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
vouchers that means a public school that
 
06:06:58.868 --> 06:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
every child can go to
 
06:07:04.390 --> 06:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
although i myself am a retired rn i come
 
06:07:10.310 --> 06:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
from a family of teachers so i think i
 
06:07:12.310 --> 06:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
have some credibility in this my mom
 
06:07:14.628 --> 06:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
taught kindergarten for many years
 
06:07:16.150 --> 06:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
including managing a private
 
06:07:17.830 --> 06:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
kindergarten town that didn't have a
 
06:07:20.150 --> 06:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
public one
 
06:07:22.708 --> 06:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
my dad's teaching career started
 
06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
by teaching sixth grade in
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
the tilton northfield district uh
 
06:07:28.390 --> 06:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
technically the building is in
 
06:07:28.400 --> 06:07:29.990 align:start position:0%
technically the building is in
northfield

06:07:29.990 --> 06:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
northfield
 
06:07:32.310 --> 06:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
and it ended with him being a highly
 
06:07:33.990 --> 06:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
respected member of the faculty of the
 
06:07:36.708 --> 06:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
university of massachusetts
 
06:07:40.390 --> 06:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a product of public education
 
06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
i started school in canterbury new
 
06:07:44.788 --> 06:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i
 
06:07:46.708 --> 06:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
my finished my
 
06:07:49.430 --> 06:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
bachelor of science at umass i would
 
06:07:52.948 --> 06:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
have preferred to have gone to unh
 
06:07:52.958 --> 06:07:55.110 align:start position:0%
have preferred to have gone to unh
but

06:07:55.110 --> 06:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:07:57.510 --> 06:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
umass was a whole lot thriftier choice
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition there was quite
 
06:07:59.280 --> 06:08:00.948 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition there was quite
affordable

06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
06:08:03.350 --> 06:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
and unless anybody have any question
 
06:08:05.430 --> 06:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
about it i did not get a cup because my
 
06:08:07.830 --> 06:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
dad was on the faculty
 
06:08:09.830 --> 06:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
i had a key to his office if i wanted to
 
06:08:11.430 --> 06:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
study there but it was the other end of
 
06:08:15.910 --> 06:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:18.150 --> 06:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
so that's my background my reasons for
 
06:08:20.548 --> 06:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill there are three basic
 
06:08:24.230 --> 06:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
reasons one has to do with education
 
06:08:26.390 --> 06:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
to those who have started this bill and
 
06:08:29.430 --> 06:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whom i should be looking at
 
06:08:31.270 --> 06:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
please tell me how it would be
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
advantageous for high school students to
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
attend a smaller school with fewer
 
06:08:35.760 --> 06:08:37.110 align:start position:0%
attend a smaller school with fewer
choices

06:08:37.110 --> 06:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
choices
 
06:08:38.788 --> 06:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't make sense to me for
 
06:08:40.470 --> 06:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
example would there be one teacher for
 
06:08:42.628 --> 06:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
all the sciences instead of perhaps one
 
06:08:44.788 --> 06:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
in biology one in chemistry one in
 
06:08:44.798 --> 06:08:46.708 align:start position:0%
in biology one in chemistry one in
physics

06:08:46.708 --> 06:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
physics
 
06:08:49.590 --> 06:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
planning curriculum takes time
 
06:08:51.590 --> 06:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
planning in several subjects takes more
 
06:08:53.590 --> 06:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
time than planning different levels of
 
06:08:54.830 --> 06:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
the same
 
06:08:54.840 --> 06:08:56.788 align:start position:0%
the same
subject

06:08:56.788 --> 06:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
subject
 
06:08:58.948 --> 06:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that teachers put
 
06:09:01.270 --> 06:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
plenty of time into their planning by
 
06:09:03.190 --> 06:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
the time i was 12 i said there's no way
 
06:09:05.110 --> 06:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be a teacher
 
06:09:07.030 --> 06:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
it was too much work i'm not sure being
 
06:09:08.788 --> 06:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
a nurse was a whole lot less but i
 
06:09:11.750 --> 06:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
didn't know that at the time
 
06:09:14.070 --> 06:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
and what i say about planning curriculum
 
06:09:16.310 --> 06:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
etc that applies to all fields whether
 
06:09:19.350 --> 06:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's english foreign languages
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
how many languages are you going to have
 
06:09:22.470 --> 06:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
in a school that
 
06:09:24.230 --> 06:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enough teachers to have
 
06:09:26.788 --> 06:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
more than one
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
and what about things like computers
 
06:09:29.040 --> 06:09:30.310 align:start position:0%
and what about things like computers
that

06:09:30.310 --> 06:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:09:32.150 --> 06:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to that i can barely make
 
06:09:34.868 --> 06:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:36.788 --> 06:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
and how about
 
06:09:39.190 --> 06:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
the many things that are not part of the
 
06:09:41.030 --> 06:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
formal curriculum
 
06:09:43.750 --> 06:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
sports a lot of people like that it's
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's life-saving to many kids theater
 
06:09:47.120 --> 06:09:48.150 align:start position:0%
it's life-saving to many kids theater
music

06:09:48.150 --> 06:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
music
 
06:09:50.230 --> 06:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
dance band
 
06:09:54.628 --> 06:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:57.190 --> 06:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
education involves exposure to new
 
06:09:57.200 --> 06:09:58.470 align:start position:0%
education involves exposure to new
things

06:09:58.470 --> 06:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:10:00.788 --> 06:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
a regional school may provide students
 
06:10:02.868 --> 06:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
with an opportunity to know people from
 
06:10:05.270 --> 06:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
different demographics
 
06:10:06.788 --> 06:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
the world which they will enter as
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
adults will be filled with people from
 
06:10:11.110 --> 06:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
all kinds of backgrounds
 
06:10:13.590 --> 06:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
let our kids begin to experience this
 
06:10:13.600 --> 06:10:15.270 align:start position:0%
let our kids begin to experience this
please

06:10:15.270 --> 06:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
please
 
06:10:18.628 --> 06:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
less is more i don't think so
 
06:10:21.750 --> 06:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's education financial
 
06:10:23.430 --> 06:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
if towns in a given district for
 
06:10:25.510 --> 06:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason find that their regional
 
06:10:27.190 --> 06:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
school district is not working they
 
06:10:29.270 --> 06:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
already have the option of reconsidering
 
06:10:30.948 --> 06:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
this alliance
 
06:10:32.548 --> 06:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
there are some people in canterbury
 
06:10:34.628 --> 06:10:34.638 align:start position:0%
right now who are considering a study
 
06:10:36.230 --> 06:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
and i believe at this point it's just a
 
06:10:36.240 --> 06:10:37.110 align:start position:0%
and i believe at this point it's just a
study

06:10:37.110 --> 06:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
study
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
of whether being in a regional school
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:46.708 --> 06:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
this includes the option of building our
 
06:10:48.948 --> 06:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
own high school though this bill is
 
06:10:51.190 --> 06:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
superfluous why are you wasting your
 
06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:55.750 --> 06:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
if regional schools were to be
 
06:10:57.910 --> 06:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
dismantled there would undoubtedly be a
 
06:11:00.390 --> 06:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
large increase in property taxes in many
 
06:11:00.400 --> 06:11:02.150 align:start position:0%
large increase in property taxes in many
towns

06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
towns
 
06:11:04.390 --> 06:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
those of us from a thrifty yankee
 
06:11:06.628 --> 06:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
background object to paying more unless
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
we get more
 
06:11:10.470 --> 06:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
in this case as i noted previously we
 
06:11:12.868 --> 06:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
would be getting less
 
06:11:14.868 --> 06:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many times i've told
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
people the education of our kids in town
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
is important to everyone i don't mind
 
06:11:22.948 --> 06:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
paying taxes for that but i sure as hell
 
06:11:24.788 --> 06:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
mind paying more taxes for less
 
06:11:24.798 --> 06:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
mind paying more taxes for less
education

06:11:27.750 --> 06:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:29.670 --> 06:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
and if you think i'm emotional now will
 
06:11:33.750 --> 06:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
you get to philosophy of local control
 
06:11:36.070 --> 06:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
what about local control i believe that
 
06:11:37.830 --> 06:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
many of the people sponsoring this bill
 
06:11:40.868 --> 06:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
are generally in favor of more not less
 
06:11:42.868 --> 06:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
local control
 
06:11:45.910 --> 06:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
so why do you feel the school should be
 
06:11:49.430 --> 06:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
regulated by the state government
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
and i might point out that the state of
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doesn't do much to fund
 
06:11:55.510 --> 06:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
education anyhow there's plenty of
 
06:11:57.750 --> 06:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
evidence going back to claremont about
 
06:11:59.190 --> 06:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
that and i'm old enough to remember a
 
06:12:02.548 --> 06:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
lot of that in the newspapers
 
06:12:04.868 --> 06:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
as it is largely the town property taxes
 
06:12:06.788 --> 06:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
that pay for education it seems it would
 
06:12:09.670 --> 06:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
be only fair for the townspeople not the
 
06:12:11.990 --> 06:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislators from concord who represent
 
06:12:14.070 --> 06:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
only a small number of school districts
 
06:12:15.190 --> 06:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
06:12:16.548 --> 06:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
would be the ones deciding how our
 
06:12:19.510 --> 06:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
children are educated
 
06:12:21.750 --> 06:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
no one sponsoring this bill represents
 
06:12:23.910 --> 06:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
my district or me
 
06:12:26.310 --> 06:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
i do not want them dictating this level
 
06:12:29.750 --> 06:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
of control over my town schools
 
06:12:31.430 --> 06:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
i don't have kids in the school i'm
 
06:12:35.110 --> 06:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the kids in my town
 
06:12:36.868 --> 06:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
following the logic presented in this
 
06:12:38.310 --> 06:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
bill perhaps we should be considered
 
06:12:40.708 --> 06:12:40.718 align:start position:0%
going really local i don't often get to
 
06:12:42.708 --> 06:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
say i'm too young but i'm four years too
 
06:12:43.990 --> 06:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
young to have gone to a one-room
 
06:12:50.390 --> 06:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:52.070 --> 06:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
in closing
 
06:12:54.390 --> 06:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
i cannot help but wonder if this is in
 
06:12:57.270 --> 06:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
reality an attempt to discredit and
 
06:13:02.070 --> 06:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
i question the actual motivation with
 
06:13:08.070 --> 06:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
this so-called educational bill i
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
believe those have who have written it
 
06:13:12.390 --> 06:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
if you were to be honest in your hearts
 
06:13:16.390 --> 06:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
and heart of hearts heart of hearts
 
06:13:17.990 --> 06:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
you would have to admit that you are
 
06:13:19.590 --> 06:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
attempting something
 
06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
unspeakably unpatriotic and that is to
 
06:13:26.708 --> 06:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
dismantle public education
 
06:13:28.708 --> 06:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
