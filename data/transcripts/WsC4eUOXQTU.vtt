want to introduce the non- gerain
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
amendment since you're the sponsor of it
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
real quick
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
um and then we will conduct the public
 
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
amendment members of the committee Mary
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
Jane walner um State Rep from conquered
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
member of this committee um um
 
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
so a few weeks ago or maybe it's longer
 
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
than that um I learned that when they
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
were looking at when the childcare ADI
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
um providers and the department were
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing um the rules because they're
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
in they're working on rewriting them at
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
this point they came across something
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
that um I think maybe a lot of the
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
childcare providers might not have been
 
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
aware of I'm sure the department the
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
departmentment was but in law child care
 
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
is limited to 13 hours per day except in
 
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 align:start position:0%
emergencies um and in recent recent
 
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
years the work schedules of families has
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
drastically changed um I think we all
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
know particularly in the medical field
 
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
people are working more three day days
 
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
on 12 hours a day um a lot of a lot of
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
families are finding themselves working
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
in um longer shifts and um needing child
 
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
care for many more hours each day um I
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
was at our County commit I was at our
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
County meeting and the um person who
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
runs the Department of Corrections
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
talked about how he has because they are
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
so short staffed they now have have
 
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
every one of their Corrections Officers
 
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:05.879 align:start position:0%
working at least one day a week two
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
eight hour shifts back to
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
back so that's a 16-hour work
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
day right and then they need an hour
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
probably to drop the child off and pick
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
the child up so if one of those
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers did need child care
 
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:25.879 align:start position:0%
there is a real issue here and I think
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing this more and more in um
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
the child care world so um I just took
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
the law and struck out the 13
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
hours and after I did that the
 
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:43.959 align:start position:0%
department let me know that that the
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
problem with that is it could throw
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
Child Care into needing to um be in um
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
compliance with
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
residential with res residential um
 
00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
rules and that is something I don't
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
think that any of us want um so because
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
it would be there would be no limit on
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
the amount of time so after some
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
discussion with um Melissa clemet um
 
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
yesterday we did work out some addition
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
some different wording so on the
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
non-gain amendment I have an amendment
 
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
um so is that confusing
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
enough but I do think I think what
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
Melissa and the legal department at the
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
department came up with actually will
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
work better and I guess we could bring
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
that up at the exec session would that
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
be the way to do that or do you want to
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
see it now I assume well let's do it now
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
U because we're in a stance of public
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
hearing um so I always remind people
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
that the rules exist and we can do what
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
we need to do unless someone objects um
 
00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
so unless somebody's
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
goinging the amendment to the amendment
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh we will do that hearing no objection
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
we will do that okay um so so we just
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
have to hope none of our 400 other
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues object but that's fine
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a whole bunch of them
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
like they look like
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
this printed on
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
my cut and paste real cut and paste okay
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
difference so the difference between
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment I just hand we just handed
 
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959 align:start position:0%
around and um the amendment that the
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
non- derain amendment is that in the
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
last if you go to that last
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
sentence instead of just striking out
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
the 13 hours we leave in the 13 hours
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
except in emergencies we leave that in
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
or situations when the parents or
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
Guardians are working over 13 hours
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
during a 24hour period or parents or
 
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
Guardians are that are deployed by the
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
military so I think the military one is
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
one that the department has been hearing
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
about um families needing longer Child
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
Care during those times so so this is
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm open to questions are
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
there questions on the amendment to the
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
okay hearing none thank you
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
representative oh I'm sorry repres I
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
apologize I didn't see you takes me a
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
second to decide if I actually want to
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
ask a question um are there issues with
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
defining like do the parents have to
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
provide um proof that they're working
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
over 13 hours like every time or is
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure how to freeze I think
 
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
that would be a good I think that would
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
be an excellent question to ask the
 
00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
be an excellent question to ask the
department

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
this this wording did come from the
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
Department uh we talked about we talked
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
about another alternative but then came
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
came back to this one and I think that
 
00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:11.959 align:start position:0%
that would be a good question for them
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
to talk about how they would monitor
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
that um or what what
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
obligation um a provider would have to
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
provide information about children who
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
are there longer so
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Paige so I'm
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
I'm obviously supportive of the goal
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
here I think the the one question I have
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know the concern about the original
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
version of the amendment was about
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
pushing it into sort of this residential
 
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
category of care right
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
and with the military deployment
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
piece the the lawyers who discuss this
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
with you they're not concerned about
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
that with the military deployment piece
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
I I think that the bet that also I think
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
is a better question for the Department
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
Department because they're the ones that
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
have experienced this request I assume
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
um over time and I don't know how long
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
these deployments are are they for six
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
months or are we talking about over the
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
mind uh further
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
questions um my only question so you
 
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
haven't sent this off to OS yet I have
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
not sent it off to OS I would think it
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
would go off as a committee Amendment if
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's what we decide to do oh I imagine
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
um I imagine it would I'm just trying to
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
think about timing um because I'd love
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
to get this um done today so um all
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
right let's uh let's move on to the next
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
unless there's further
 
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
grassie thank you Mr chairman
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative Chuck grassy straford 8
 
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
for the record um I I thank you for
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
getting this before the committee uh
 
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
this was something that my wife
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me after a meeting that she
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
had with the childcare advisory Council
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
and that this was an issue and it's
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
something that I've been familiar
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
with can only work with licensed child
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
care facilities and they're looking at
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
providing services for many single
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
parents who have weekend Duty or the one
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
week Duty uh in the summertime and and
 
00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:20.759 align:start position:0%
uh even some longer term things but they
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
can only deal with licensed Child Care
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
Facilities um years ago when we had an
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
unlicensed child care facility at my
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
house we took uh my wife took care of a
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
lot of um children for nurses at the
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
local hospital and it was many a day
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
that we would get a call that says that
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
so and so called and sick and I have to
 
00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
stay or you know it's going to be a long
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
surgery this afternoon I can't get out
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
um and uh we sometimes kept a child
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
overnight uh but these were parents who
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
had unusual circumstances sometimes you
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know until the last minute but
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
being a family childcare you can do that
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff um when this came up that
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
you can only have for 13 hours we both
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
shook our heads and say what the heck's
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
going on here and and why and it's
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that the department just
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
can't change their rules because I
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
understand they're in the process of
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
fixing their rules right now to get this
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
done and they could put it into rules so
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to maybe deal with this
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
again in the future if we see that what
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing today isn't the correct
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
thing to do um that's why I thought the
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
original amendment was good but the
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment is fine um and you
 
00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:22.839 align:start position:0%
know they may have to work their rules
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
around that but I think it's something
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
that we can uh that we should encourage
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and again uh you know the National
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
Guard is looking at Contracting with
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
childcare agencies to provide services
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
for their
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
soldiers and this is something that
 
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
do questions from the
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
committee none thank you representative

Services

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Barry and members
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Melissa
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
Clement and I am the chief of the
 
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
childcare licensing unit I'm here to
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I've heard some so
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
I'll start there and then we can
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
continue the conversation so when this
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
was brought to our attention we were
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the fact that if a child is
 
00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:21.959 align:start position:0%
in care for longer than 24 hours then
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
that's a residential care it's not just
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
child care which was why we wanted to
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
not eliminate the number of hours of
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
child could be in care but we also
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are times when a
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
child may need to do so we we thought
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
just by striking the 13 hours um would
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
be problematic so we said you know we
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
have the 13 hours accept an emergencies
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
so you have those times when parents
 
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
didn't know they were going to have to
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
work a second shift they called the
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
program hey can I can the child stay
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
longer because I was just asked to stay
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
longer at my position so that's an
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
emergency situation but we also
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are times now as um
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
represent Senator wner brought up that
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
parents are being scheduled for shifts
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
that are longer than the 12-hour shifts
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to make sure we have
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions for that as well we have also
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
heard from um others about the military
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions when we were considering this
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
we were thinking of weekend deployments
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
we weren't thinking of a week or six
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
months so um looking at that we're a
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
little concerned because that's also
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
going to bump you in a residential care
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
if a child is in something longer so
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to strike that balance um
 
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.870 align:start position:0%
we're trying to strike that balance um
my

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation and Dorian shley the
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
manager um is here also and maybe she
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
can speak to this but we were just
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
confirming back there maybe having um
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
changing the wording so that it says or
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
parents or
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
Guardians um who are deployed during
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
weekend deployments um we were thinking
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
that's maybe a you know to specify that
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's not someone who's deployed for 6
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
months a year that that a child is being
 
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
placed in a Child Care Program 24 hours
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
a day and also um programs have to be
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
licensed as um in addition to their
 
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
child daycare there's a night
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
care license that they would have to um
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
be approved for and that would include
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
approval through the fire department
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
locals for to operate those type of
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
hours this statute itself talks about
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
the number of hours each child can be
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
and the reason we didn't want to strike
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
13 is that we believe as an agency it
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense for to have some limit on
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
the number of hours a child individual
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
child could be in care not necessarily
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
the number of hours that a program can
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
operate a program can operate up to 24
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
hours if they're licensed appropriately
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
but each child has to be there for only
 
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
a certain number of hours and not there
 
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.070 align:start position:0%
a certain number of hours and not there
24

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
hours and any additional
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I was I'm sorry I was I'm
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
trying to bring up the rules for night
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
care while you were talking about night
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
care like yes trying to remember what
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
section it was I don't have operate
 
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
nightcare so I'm not as familiar with it
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
um yeah and under the statute RSA
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
1702 um those are the definitions of
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
child care programs and there's a night
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
Care Agency definition in statute as
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
well in the stat what's the RSA again
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry RSA 170 e colon 2 okay um
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
under the definitions
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay so just are there sorry are the
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee while I
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
frantically read these rules yes uh
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
president Phil thank you for coming um I
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if he wants water right now
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
sorry just um I actually agree with your
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the amendment to the
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
amendment about um not to trimming it
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
down to weekend appointments National
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
Guard I just think the committee should
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
consider that because I I definitely
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
think that that's an arrangement where
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
you get a family member or friend to
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
take your child if you are a single
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
parent deploying um that I totally agree
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
with you so I just wanted to kind of
 
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
make a comment more than a question I
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
guess um thank you thank you uh further
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee um seeing none it just so it
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
looks like the rules for night care are
 
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
about evening hour operations 7 p.m. to
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
5 a.m. yeah so sleeping Arrangements
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
those type of things what needs to be
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
provided overnight yeah so if they were
 
00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:24.390 align:start position:0%
provided overnight yeah so if they were
provided

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
so putting this together in my head
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
because I didn't think I should have
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
thought about night care for this it was
 
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
my fault um I didn't I knew you had to
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
have a special thing for night care I
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
just my brain didn't go hey look good
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
into that um so if this goes into place
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
children placed under this care it's
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
emergency or military they would need a
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm wondering if it would just
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
make uh let me read the I haven't read
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
the RSA you said it was RSA 760e if you
 
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
want to sit down it's just going to take
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
me a second I in hrsa
 
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
170 in case you guys think good question
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah ask question how was your weekend
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
um of course yeah of course um I uh
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
experienced this with an employee who
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
was a National Guards member two young
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
kids during Co actually and she had
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
Regan deployments and she struggled very
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
much to find someone and obviously it
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
ended up being a
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
unlicensed um neighbor daycare situation
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
who could take her children you know
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
very early in the morning like 5:00 a.m.
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't see them again until
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the weekend so um I I I'm
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
actually delighted to hear that National
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
Guard is looking for people to provide
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
the childcare because I think our
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
National Guards people have families and
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is a huge issue these weekend
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
deployments so um anything we can do to
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
make that easier I think the committee
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
should definitely prioritize so okay all
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
right I am now informed um okay so RSA
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
170e which is just general definitions
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
just defines night care agency and ACC
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
agency means a
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
family to 40 then goes to define the
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
hour so the RSA makes this kind of broad
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
definition and the rules tighten that
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
definition up to a actually defines
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
evening hours as 7 to five um so I guess
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
I guess my since we're going have to
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
send this off to ol us anyways I guess
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to make it more just
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
in line with everything because like
 
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
here we're defining number of hours and
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
then night care agents is being defined
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
by set hours not a total number but a
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
set 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. um so I'm wondering
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
if that would just make since we're
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
already going to be tinkering with this
 
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
and I didn't in my brain I was like I
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to conquer this up but I feel
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
like we might conquer this up um would
 
00:22:48.669 --> 00:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
it make more sense
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
to to just to to I I guess what would be
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
the arguments just like having it all
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
line up well I was going to ask what it
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
makes sense to kind of go back to the
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
original language and instead of
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
Striking 13 completely just change 13 to
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
24 to bring it in line
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
with that it wouldn't go into
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
residential care or sorry yeah sure so
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
the difference between the night care
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
agency that is the license type that a
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
program is operated under and those are
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
the hours that they operate under this
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
statute talks about how many hours an
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
individual child can be in care versus
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
the amount of hours that a program is
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
operating so I want to make sure we that
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
distinction is clear but because take
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
taking the night Care Agency hours and
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
plopping it here wouldn't solve the
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
problem or solve the conversation about
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
how many hours a child can be in care
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
versus when a program can operate you
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
you explain that excellently thank you
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay now that makes sense in my head
 
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much okay all right so yes
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
that that makes way more sense to do it
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
like this um and uh and any other
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee we're going
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
to be have a weird awkward recess till
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
11 but
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
uh what yeah we need the adment anyways
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
okay um so I guess the agent what is the
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
agency stance do you want the amendment
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
to the amendment or do you want the
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment what's the agency
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
stance the amendment to the amendment
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
would be preferable I think it gives the
 
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
greatest flexibility for any emergency
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
that CS pops up plus the additional
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
protections or additional ability for
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
families that are working longer and
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
have those military deployments for a
 
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
weekend is what I would recommend unless
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
it's strong objections okay um all right
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
any other questions and I just learned
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
about night agencies all right um thank
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
you that's it uh all right the committee
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
is I guess we're done with the public
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't have any other pink card
 
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
signed up uh do we have a blue sheet I
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't see anything on the blue sheet I
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
don't do they put uh do do I don't see
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
anything written on it I don't think so
 
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
so the blue sheets empty um NH I don't
 
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
think that this is an online submission
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
thing but we'll take a
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
look I think I'm like the only chair
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
that reads the online submissions um no
 
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
who else does
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
it oh they verbalize it okay read I read
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
them I'm I'm a nerd I'm I'm a nerd uh
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
let's see if they have a non derain I
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
just don't even know if they have a non-
 
00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:14.430 align:start position:0%
just don't even know if they have a non-
derain

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
derain
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
section um I don't see it I don't see a
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
non-main section um so I don't know so
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
anyway for the for the bill there was
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
eight people that support and two
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
opposed it I I don't know if that's for
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment or for the under actual
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
original bill um with that we'll close
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
the public hearing for 1056 and um I
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
believe representative walner you'll
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
work to get this over OLS on a rush um
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
so we can take care of
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
it yeah just and I'll work on committee
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
reports while I sit here um all right
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.679 --> 01:01:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
11:

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:12:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
oh wow if they did a better job of
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
drafting the non- gerain non-gain
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that they could never seen
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
coming okay we're going to open up for
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
executive session for the house special
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
committee on Child Care um we're waiting
 
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.270 align:start position:0%
committee on Child Care um we're waiting
on

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
1056 didn't we already do 1657 we did
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
already do so we don't need to do
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
1657 I think why are
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
weting uh because she has the amend
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
it that was the non-main amendment the
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of this
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
morning it's
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
um was
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
14 okay yeah this one we can start
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
working on okay so let's open up the
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 1409
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
relative to to review by The Advisory
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
Council on child
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
care I'm going to read this again
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
relative to review by the advis by The
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
Advisory Council on child care of child
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
care center licensing violations I
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
believe this bill was recessed we were
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
in an itl
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
disposition um and DHHS said that they
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
were going to get a draft rule proposal
 
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
to us uh which they did so I know that
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
we are in executive session but without
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
objection I would like to bring dhh up
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
to present uh what they have worked on
 
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
um which would obviously supplant the
 
01:14:07.229 --> 01:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
need for this bill they did send it to
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
us last night so if you guys want to
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
come up and show us what you
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you chairman Barry and
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um for the
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
record I'm Melissa Clement I'm the chief
 
01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
of the childcare licensing unit um so
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
what I um sent last night to um the
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
was a draft proposal of the rule that we
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
would add to our childcare licensing
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
rules we are currently revising those
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
rules with the childcare advisory
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
Council and other members of the Child
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
Care community so there is there will be
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
an additional section for what we are
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
calling an independent informal dispute
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
resolution that process would start
 
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
after doing an informal dispute
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
resolution um which is the dispute
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
resolution brought to the department
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
then if the provider wishes after that
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution they could further um
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
ask for another independent dispute with
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
the childcare advisory Council in a
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
panel that was developed between the
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory Council child care
 
01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
licensing that panel would include a
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
member of the childcare advisory Council
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
the members would be made up of child
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
care providers that are licensed and
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
have you know are in good standing so we
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
would choose ask for volunteers choose
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
among them have um a process where three
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
to five people would be chosen out of a
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
pool that we would have and um this
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
whole policy and procedure was developed
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
using a federal procedure for certified
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid providers through our um Bureau
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
our Licensing Bureau for healthare
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
facilities um CMS they also have this
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
process so we use that as our model um
 
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
essentially we're asking for a panel of
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
peers to review the decisions that we
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
made with the um what the provider is
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
disputing and then that decision will be
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
brought from the panel to the department
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
for review that was sorry a very quick
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
summary does anyone have any questions
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
on it are there
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
questions um yeah I have some thank you
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
for answering my question last night
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
that was very nice it was late too um so
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
I just want to kind of like walk through
 
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
what this would I understand this is the
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
draft I understand that there's probably
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
still working that's still working like
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
so I accept all of that and I accept all
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
that this is being done in good faith so
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to walk kind of through the
 
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
process like so there's a finding by a
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
licenser the center provider probably
 
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
provider is a better Term Provider can
 
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
then appeal it then goes to the
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
IDR right yes and the IDR upholds or
 
01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
overturn return Returns the finding MH
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
assuming the finding is upheld then the
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
provider can then appeal to the
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
iidr um and that I
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
iidr is a panel of three to five
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
providers uh would that just be a
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
standing pool would that be a standing
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
like three to five different what we're
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
envisioning now because we know not
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to be available and
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
there's time frames for needing to
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
respond so we want to get a pool of
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 12 15 something like that
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
depending on the response we get and
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
then once an request comes in we would
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
do our best to match the provider who is
 
01:17:36.669 --> 01:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
doing the dispute with the people who
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
are on the panel that have programs like
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
there so it's a family child care
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
provider if it's a school age provider
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
we'll do our best to find someone on the
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
panel who will match those um so that is
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
the process one point of clarification
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
and I understand it's semantics but we
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
live and die by our um wording these are
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
not appeals because appeals have an
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
official appeals process through DHHS
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
and that is for our enforcement actions
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
against licenses this is why we call it
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
an informal dispute because it is not an
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
appeal process okay it's like it's an
 
01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:11.310 align:start position:0%
appeal process okay it's like it's an
independent

01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
review it's informal review not it is
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
different it's not the same but it is
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
similar yes got it um that's totally
 
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
fine um because I do there is a Bonafide
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
appeals process yes correct okay so um
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
they don't appeal but they request a um
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
dispute dispute review well that's the
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
proper term right um so they they
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
request a dispute review so that leads
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
from my understanding from reading what
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
was sent um that leads to two possible
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes um but let's go over what that
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
dispute review would look like so um
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
they can only consider evidence that was
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
presented at the time of the visit is
 
01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.790 align:start position:0%
presented at the time of the visit is
that

01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
correct that um I'm looking at just
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're on the same page I'm on on the
 
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
J

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
J
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um that the evidence presented
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
existed at the time of the visit so it
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
has to be evidence that should have been
 
01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
available maybe for some reason our
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
reviewer didn't see it so but had to
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
have existed at the time the citation
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
was found as opposed
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
to documents being created after the
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
fact okay to demonstrate compliance but
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
they were not available at the time the
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
finding was made yeah so an example of
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
this would be like um if you came
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
looking for a signed copy of the
 
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
expulsion policy right and you didn't
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
have it and then magically it appeared
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know two weeks later postdated right
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
and it's magically all worse so like we
 
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:51.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to consider that
 
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have it right on
 
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
them at the time um okay so they would
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
okay so that that that makes sense right
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
you can't just re you can't just
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
introduce you're not escalating a
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
dispute process
 
01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
um determin determine whether there is a
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
Prepon of evidence the citation did or
 
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
occur determine why the evidence
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
presented creates a change material
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
facts okay so two and three no issue
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
there um so from there there's two
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes they say yes this finding was
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
accurate or no the iidr believes this
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
finding was inaccurate so obviously if
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
they find it it was in is accurate
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's the end of that we move on um if
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
they let's talk about what happens if
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
the iidr says no uh the Department's
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
gotten this wrong now twice right
 
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
because it's the licenser was wrong and
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
the IDR was wrong y um so now what
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
happens let's walk into the process what
 
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
happens next sure so what we're
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
proposing is that um the iidr decision
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
comes back to us and then as a
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
department we're also reviewing it to
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that the decision that was
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
made met that criteria okay and then
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
from there if we agree that it meets
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
that criteria we would remove the
 
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
finding okay if we don't feel it meets
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
that criteria we would write our
 
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
decision we would put that in writing we
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
would send our decision with the panel's
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
decision to the program so that is full
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
transparency as to what occurred and
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
that remains in the file okay so that so
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
there's so now there's this the
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
department disagrees with the
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
iidr it goes in so what what can happen
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
with that information now because this
 
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
isn't an appeals process right there is
 
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
a formal appeals process so can the can
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
that finding of the iidr be used in the
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
formal appeals process could I as a
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
provider go in and say well the iidr
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
actually disagreed with the department
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
they agreed with me like or is that is
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
it just done so these are the things
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
that that could happen with that at that
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
point there's not a further appeals
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
process there could be in the future if
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
say say the program um I'm trying to
 
01:22:11.229 --> 01:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
think um didn't complete whatever the
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
finding was if we choose in the future
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
to maybe it's a repeat citation we find
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
them non-complying again or there's
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
other um citations further down the road
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
we could choose we could find the
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
program we could take it to an
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
enforcable action and then at that point
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
we because we're relying on information
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
from this disputed finding yeah if
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
that's the case once they get to that
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
appeals process they can appeal it there
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the aaou to yeah and
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
they could but they could introduce this
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
as a they they could use this in their
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
effectively they could use this in their
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
in their defense absolutely and the
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
other piece to that too in addition to
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
our process so say we don't um remove
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
the citation they program also has the
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
ability to um give us a written
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
statement that we post with their
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
corrective action so they could choose
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
to further bring this um to the public
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
by saying we went through this process
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
this is why we don't think we should
 
01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:09.639 align:start position:0%
have been cited that is something that
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're able to do in a written
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
statement they have to provide a
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan to show that they
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
fixed it but they're also able in our
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
rules now currently to have and in the
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
statute they're able to have a written
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
statement that's posted online with
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
their information I also want to um
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
bring forth that out of the idrs that we
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
completed in
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
2023 um there were we only had eight of
 
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
them but out of those there was only out
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
of those eight there's only one that
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
remained as cited so as a department we
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
do regularly either remove the citations
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
we did that three times we um mix we had
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
a mix of removing citation or revising
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
evidence because there are times when we
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
have several pieces of evidence it may
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
be that there's 's a piece of evidence
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
that we remove but the overall citation
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
might still remain or we may just revise
 
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
evidence only and we did that one time
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
so we do I I want to say we do often
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
remove change when these things come to
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
us so it's not yeah just so you have
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
that understanding as well yeah okay um
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
are there further
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
questions the committee yes RS and wmer
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't have a question I just
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
have a comment I think this is a really
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
big step forward for for child here to
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
have this and to include providers who
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
actually do this work I think it's
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
really really good and I'm sure as time
 
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
goes by you'll you'll probably be back
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
to Tinker with it a little bit but yes
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for doing this
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
work and thanks to providers who worked
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
on it yeah no I really appreciate the
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
work of the childcare advisory council
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
with us on this and the providers so
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you appre thank you chair thanks
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um is there any
 
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh remuneration or or anything like that
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
for the providers who are going to serve
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
on this panel or is it just a straight
 
01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
volunteer it's a straight volunteer as
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's presented right
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
now um any other further questions about
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
this policy on this bill um I'm G to I
 
01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
want to Echo what representative walner
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
said um I do think this is a big step
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
forward um I do think this accomplishes
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
the goal of the bill um which was to
 
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.990 align:start position:0%
the goal of the bill um which was to
bring

01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
bring
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
a sense of fair I'm not and I'm not
 
01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:25.719 align:start position:0%
accusing the department of being unfair
 
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
but bringing a sense of fairness to that
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
process um so personally I believe that
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
this will suffice for what I was looking
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
for from the industry standpoints I
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
think the CC talk advisor Comm you guys
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
agree I take it um okay so that I I I
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
think I know and I accept that this is
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
still being work and it's being done I'm
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
going to take on good faith that it's
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
being done um so I thank you and I think
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's a Well already very well thought
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
out um so you're it's not even that
 
01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
you're close I think you're almost
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
done thank you very much okay any other
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
questions before we go okay thank you so
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you okay so with that we
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
are on an itl disposition on
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
um 14 House Bill
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
1409 um I believe I made that motion I
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
see no reason to withdraw that motion um
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
is there any objection any other
 
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
comments on the bill the motion of
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislated on House Bill
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
1409 second I think it had a second but
 
01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
it um because we were on discussion on
 
01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
the bill so we had to have had a second
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
um sure uh anyway so if the clerk's
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%

to
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
legislate um I assume we still haven't
 
01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
1056 you want to go grab it real
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
fast anyone want to volunteer to do the
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
report I can take care I'm already I'm
 
01:27:42.109 --> 01:27:42.119 align:start position:0%
already writing every I'm already
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
writing election law half of election
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
law reports fire off a this one won't
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
nearly be as long as the one that I just
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
did this one be like 1405
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
yeah handled by
 
01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.590 align:start position:0%
yeah handled by
rules

01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
um okay and we've done 1567 I don't know
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
why that was Ren
 
01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.750 align:start position:0%
why that was Ren
noticed

01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
noticed
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
um I probably was supposed to do the
 
01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
report for 1567 and
 
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
didn't so which leaves us with just two
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
more bills
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe we've been let me see
 
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
if we've been sent anything while we're
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
waiting for representative
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
walner let me see if we've been sent
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
anything from our friends in the Senate
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
have of Howard gets to watch me in
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
like that's between having 41 bills and
 
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.669 align:start position:0%
like that's between having 41 bills and
having

01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
six yeah we don't do any yeah well I was
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
telling yesterday I was like it's a
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
totally different world there where it's
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
like it you know it's going to be a 101
 
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
vote it's like you know want talk no all
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
right call the vote no yes move
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
on the the the committee the committee
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
reports are always hilarious for those
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
because it's like and the and the
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
majority of the Committees believed was
 
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
like there was no discussion like how
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
did you have any any inclination was
 
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
happening um no nothing from the Senate
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
so yeah that'll be the end of it today
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
will probably be our last day unless
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
they sent us something from the Senate
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry you don't enjoy this I I I
 
01:29:25.709 --> 01:29:25.719 align:start position:0%
this is actually I've told election law
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
this is actually my this is actually my
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
favorite committee
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's it's well like here it's
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
like you know we we do things like we
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
actually get things done there's stuff
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
gets accomplished election law is just
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
like it's like it's just you know get
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
there at 9: do this until noon go eat
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
lunch come back at one o'clock go back
 
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
to doing this go back to doing
 
01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
this it's a different uh it's a
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
different world I think we're only going
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
to have one contentious vote will be the
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
last one we do um which not bad for a
 
01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
whole two years of work only have one
 
01:30:01.239 --> 01:30:14.790 align:start position:0%
whole two years of work only have one
contentious

01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
vote really oh was that that was
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
probably a jumbled up vote well there
 
01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:20.830 align:start position:0%
probably a jumbled up vote well there
was

01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.470 align:start position:0%
was
some

01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
now I'll be interested to see the roll
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
call on that one it's always I I I
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
always love those issues that
 
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.950 align:start position:0%
always love those issues that
don't

01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I always like those issues that
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
just cut across party lines like that's
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
one of those weird ones right um those I
 
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
always find those things to be so
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
fascinating um another one of those is
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
like cannabis legalization cuts across
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
party lines it's a weird one um um you
 
01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
there's no uh man is this going to be
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
200 or is this going to be
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
196 all right represent of wner do you
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
have your Amendment so the amendment to
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:24.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it's like uh I take all these phone
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
calls in my Cher Center this I'm right
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
outside the infant room so there's a lot
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
of crying in the background and people
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
are like you need a go like I don't even
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
I it's not it's like it's it's like it's
 
01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:39.719 align:start position:0%
like white noise I don't even hear it um
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
you know I could tell the difference
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
between the like I want attention cry
 
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
and the like I'm in danger cry and
 
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
that's they do sound differently um okay
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to open up the
 
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
executive session on how Bill 1056 uh
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative walner we were on the
 
01:31:59.790 --> 01:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
amendment um representative walner had
 
01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:12.830 align:start position:0%
amendment um representative walner had
moved

01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
2024-the um and then you can introduce
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
the new Amendment to the amendment great
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
I will uh withdraw the first am the non-
 
01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
terain amendment okay and we can move to
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
the next Amendment all right so you're
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
so representative wner is moving 202
 
01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.550 align:start position:0%
so representative wner is moving 202

01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
non gerain hearing on this um is there
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.109 --> 01:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative Nelson
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Mr chairman I I don't have
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
a copy of that Amendment oh it's
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay you didn't want to read it right
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
whatever does everybody have copies of
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
one no this is
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
wer okay and there's a stack of them
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
here's here's the actual so so the the
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
the 995 is different than the one we
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
heard today it is substantially similar
 
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
but it is um the same subject in the
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
same RSA so it's definitely yeah
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it is a little different um okay so
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
2024-25 6 is a discussion on the
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
amendment uh repr Warner I I think the
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
amendment reads just the way we uh
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
discussed it Y and um do would allow
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
children whose parents work more than 13
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
hours to be in a Child Care Program and
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
allow for children to be in a a Child
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
Care Program if their parents were
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
deployed during the weekend by the
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
Phillips my only um question is um when
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
it says by the weekend some of these um
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
weekend deployments are three days does
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
that matter it's a long
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
weekend um so I'm just throwing it out
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
there because I just happen to have an
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
employee who had to go through all yeah
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very it's a technical question so
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
um I I had the same thought and I didn't
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
want to send it like back again um so I
 
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
think well you had the thought before me
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
so you should have brought it up yeah I
 
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
know I know um I did um I what what my
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
game plan was on this was to use the
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
legislative intent mechanism um and just
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
State what our intent is with it um and
 
01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
that should suffice because a weekend is
 
01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
not defined anywhere a weekend can be
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
three days you can take a long weekend
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
um so I was going to say that and I'm
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
glad you actually brought that up
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
because I was going to say two things is
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
I was going to say uh I am voting for
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment is my intention is voting
 
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
on this amendment is that it includes
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
long weekends for military deployments
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
the other thing I was going to say is is
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh my intention in voting on this is it
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
includes all definitions of the military
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
so the dod and the um National Guard New
 
01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard if you are
 
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
doing military things all of them all
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
the branches the Navy the MC all of them
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm voting this with the intention that
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
they are all included in there and I'm
 
01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
assuming that that's going to go in the
 
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
notes which means when it if it never
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
goes to court they'll look at that and
 
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
say what the legislative intent was so
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
we'll hopefully the courts read what
 
01:36:08.669 --> 01:36:08.679 align:start position:0%
representative creation writes down um
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
but yes I had the same
 
01:36:14.189 --> 01:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
thought any other further um comments
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions concerns on the amendment okay
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
with that the clerk will call the role
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
on the amendment um and then we'll have
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%

01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%

01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah if we could do it I know
 
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
you're busy but if we could do it I'd
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
love to be get this on the not this
 
01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
Thursday but next um okay so with that
 
01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to come to our last bill
 
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
which I think will I don't know but I
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
think will be our only Bill where we
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
likely take a divided vote um so before
 
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
we do that I want to say thank you if we
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
don't meet again I want to say thank you
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
to this committee I believe we' actually
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
done some really like awesome things for
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
the industry as a whole um we may meet
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
again uh so this may not the the goodbye
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
speech but it could be the goodbye
 
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
speech um so I was just saying uh while
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
we were in break uh I've really enjoyed
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
the deposition of this versus my other
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
committee where we do this um it's been
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
a pleasure working with everyone and I
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
do think we have produced some excellent
 
01:38:39.310 --> 01:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
work product that I do believe will
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
impact uh the child care system in New
 
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so with those lovely
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
uniting Works say I believe we're going
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
to take our one divided vote
 
01:38:51.149 --> 01:38:51.159 align:start position:0%
um and and there's a reason why I helped
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
held it to last um so I will open up the
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
1584 um uh since I'm down a number we'll
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
just skip to the part where
 
01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
motion I'll move
 
01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
inexpedient representative walner moves
 
01:39:13.629 --> 01:39:13.639 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate is there a
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
second I'll second repres page second
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
um as I
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this is the bill that would um
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
increase the number of uh children that
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
a provider could have before they would
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
need licensed um right now you can have
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
three children U plus your own children
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
um in order to not need a license your
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
license exempt at that point this moves
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
it up to four children that are
 
01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
unrelated um my feeling is that we do
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to be sure that kids
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
are in Safe Care um the more we erode
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
these um ratios and these um licenses
 
01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
the more likely we're going to have
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
incidents the fire marshal did send us
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
some stuff I was sort of sorry that they
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
aren't here um to kind of talk about the
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
safety of children children this
 
01:40:29.589 --> 01:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
and this bill actually I think does
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
bring forth a safety concern for
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
especially the youngest kids it's very
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
hard to imagine you're in a second floor
 
01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
apartment and you're going to get four
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
very very young children out of that
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
apartment safely if there was a fire so
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
or if there was some emergency so that's
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
the reason the other the other other
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
reason I've been thinking about is we do
 
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
provide some
 
01:41:01.229 --> 01:41:01.239 align:start position:0%
safeguards particularly around the um
 
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
police checks and the security checks
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we do on all child care providers
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
and that means this is a group of people
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
caring for children where there'll be no
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
no um records checks to be sure that
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
they don't um provide a threat to
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
children so um I think that's a concern
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're just increasing the number of
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
children who are in places that don't
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
have these
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
safeguards further comments from the
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
committee on the bill um okay I'll I'll
 
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
give my I I respect what the member said
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
I actually agree with a lot of the
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
points um the principles of it are not
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
misguided or misb at all um you have to
 
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
juxtapose that with the the issue of you
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
look at the members who are on this bill
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
they are mostly members from rural
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
communities these are the areas that
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
have the hardest time finding access to
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
child care and it is a it is it's like
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
with a lot of things right you're OB
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
you're obviously you're always balancing
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
safety and quality against access and
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
affordability these two things are
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
often in direct conflict with each other
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
so the question is is where do you where
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
do you fall right no one on this
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee wants
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
safe non quality child care no one on
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
this committee wants child care to be
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
inaccessible or inable we all hold those
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
two positions and this is the one bill
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
where you kind of see where that
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
dividing line is as where do you end up
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
falling um neither side is wrong um
 
01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
they're both rights to their own merits
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
I am choosing access and affordability
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
in this instance um because I don't
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the compromises to safety
 
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
and quality which would exist um
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
outweigh the current lack of access and
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
affordability um I hold the
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
socialization not the social I I told a
 
01:42:59.950 --> 01:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
joke on the radio day not the socialism
 
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
isation of the child but the
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
socialization of the child um at a very
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
high regard um in the development of a
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
child and I know that parents who can't
 
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
afford or find accessible Child Care
 
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
their child not only is it a financial
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
strain on the New Hampshire economy by
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
that person not reentering the workforce
 
01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:19.639 align:start position:0%
but it's also a detriment to that child
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
because that child loses those
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
socialization skills um and the other
 
01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
thing is is like while this is an
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
unlicensed Arena um children do tend to
 
01:43:29.709 --> 01:43:29.719 align:start position:0%
be in a safer environment um when
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're around perennial caregivers um
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
so I respect everything the member says
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
I want to thank the member for all the
 
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
great work I believe we've done um and I
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want this bill to leave us
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
in a bad a bad disposition we're still
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
friends I think um we just we just
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
happen to have this this is the one
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
where the dividing line um Drew Drew um
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
which is why I intentionally kept did
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
towards the very end so I'll be voting
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
against the motion of inexpedient to
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
legislate that's my that's my reasoning
 
01:43:58.830 --> 01:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
um and we'll let the we'll let the house
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
floor decide where this one goes yes
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative CR thank you um I will
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
just say I would not be opposed
 
01:44:08.669 --> 01:44:08.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily to increasing to four if
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
there were also Provisions for you know
 
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
the the ages of of the children um or or
 
01:44:17.229 --> 01:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
something like that but I guess that
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
gets to licensing um I just feel like a
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
blanket increase to to for is not
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
something that I can vote for y fair
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
enough represent
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
paig thank you and I I think I'm the
 
01:44:30.669 --> 01:44:30.679 align:start position:0%
only person on committee representing a
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
pretty rural area of the state and I
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
will say that I really wanted to support
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
this bill um and I'm sad that our
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
committee work is coming to an end
 
01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
because we have so much more to do um
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
and I think you know my response as
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
someone from a rural area who
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
experiences these things is we need to
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
continue to do more
 
01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:52.870 align:start position:0%
continue to do more
to

01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
facilitate um the creation of more
 
01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
family and group Family Care and so I
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
think that there are there are ways we
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
could have our cake and eat it to on
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
this and so what I'd hope is that
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
however this comes out we keep working
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
with each other on this issue because it
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
is an important one um and we've been
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
working so well together so uh looking
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
ahead to next year anyone who wants to
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
work with me on on family and group
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
Family Care I'd love to do that and I I
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
totally agree with all that the family
 
01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
and group care in our when we did our
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
our listening sessions that was to me
 
01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:29.719 align:start position:0%
the obvious solution for those rural
 
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
communities right because they don't
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
they don't have the populations to
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
support larger centers um so the the
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
family group CARE is the obvious and I'm
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
very proud We got that new license type
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
introduced um that's that I believe is
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
going to do a lot of good as well um so
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate that and I I recognize
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
that that's like I said this was this
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
was a tough one where it was like yeah
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
you going to pick a side on this one and
 
01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
it just kind of is what it is and that's
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay um yes represent wner I do want to
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
say that I do think that that it'll be
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
interesting to see if the zoning uh law
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
that we are passing I think that may go
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
a long way in helping providers um
 
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
increase the number of family childcare
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
providers and communities I I I
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
completely agree and I said I think
 
01:46:11.709 --> 01:46:11.719 align:start position:0%
we've done what to see what this what
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
our friends on the other side of the
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
wall do to our hard work um but um I I I
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
do genuinely believe you know it's not
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
often in conquer you can go home and be
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
like I did something good today um I
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
genuinely believe the work that this
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
committee has done did some good and we
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
did some good today even though we're
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
going to disagree on this one um all
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
right so with that the uh clerk will
 
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
call the role on the motion of
 
01:46:36.669 --> 01:46:36.679 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on House Bill
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
