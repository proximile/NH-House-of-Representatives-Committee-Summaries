welcomes you back thank you oh thanks
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman in 1990 uh the federal
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
government passed the gun free school
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
zone bill
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
it was the Assumption of law enforcement
 
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
and local school districts that that
 
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
bill would cover them in New Hampshire
 
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
and a few years ago before then attorney
 
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
general Gordon McDonald was elevated to
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
he issued an opinion to local law
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement that said no you cannot
 
00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
really enforce the Federal Gun free
 
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
school zone bill that has to be done by
 
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
federal agents
 
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
and so for the past three years we've
 
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
been somewhat in a uh gray area as to
 
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm proposing today would be
 
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire's version of gun free
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
school zone
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
and let me just say Mr chairman I speak
 
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
today is someone who is not empty gun
 
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.270 align:start position:0%
today is someone who is not empty gun
um

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
believe it or not I've been a licensed
 
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 align:start position:0%
hunter in New Hampshire for 60 years now
 
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm really that old and uh
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
all during my working career I carried a
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
firearm three years in the military here
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
in Vietnam as a conquered police officer
 
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
than 26 years with US Marshals
 
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.490 align:start position:0%
than 26 years with US Marshals
um

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
I was a past member of the Alderbrook
 
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
Sportsman's Club
 
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.650 align:start position:0%
Sportsman's Club
so

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
this isn't any anti-gun legislation the
 
00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is to keep guns out of
 
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
school that shouldn't be there
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
um I tried it in developing this bill
 
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
take into mind the fact that when I was
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
in high school I used to go deer hunting
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
after school and you bring your gun to
 
00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
school and go hunt this bill allows for
 
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
people to bring a vehicle on the school
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
grounds with a weapon in it it's just
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
got to be secured the same with someone
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
visiting the office they can have their
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
gun secured in their vehicle and they're
 
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.050 align:start position:0%
gun secured in their vehicle and they're
fine

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
I try to put the penalties as minimum as
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
I could uh first offense is a B
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor uh second offense is an aid
 
00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:58.610 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor uh second offense is an aid
misdemeanor

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
and then if your third time you
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
obviously don't understand then it go
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
elevates to a felony
 
00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.129 align:start position:0%
elevates to a felony
um

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
I introduced this bill
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
because I've got
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
two kids and grandchildren in school my
 
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
17 year old daughter is in high school
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
I'm a 12 year old grandson is in Middle
 
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.210 align:start position:0%
I'm a 12 year old grandson is in Middle
School

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
School
 
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
I can't understand
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
why any responsible gun lawyer and
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
concern and to any student this season
 
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.689 align:start position:0%
concern and to any student this season
thinking

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
is this going to be the day that I die
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
because the national violence we've all
 
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.850 align:start position:0%
because the national violence we've all
seen

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
so Mr Jim and I know you've got a lot of
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
work today I'm going to end there I hope
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
the committee will support this bill and
 
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'd be very glad to answer any questions
 
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative Manion
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:07:57.129 --> 00:07:57.139 align:start position:0%
I don't see any time
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
restraints on this so if it's two in the
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
morning and you're driving within a
 
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
thousand feet of a school zone this
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
applies to you as well
 
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
if you're driving through a school zone
 
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
yeah it doesn't Supply to you as well
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
within a thousand feet of a school at
 
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
say two in the morning I don't see
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
anything in here that allows it that
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
restricts it only during school hours
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
exactly I think a lot of times school
 
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
activities can go for great periods of
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
time uh from High School proms and
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
dances to basketball games things of
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
that nature if you're driving through
 
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539 align:start position:0%
driving past the school you're fine it's
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
when you're stopping at the school and
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
you're going to go you know you're on
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
actual school property that uh
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
the law would take effect that you've
 
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:38.459 align:start position:0%
got to secure your weapon
 
00:08:38.459 --> 00:08:39.769 align:start position:0%
got to secure your weapon
it

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up thought one follow-up
 
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
am I understanding it wrong it says one
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
at a thousand feet of a school so that
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
would mean beyond the school's actual
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
physical property
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
if you are
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
in a field or well the bill makes it
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
exemption for example a local homeowner
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
or somebody traveling through going from
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
point A to point B driving by the school
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
it's when you stop and pop down the
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
street we've seen that sadly we saw that
 
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
in Texas recently with a perpetrator
 
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.449 align:start position:0%
in Texas recently with a perpetrator
Pact

00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
Pact
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
probably a quarter of a mile away and
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
then walk to the school with this long
 
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
gun that's when the law would take
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
effect but if you're going from point A
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
to point B or if you're a homeowner or a
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
business then you'd be exempt from this
 
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.329 align:start position:0%
business then you'd be exempt from this
law

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for your introducing bill this

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tom minion I
 
00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro One Pelham I'm here
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
to testify in opposition to HP 32.
 
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
this common expression I use when
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
discussing why I carry when seconds
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
count the police are only only minutes
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
away this bill prohibits the type of
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
personal rapid response in a crisis
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
situation anywhere near a school it
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
creates a publicly advertised soft
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
target in other states with similar
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
Provisions this is the exact type of
 
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
area where mass shooting events occur
 
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
places where there is the least amount
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
of resistance from law-abiding citizens
 
00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459 align:start position:0%
that obey these ordinances
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
the Bill's shifts responsibility of
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
Defense of life entirely onto law
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement and while it's more
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
comfortable to think that the Vivaldi
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
Police Department is the only Department
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
that would wait outside the school for
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
hours and tase you if you try to enter
 
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
to do their job for them I'm not
 
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
confident that would be the case
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
you see Courts at all levels have
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
repeatedly affirmed that law enforcement
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
are under no obligation to risk their
 
00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579 align:start position:0%
lives to save yours or the lives of your
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
loved ones
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
I know the reaction to mass shooting
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
events is to do something and I agree
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
but this is not the right something to
 
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
do the solution to this problem is not
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
to prevent teachers janitors counselors
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
or parents from on site from being the
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
first respond in a crisis situation
 
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm of the opinion that the more
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
teachers that more teachers should take
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
firearm training and carry
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
to me it is akin to any other emergency
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
situation learning the Heimlich maneuver
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
CPR automatic defibrillator usage
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
what to do in case of a fire Etc
 
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
I don't believe in mandating carry but
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
administrations being more encouraging
 
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.750 align:start position:0%
administrations being more encouraging
but

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
administrations being more encouraging
 
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
for it and including training courses
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
for those that are interested would be
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
nothing but beneficial with that I ask
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
you to itl HP 32 and I'm willing to take
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:58.670 align:start position:0%

it to the end
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
um at this point I'm not going to limit
 
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
testimony but if it gets too much I'm
 
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
going to have to put a Time cap on them
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can all get out of here
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
before the sun goes down hopefully so if
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
you have a card please bring it forward
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
and you may commence thank you
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
I just want to quickly testify that
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
Firearms are a source of protection for
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
kids that may be that are in schools
 
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
it's not something kids be afraid of and
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
position of firearms should be fully
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
legal in this Camp you know campus uh
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
with another thought I don't know if you
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
heard about some of the news of teachers
 
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
doing adult content on school campuses
 
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
this is a deterrent for that kind of
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
behavior and also a source of help in
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
case there is some sort of dirty
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
Behavior going on in schools that's all
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
record William Rogers thank you
 
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
Winchester New Hampshire
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I'll tell the sponsor why I would
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
carry a gun in a safe school zone if I
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
was going for my grandson or my
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
granddaughter I'd want to protect them
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
because it's well documented that quote
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
unquote safe zones gun-free zones are
 
00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
targets for criminals because there's no
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
guns there and they can do what they
 
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.690 align:start position:0%
guns there and they can do what they
want

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
that is why I would carry a pistol to
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
pick up my granddaughter or my son or my
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
grandson or any of them that's why to me
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
a firearm is just a tool for protection
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's also a tool of enjoyment from
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
Marksmanship and hunting but in that
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
case it's for protection that is why I
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
oppose this Bill thank you for your time
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
now eight years later what have we done
 
00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
to reduce the risk of this kind of
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
school massacre
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
I say nothing
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
instead the legislature has voted to
 
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
prohibit enforcement of federal
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
Protections in the case of far arms
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
threats in New Hampshire schools
 
00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:29.059 align:start position:0%
our children are educated in fortnite
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
fortress-like structures
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
where children practice hiding from
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
with a continuation of school shootings
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
no wonder our children are experienced
 
00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
experiencing more angst and mental
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
HB 32 is one of many necessary steps to
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there are millions of
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
guns in this state
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
some of which can get into the hands
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
wrong hands and create Mayhem in our
 
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.150 align:start position:0%
wrong hands and create Mayhem in our
schools

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
HB 32 provides a modicum of protection
 
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
for our children
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
and may provide our children with
 
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.970 align:start position:0%
and may provide our children with
reassurance

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
reassurance
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
that we are looking out for them
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
HB 32 does not restrict anyone's guns
 
00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:24.230 align:start position:0%
HB 32 does not restrict anyone's guns
rights

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
or accept unschool premises where they
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
cannot possess a gun
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
I urgently urge you to vote
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
this time the chair calls
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and fine committee members I
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
am former representative John Burt I
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
served 12 years in this house and I'm
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
I would guess you would know I'm opposed
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
this bill is not needed
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
I've had dozens in dozens and dozens of
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
teachers call me when this bill was
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
before us when I was serving as a state
 
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.070 align:start position:0%
before us when I was serving as a state
representative

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
and they also oppose this bill because
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
bottom line we have teachers carrying in
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
this state
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has never had a school
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
shooting and there's a reason
 
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:51.500 align:start position:0%
because the nuts out there understand
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
that our teachers are carrying guns
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
also that the citizens are carrying guns
 
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:00.860 align:start position:0%
in our schools
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
so I hope that this bill will be itl
 
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman let me tell you about
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
Parkland Florida
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
there was a school shooting down there
 
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
pretty bad one
 
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman guess what it is today
 
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
it's not a gun free zone
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
they've earned the teachers because they
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
said they don't ever want to see what
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
happened that dark day
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
the teachers in Parkland Florida are
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
currently carrying guns
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
it is the only way to protect our
 
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.010 align:start position:0%
it is the only way to protect our
children

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
because as Parkland Florida in that
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
school in Texas showed us
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
the police do not have to go in and
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
protect the children
 
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059 align:start position:0%
they can hide outside
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
in beat up on the parents that are
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get in to protect their
 
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.029 align:start position:0%
trying to get in to protect their
children

00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand how anybody could
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
vote for this knowing those two schools
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
had police officers in Parkland Florida
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
the Texas Vivaldi Texas
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
they were pushing the parents back not
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
to go in there to protect their children
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has never had a school
 
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.730 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has never had a school
shooting

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
shooting
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
and I believe again is because our
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
teachers and our citizens carry guns in
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
our schools
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
we've never had a problem so I don't
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
know why this bill is needed
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
but as I said before Mr chairman on the
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
house floor as a state representative
 
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
that I served proudly for 12 years to
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
fight these bills
 
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
what I said
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
is if this bill passed
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
there will be a school shooting in New
 
00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:53.390 align:start position:0%
there will be a school shooting in New
Hampshire

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
and there'll be dead children and dead
 
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
teachers in the blood of those dead
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
children and dead teachers will be on
 
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
the hands of whoever votes for this
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
so I hope that every one of you
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
understands that we don't have a problem
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're one of the safest
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
states in the country
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to itl this and IPL it fast
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
this time the chair calls the honorable
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
and everyone in the public thank you for
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
taking the time in common and testify
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
on this Bill I'm here in support of this
 
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
bill let me tell you why
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a little bit
 
00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:08.270 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a little bit
background

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
I grow I grew up in El Salvador
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
before I move here
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
I used to hide and then in my bed
 
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
we used to go to school
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
with white towels anything why just to
 
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:25.460 align:start position:0%
try to protect our life
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
guns violence that was everywhere
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
when I was six years old and my sister
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
was seven years old
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
we went to our school
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
we find our principal our school
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
that was the worst traumatized thing
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
that I ever seen in my life
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
we find our body in blood everywhere on
 
00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:53.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
I don't wish any kid
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
to look through
 
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
what we went through
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
we don't need guns in the schools
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that guns in the school
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
is not going to make us eat safer
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
guns around school is going to make us
 
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.630 align:start position:0%
guns around school is going to make us
scared

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
scared
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
and for a lot of us who have been
 
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
traumatized for things like this is
 
00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:24.380 align:start position:0%
going to open scars
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to take away anyone's right
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
to have a gun
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
that's not what I wanted to do
 
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
but I just want a safer
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
in a bare environment for the children
 
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
and for everyone who have been through
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
the things that my sister and I went
 
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.330 align:start position:0%
the things that my sister and I went
through

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
I wish my sister was alive so she can be
 
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
here testified like myself but she's not
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
she passed away 13 years ago
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
all these cars and traumatized that she
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
went through
 
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
because the guy in violence
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
she passed away not the way that I wish
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that she did
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
but she started using drugs
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then she died from the HIV
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
but guy in violins it was a scar that
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
she she had all her life
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
until she passed away
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
so I asked the committee to support this
 
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.110 align:start position:0%
so I asked the committee to support this
bill

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
for people like myself and that she's no
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
longer here she doesn't have a voice
 
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.850 align:start position:0%
longer here she doesn't have a voice
anymore

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
and for many of us that we still walking
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative J.R
 
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:55.130 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative J.R
Hall

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee um
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
someone on the way up said it's
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to hear about who's running
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
the sound system so for those speaking
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
Yelling to the microphone I guess
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm here in opposition to this bill
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
um for multiple reasons one of which is
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
it will not address a criminal whose
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
intent on doing harm the end of the day
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
adding additional prohibitions on law
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
abiding citizens will only increase the
 
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.789 align:start position:0%
abiding citizens will only increase the
risk

00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
of an incident in New Hampshire schools
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
I think everybody in this room has a
 
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
common goal of making sure our children
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
are safe but this is the wrong way to go
 
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
first and foremost whether the
 
00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:36.419 align:start position:0%
instructor in the classroom wants this
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
role or not they are the only adult in
 
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
the room and if there's a problem they
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
will be because of proximity the only
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
the sorry the first responder to any
 
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.730 align:start position:0%
the sorry the first responder to any
incident

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
incident
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation several years ago
 
00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
outside of that outside of this Hall
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
was someone who was vehemently anti-gun
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
and we had a discussion about whether
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
teachers should be carrying mace
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
should be carrying pepper spray and the
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
reason we had that discussion and the
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
person agreed that was an appropriate
 
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
solution because they both we both
 
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.570 align:start position:0%
solution because they both we both
realized

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
realized
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
that the first responder in all
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
situations is the adult in the room when
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
you have children
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
this bill as filed will make our schools
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
more dangerous
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
or less safe depends how you want to say
 
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.090 align:start position:0%
or less safe depends how you want to say
it

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for it our schools are
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
safe there are there are faculty and
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
staff members who who do carry okay
 
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
there are people ready and willing to
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
respond who live adjacent to schools
 
00:27:50.529 --> 00:27:50.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:07.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
your work and
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
trying to uh enhance Public Safety in
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
our state
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is a bill to try to make
 
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
schools safe
 
00:28:29.049 --> 00:28:29.059 align:start position:0%
our teachers and our students and
 
00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:31.820 align:start position:0%
administrators and other people in
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
schools are really frightened and
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
anxious kids are anxious I'm a
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist we see this so often these
 
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
days and this is a bill to keep guns out
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
of schools so we don't have accidents
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
and we can begin to make our schools as
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
safe as they can be thank you very much
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to um voice my
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
opposition to this uh proposal
 
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:28.730 align:start position:0%
opposition to this uh proposal
um

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
I certainly understand the intent and I
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
think we all agree we want to make
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
schools safer
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
um I think our minds automatically go to
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
Columbine areas you know mass shootings
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think the
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
thing that I disagree with with this is
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
we are asking our abiding citizens to do
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
something not carry a gun in school
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
which we won't uh if this is passed but
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
if I was a criminal and I woke up in the
 
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:01.580 align:start position:0%
morning and decided that I was going to
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
inflict harm in a school
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
um I don't I would have no regard
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
um which for this so I really do not see
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
I understand the intent but I think the
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
I I do not feel as though this is if we
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
really ask ourselves if we pass this law
 
00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:24.470 align:start position:0%
really ask ourselves if we pass this law
today

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is it going to have a real
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
impact is this something
 
00:30:28.919 --> 00:30:30.769 align:start position:0%
impact is this something
that

00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
our children are going to be safer you
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
know when my son is in school is he less
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
likely uh to be In Harm's Way if this is
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
passed and I have to honestly say I
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
don't believe he will be safer I
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
actually genuinely feel he will be less
 
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
safe because I think in the instance of
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
people who are doing this type of
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
heinous crime they have no regard for
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.049 align:start position:0%
the law
and

00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
I know that
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
their mindset is they want to do
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
something go down in their last blaze of
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
glory and I think the immeasurable thing
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
with a firearm
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
ownership and and people having firearms
 
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
is you don't know who has a firearm and
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
if there's the thought it doesn't have
 
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
to be a firearm there but just the very
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
thought of there being a firearm is
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
enough to discourage somebody from going
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
in there because you're gonna you're
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
gonna mess up their master plan and and
 
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
they traditionally people have gone past
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
country zones uh like in Aurora Colorado
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
they went past two movie theaters to go
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
to the movie theater that had the no gun
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
sign over it
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
um in Amherst New Hampshire we had a gun
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
free zone probably 20 30 years ago with
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
his big Community got together and they
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
said we're a gun-free neighborhood they
 
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
started getting broken into left right
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
front center and when they took that
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
sign down the break-in stopped
 
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
um I won't belabor the point but
 
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
um I just don't I feel basically we
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
would be losing I would rather have
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
somebody uh trying to protect my child I
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
know there's always you know anytime
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
Farms involved in defense there's always
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
you know somebody could get hurt you
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
know that you don't intend to but I
 
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:18.059 align:start position:0%
would rather that than allow evil to
 
00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
name is Joe Hannon I'm the vice
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
president for gun owners of New
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm speaking in opposition
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
um this bill does one thing it makes
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
criminals out of people who are not
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
criminals law-abiding citizens uh
 
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
someone intent on harming someone or
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
committing a heinous crime is not going
 
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
to be deterred by a sign or a lesser
 
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
charge of a misdemeanor or even a class
 
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
B felony if someone is going to do that
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
they're going to do it
 
00:33:00.419 --> 00:33:01.850 align:start position:0%
they're going to do it
um

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot else to say other than
 
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
this is going to hurt people who could
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
possibly defend themselves in a
 
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
situation where their life may depend on
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
having a firearm with them uh years ago
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
when there was the shooting in
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I was actually in my son's
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
school teaching a few kids volunteering
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I went home saw the new I heard the
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
news there I went home uh the next week
 
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
I went back and they gave me a school
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
safety briefing on what to do if there's
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
a shooting
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
and since I didn't I wasn't an employee
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
I was a volunteer I didn't have a key to
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
the room to lock the door so they said I
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
couldn't lock the door but they covered
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
the windows and paper and told us to
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
just line all the kids up against the
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
wall so they can't see who's in the room
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
that was our self-defense plan
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
it was ridiculous for one there were
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
windows we could have easily gotten out
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
going to the woods but the bottom line
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
is we're making uh basically fishing a
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
barrel with this kind of policy and uh
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%

00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
the people that was uh there to help
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
with some of the policies and
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations there were a lot of
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations and this was not I
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
believe one of them
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%

sake of time I will pass on those

finally I want to share a quote from a
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
recent editorial that resonated with me
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
the latest shootings were tragically
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
inferiorly predictable
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
so let's ask politicians not just for
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
lower Flags in moving speeches
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
but also for a better way to honor the
 
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.109 align:start position:0%

Dead
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
an evidence-based slog that saves life
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the handout that I have for you the
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
testimony I've left you with three
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
references that I hope might be helpful
 
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099 align:start position:0%
for you as you deliberate your vote the
 
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
first is from the Rand Corporation it's
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
on the science of gun violence it's 486
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
pages but there's a fair amount of
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
information that might be relevant for
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%

it covers several bills I figured it was
 
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
were tree efficient and less burdensome
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
to you to have short comments on each
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
bill but there are obviously Bill
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
specific comments your testimony that
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
you're handing in is good for all the
 
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
bills but if you could limit your
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
testimony now to just a bill in front of
 
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.370 align:start position:0%
testimony now to just a bill in front of
us

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
I thought it was a little again more
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
efficient I want to
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hand this in if I may so
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
that the members can look at a table so
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
that the members can look at a table of
 
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.109 align:start position:0%
that the members can look at a table of
data

00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone else will present
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
on the third page of my testimony is a
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
table of data drawn from the FBI's
 
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
uniform crime reports
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
these data which cover 20 years from
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
2001 through 2020 show the incidence of
 
00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
violent crime per 100
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
a Time series this long and as I'll
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
point out so consistent likely is fairly
 
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
representative of reality
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes data series bounce around a
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
lot for example gains or losses in jobs
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
varies widely from month to month these
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
data annual are very consistent they
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
show that over this 20-year period the
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
incidence of violent crime in New
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with a one-year exception has
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
been a
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
among the three lowest incidences
 
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.829 align:start position:0%
among the three lowest incidences
Nationwide

00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
Nationwide
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
we live
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
in a very very safe state
 
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.069 align:start position:0%
in a very very safe state
second

00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at the line of data for
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it shows that the
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
incidence of violent crime in
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts throughout this 20-year
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
period has been at least twice that of
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
I point out for the benefit of those who
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
may not be familiar with Massachusetts
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
laws as to Firearms they are voluminous
 
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
I deem them nasty and repressive so over
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
20 years if gun control laws were
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
beneficial one would have thought
 
00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:57.260 align:start position:0%
that would be obvious in Massachusetts
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
because periodically they add to the
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
volume of their laws
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's brought down the level of violence
 
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
there but it's still twice that of New
 
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.990 align:start position:0%
there but it's still twice that of New
Hampshire

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:14.180 align:start position:0%
now to the specifics of
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
32 House Bill 32 FM
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
it is so vaguely drawn
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
that a purpose of it stated or not must
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
be twin snare those who are unaware
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
in a small town
 
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
a country school zone could cover the
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
entire town
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
so I have visions of towns being fenced
 
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.490 align:start position:0%
so I have visions of towns being fenced
off

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
as East Berlin was from West Berlin in
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
the bad old days you know you're leaving
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you are entering a
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
prohibited area
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
okay if we're gonna do that that gives a
 
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
person notice I I'm carrying I have to
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
do a U-turn and go around this town
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
the Practical impact of this is that
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
law-abiding folks who have no ill intent
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
are going to be ensnared
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know and I'm not asking now
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't be proper how many
 
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have actually
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
litigated against a state
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
I've done so twice
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
I hold in my hand
 
00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:25.579 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
temporary non-resident license to carry
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
firearms it was wrongfully revoked it
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
was restored to me by order of the
 
00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:36.740 align:start position:0%
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
that process took three and a half years
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
and even with me doing most of the law
 
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.370 align:start position:0%
and even with me doing most of the law
research

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
and drafting pleadings for my attorney's
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
review and signature cost about 125
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
the data in the fiscal note attached to
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
come from some other Galaxy
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's the only way I can describe them
 
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.050 align:start position:0%
it's the only way I can describe them
the

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
there's some imaginary rate that
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys are deemed to charge it
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't correspond to the facts so that
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
most folks charged under this bill
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
should you decide to enact it
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
are either going to be bankrupted or
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
they'll take a plea because they can't
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
afford to fight it
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
that kind of law should not be enacted
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
not only not here members of the
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
committee and Mr chairman shouldn't be
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
enacted anywhere it's a trap
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to cause folks to acquire
 
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
criminal records
 
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.730 align:start position:0%
criminal records
who

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
didn't have any criminal record
 
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
and the cause and the consequences of
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
that even if they fight it and even if
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
they succeed
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
could well be job loss
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
family problems because of the financial
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
spring and reputational damage
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
those who propound this kind of measure
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
may have Noble intent
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
the road to hell is paved with Noble
 
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.450 align:start position:0%
the road to hell is paved with Noble
intentions

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
intentions
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
in conclusion and I'll be happy to take
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have for me
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
please do not enact this bill or any
 
00:45:20.099 --> 00:45:25.010 align:start position:0%
please do not enact this bill or any
similar

states surrounding how to safely and
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
accurately shoot firearms this bill does
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to stop criminals from going on
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
to school grounds with Firearms nothing
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
it's already illegal to go on school

law
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
what this bill does do is stop
 
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizens from protecting
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%

intent undoing harm
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
it also makes women who have either left
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
abusive relationships or have stalkers
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%

or her stalker
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
will be further victimized by this
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
legislation if it were to pass
 
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
this legislation is written by an
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
out-of-state organization most of not
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
all these gun control bills are
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
and it seeks to solve a problem that
 
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist in New Hampshire
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
and again this bill will not stop
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
criminals from bringing Firearms onto
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
school grounds in fact criminals seek
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
out gun-free zones because they know
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
their victims will be unable to protect
 
00:47:06.839 --> 00:47:08.030 align:start position:0%
their victims will be unable to protect
themselves

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
please vote in expedient to legislate on
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
this bill all it does is make Granite
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
Staters especially women and children
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%

Daffy
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
thanks Jeff
 
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.730 align:start position:0%
thanks Jeff
um

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
this isn't the first time we've seen
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
this bill it's come up in various forms
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
in in years past most of you have heard
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
the same testimony over and over and
 
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.470 align:start position:0%
the same testimony over and over and
over

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
this bill won't accomplish anything the
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
only person that can defend you and keep
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
you safe and your families is you the
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's already
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
come to a decision years ago that the
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
police have no obligation to defend you
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
this is settled law
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
so the only person that can defend you
 
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:14.579 align:start position:0%
is you and so you're going to restrict
 
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
people's ability to defend themselves
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense I mean how many
 
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
states do we have to look at that
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
already restrict firearms in school
 
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
zones and other places which are
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
keep having school shootings time out
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
after Time After Time police can't
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
protect you the laws that you guys pass
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
can do nothing but punish people after
 
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
this bill will accomplish nothing but
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
period end of discussion it's proven in
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
Liberal state after liberal state if the
 
00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
if gun control work and keeping guns out
 
00:48:58.329 --> 00:48:58.339 align:start position:0%
of people's hands then
 
00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
Chicago New York you know name a city
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
would be like the safest places in the
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
world but instead they're the most
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous because nobody can defend
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
themselves from bad people
 
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:11.579 align:start position:0%
so what are we going to accomplish by
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
doing this nothing the structure of the
 
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
bill is terrible we've beat this to
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
death and what disturbs me most is that
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of the bill keep hearing
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
the same stuff over and over and we keep
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
looking at the same bad results in
 
00:49:28.609 --> 00:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
states that have enacted stuff like this
 
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
and yet year after year after a year we
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
get the same dumb idea presented to us
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry to be offensive but that's
 
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
a fact I want results I don't want fluff
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
and this won't accomplish anything
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
any questions oh one other point
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
this bill in its structure doesn't
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
accommodate what if you have a situation
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
where a parent is walking a child to
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
school there's no accommodation for that
 
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
person to to carry a firearm and take
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
care of it it's one thing if you have a
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
car but not everybody drives there are
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
lots of people that walk their kids to
 
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
school so the structure of this bill is
 
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
terrible the ideas behind it don't
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish anything and it's only going
 
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
to make us less safe
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony have a good
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
day thank you
 
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:50:49.849 --> 00:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
my name is Nancy Brennan I'm from where
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for being here and for
 
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
this long day ahead of you
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
I find it
 
00:50:58.319 --> 00:51:00.290 align:start position:0%
I find it
ironic

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
ironic
 
00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:03.059 align:start position:0%
and more than a little sad
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
that in these weeks that we are
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
discussing this bill there are other
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
bills being discussed
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
that would supposedly
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
keep our kids safe by not letting them
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
read certain books or
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
keep our kids safe by not letting them
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
use the bathroom
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
and yet this
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
bill that deals with deadly consequences
 
00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:42.980 align:start position:0%
should have full support
 
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
will this bill by itself save all our
 
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
children and will it make sure that we
 
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
never have a school shooting no it will
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
not but this bill along with some other
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
very good legislation such as a piece I
 
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
heard I think yesterday on Health Care
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Care for Kids along with
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
some of the other bills you're going to
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
hear today would go a long way in making
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
a huge difference
 
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
I grew up at a time when the hunters
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
brought their guns you could see them in
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
the back of the trucks because it was
 
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
hunting season and I'm not even sure
 
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
they locked their trucks the world is
 
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
very different if you doubt it go back
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
and look at the speech last night and
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
the angry partisan way we treated each
 
00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
other it is not the same world and we
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
need to do something this is one little
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
piece I am a teacher no longer but once
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
a teacher always a teacher and with all
 
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
due respect to my former representative
 
00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
who said he had talked to dozens and
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
dozens of teachers who want to carry
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
guns I too have talked to dozens and
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
dozens of teachers here in New Hampshire
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
and across this country when I was lucky
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
enough to be a new Hampshire's teacher
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
of the year and travel and meet with
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
other teachers and everyone I talked to
 
00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
agreed we are busy trying to teach the
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
kids to read and write
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
we do not want to carry guns in our
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
classrooms I believe in the Second
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment I actually own a gun and I'm a
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
pretty good shot but I would never have
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
a gun in my classroom and if you think
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
it would make a difference
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you are terribly terribly
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
wrong there was a there was a story or a
 
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
person who was interviewed when uh Gabby
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
givers was shot and he was a person a
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
civilian that was allowed to carry a gun
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
and he was there and he heard the
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
gunshots and he said by the time I got
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
my gun out and tried to figure out who
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
was shooting who and who I should
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
protect it was over
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
if you've ever taught middle school
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what it feels like
 
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes in a middle school classroom I
 
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
would urge you pass this bill pass these
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
mental health bills and let's begin to
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
change the narrative there is a poem
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
called America is a gun a lot of you may
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
have heard it but it talks about every
 
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
country what are they known for wine
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
cheese this that and every verse ends
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
with America is a gun let's change the
 
00:54:59.809 --> 00:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
narrative Let's Make a Difference thank
 
00:54:59.819 --> 00:55:02.809 align:start position:0%
narrative Let's Make a Difference thank
you

00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%

I just want to read briefly from the New
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%

00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
guns are not the answer to the world's
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
problems and I don't think anyone here
 
00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
no matter what side Iran believes that
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
however there are well-documented
 
00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:00.410 align:start position:0%
however there are well-documented
instances

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
whereas firearm stops
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
another bad person ill intent who has a
 
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
firearm or a knife
 
00:56:10.569 --> 00:56:10.579 align:start position:0%
these had happened in churches
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
Walmarts and even schools
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes as a school resource officer
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
that would stop the assailant
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
now to the best of my recollection we
 
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
have not had a school shooting in New
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank God Almighty
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
but criminals don't like challenges
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll draw my law enforcement and
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
Military experience to guarantee you
 
00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:35.210 align:start position:0%
Military experience to guarantee you
that

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's why they give up when uniforms
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
show up
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
as it was pointed out earlier
 
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
officers do not have
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
a duty to protect you or your family
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
Society in general
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
I love our law enforcement and 98 of
 
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.010 align:start position:0%
I love our law enforcement and 98 of
them

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
will step in front of you on me and take
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
a bullet in defense of us
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
some woman
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
as evidenced
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
and selling the school shootings that
 
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
we've seen documented videos
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
they sit there and wait
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
and that's unfortunate
 
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
does that mean because I'm carrying a
 
00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:17.579 align:start position:0%
firearm in school legally
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to be a hero no
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
does it mean it gives the kids and
 
00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:24.059 align:start position:0%
teachers and people in that school
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
fighting chance if I choose to engage
 
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
that bad person
 
00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:28.849 align:start position:0%
that bad person
yeah

00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
maybe I draw enough fire maybe I get
 
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.569 align:start position:0%
maybe I draw enough fire maybe I get
killed

00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
killed
 
00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
maybe it gives the kids a chance to get
 
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.170 align:start position:0%
maybe it gives the kids a chance to get
out

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
maybe I go down
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
maybe I stopped them
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
I believe isn't as well intentioned we
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
want safe schools I do believe that I
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone here is doing
 
00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.270 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone here is doing
anything

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
out of spite
 
00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579 align:start position:0%
although not what they feel pure in
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
their High
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
but there is a reality here that evil
 
00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:58.130 align:start position:0%
but there is a reality here that evil
exists

00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
it does
 
00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
some people just want to see the world
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
there's many good people here today
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
who have a belief different than mine
 
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
that the firearming school would save
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
the lives of students and teachers and I
 
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
respect that
 
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.609 align:start position:0%
respect that
but

00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
I'll bet yeah khalafi from Aroma Joe's
 
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
if I was at their child's school and I
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
took action
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
whether I fall
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
or whether I make it
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
that they'd be happy someone did
 
00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:33.589 align:start position:0%
that they'd be happy someone did
something

00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
they gave those kids and those teachers
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
we can look back
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
to the 50s and 60s when they were
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
shooting teams in schools
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have the problems we have
 
00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:46.789 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have the problems we have
now

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
we need to fix that
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
mental health is a big deal
 
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.230 align:start position:0%
mental health is a big deal

we are probably very well known in this
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
room to many of you we believe in
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
responsible gun ownership and support
 
01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:52.819 align:start position:0%
gun owners rights but there are several
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
instances where we need to have laws and
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines to protect our children and
 
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
to protect our society there are many
 
01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:05.579 align:start position:0%
many bills for lots of things this is
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
only one of many bills it can't just be
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
this one that protects the kids or
 
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
protects our citizens I am reading
 
01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:18.059 align:start position:0%
testimony on behalf of my dear friend
 
01:02:22.809 --> 01:02:22.819 align:start position:0%
Gene lute she is a school board member
 
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:26.180 align:start position:0%
in the town of Amherst
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
restoring gun-free school zones to our
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
state is something that I feel
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
passionate about my experience as a
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
school board member of the Souhegan High
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
School in Amherst for 13 years was
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
especially embolding because as you know
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
school board members are entrusted with
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
maintaining a safe learning environment
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
for the children and their dis in their
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
districts in addition to being a board
 
01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
member I was also on multiple security
 
01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
study committees over the years
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
after a year-long study recommendations
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
were made for how to improve Security in
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
our schools and I'm going to take a
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
moment and just mention that after many
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
many years so Eagan finally got a buzz
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
in uh door at the front
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
for many years you could just walk
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
straight into the front
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
so that's a and also an important factor
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the state legislature
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
legislators decision several years ago
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
to allow people to carry guns into
 
01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:35.420 align:start position:0%
schools make safety in almost
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
insurmountable challenge we would have
 
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
to create a prison-like environment for
 
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
our children in order to ensure that bad
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
people with guns never entered our
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
schools this bill to restrict the
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
possession of dis or discharge of a
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
firearm in a safe school zone would go a
 
01:03:55.329 --> 01:03:55.339 align:start position:0%
long way toward protecting our children
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
and School staff parents need to feel
 
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
confident that they are sending their
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
children to a safe place every day
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
a federal law on gun-free school zones
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
is adhered to in a majority of the
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
states in this country
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
I believe that we are one of three
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
exceptions I do hope that this committee
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
will back HB 32 and its Common Sense
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
approach to protecting our public school
 
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
students and staff from gun violence
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%

legislators
 
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
um my name is Kang Liu speaking to Mike
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Kang Liu I'm a New Hampshire
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
right residing in Cheshire County
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to say that just ask a few
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
questions isn't it true that the
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation would not apply to
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers carrying
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
firearms in schools loans during the
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
performance of their duties of course
 
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
it's true doesn't apply to police
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
officers and isn't it true that these
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
police officers derive their power from
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
our constitution to protect us and to
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
serve us
 
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
specifically article 8 of our
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
constitution says all power residing
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
originally in and being derived from the
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
people all the magistrates and officers
 
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
of government are our substitutes and
 
01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.370 align:start position:0%
of government are our substitutes and
agents

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
agents
 
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
because those statements are true
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
then the intent and effect of this bill
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional on its face since it
 
01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
would deprive the people of our original
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
right and power to defend ourselves and
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
our children
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
we're still
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
and even more intolerable is that the
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill are working to
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
deprive us of these rights knowing full
 
01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:40.970 align:start position:0%
deprive us of these rights knowing full
well

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court has concluded
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
that as a matter of General law the
 
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
state does not have an affirmative
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect an individual
 
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
against private violence see the Cheney
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
versus Winnebago 1989.
 
01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
this is a government of delegated powers
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme within its prescribed sphere
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
but powerless outside of it in this
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
country sovereignty resides in the
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
people and Congress and legislatures can
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
exercise no power which they have not by
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
their constitution entrusted to it all
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
else is withheld if the power is not in
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
terms granted it does not exist see
 
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:26.660 align:start position:0%
Juilliard versus Greenman
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
1884 a Supreme Court decision thus I
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
conclude that for facial violations of
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
Article 2 and article 8 of our New
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution the Second
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment and article 4 section 4 of the
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution this bill must fail
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time

we support this bill the Federal Gun
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
free schools act prohibits students from
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
bringing Firearms into schools and the
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
gun free school zone act prohibits all
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
other persons from bringing Firearms
 
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
within one thousand feet of school
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
property unless they are licensed by the
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
state to carry a firearm while federal
 
01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:34.259 align:start position:0%
law establishes gun free school zones
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
with qualifications gaps in state law
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
and statements from the Attorney
 
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
General's office has left school
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
districts and police departments in
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
murky water on enforcement and
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes safe spaces for our children
 
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
to learn and grow
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
this is further Complicated by House
 
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
Bill 1178 which Governor sununu signed
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
into law last summer this seeks to
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
prevent local and state law enforcement
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
and school officials from Akron swiftly
 
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
in response to the presence of firearms
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
in our K-12 schools
 
01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
a bill this afternoon seeks to further
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
penalize state and local law enforcement
 
01:09:09.169 --> 01:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
and others for taking quick action to
 
01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
prevent gun violence
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
federal state laws ensuring that schools
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
are gun free and zones have helped make
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
K-12 schools even safer significantly

the claim that gun-free zones invite
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
mass shootings has been thoroughly
 
01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
debunked by research showing that the

overwhelming majority nearly 90 percent

this bill seeks to clarify that our

elementary middle and high schools are
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
gun free it is critical that this

Hampshire right now local school
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
districts and police departments face
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
real challenges in how to appropriately
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
deal with it in light of the major gaps
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
in state law
 
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of States 47 of them
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
and the District of Columbia prohibit

New Hampshire and Wyoming do not
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
this problem will only go worse as time
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
passes and especially now that more
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
people realize how loose the gun laws
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
are in New Hampshire in fact in the past
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
some gun groups have even hosted
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
seminars encouraging people to carry
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
firearms in our schools
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
this includes our classrooms Elementary
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%

games you name it
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
right now someone could bring a gun into
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
a school and unless they issue threats
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
or start shooting students
 
01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
school and local law enforcement are
 
01:11:24.189 --> 01:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
essentially being told to stand down
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
in fact some have been told to contact a
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
regional ETF agent instead of taking
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
immediate action
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
this means that schools are forced to
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
monitor the situation directing School
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
personnel and resources away from the
 
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
primary job of teaching our children
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
if the person carrying the gun does
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
indeed do harm and start shooting there
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
will be a lot of second guessing as to
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
what should have been done from the
 
01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:50.630 align:start position:0%
what should have been done from the
start

01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
this is the major liability in public
 
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
relations crisis for our schools at best
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
and we all know what a worst case
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
scenario means
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
let's get the second guessing and
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
Empower our local school districts and
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
police departments to take action from
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
the start without this bill they won't
 
01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
have all the options they can rely on to
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
help deter a dangerous situation before
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
it becomes a deadly one guns do not
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
belong in our schools

01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what reasonable distance is
 
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
but I guess this is it my name is Penny
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
Dean I'm from Concord I'm a private

have one time to make a good first
 
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.310 align:start position:0%
have one time to make a good first
impression

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
impression
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I would ask that you itl this bill
 
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
we can start from the beginning where
 
01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
it's a train wreck whoever wrote it
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
didn't bother to proofread or even look
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
at what they were saying because if you
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
look at page one line five they
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
reference RSA 189 13A Roman 5.
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
and it says specifically specifically
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
and if the offenses enumerated in that
 
01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
statute well that statute is actually a
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
provision about checking the criminal
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
records for volunteers
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
so my basic premise is when you start
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
going through this and you look at it
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
it's gobbledygook that doesn't make
 
01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
it's gobbledygook that doesn't make
sense

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
because I look at things like a mechanic
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
how do you actually do these things this
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
you had one speaker say this bill would
 
01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
go a long way and I agree it would go a
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
really long way and make a difference a
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
bad difference
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at Death By A Thousand
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
Cuts when it comes to people who hate
 
01:14:51.649 --> 01:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
guns they don't think guns belong
 
01:14:51.659 --> 01:14:52.729 align:start position:0%
guns they don't think guns belong
anywhere

01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
and they don't like people that carry
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
guns and they always want a reason that
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't have guns
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
when you look at this bill
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
and again we'd look back at practicality
 
01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
even if you wanted to enforce this bill
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
if you look at page one line 19.
 
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
they talk about the grounds of a school
 
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.510 align:start position:0%
they talk about the grounds of a school
zone

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
zone
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
idify any of you including the
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
facilities manager for Concord schools
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
to show me the property lines of all the
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
conquered property in the school's use
 
01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
I bet they can't I know they can't I can
 
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
tell you that my property my back
 
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
property backs up with the crystal
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
McCullough School
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
and they had some trees years ago that
 
01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
grew over my property and so I was
 
01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
willing to pay for tree cutters because
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
I wanted the branches fun
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
it took me hours and hours and days and
 
01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:45.020 align:start position:0%
days to get to the facilities manager
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
who gave me permission he said hey if
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
you're paying bring in your people and
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
cut away but the gist of it is how are
 
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
we going to find out who's in charge to
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
get permission to do these things this
 
01:15:59.330 --> 01:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
was talking about a tree cutting a
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
couple branches from a tree and you're
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
asking for permission to carry guns
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
through there for shooting
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
for hunting for whatever hunting season
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
will be over five years from now before
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
you get to the right person and then you
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
ask for those who are politically
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
what I call incorrect they're going to
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
say well why can't they walk around this
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
way why do they got to walk over the
 
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
school property with our gun and what
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
gun are they going to carry and when are
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
they going to be there no no no no no no
 
01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
they going to be there no no no no no no
no

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter if this passes
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
there won't be any people walking across
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
the back of school property
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
but more importantly you're going to
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
have people getting arrested this is one
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
of these bills I call it make Work bill
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
for lawyers
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
and I already got plenty of work I don't
 
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
need more work I'm very grateful for
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
that but what you're talking about here
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
is innocent people getting ensnared not
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
knowing where the boundaries are
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
and I guess we talk about people
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
carrying firearms in school zones
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
what's the problem we haven't had a
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire in decades with
 
01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
this Pro with those issues so just
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
because someone doesn't like Firearms
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
just because someone's carrying a
 
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
firearm doesn't mean they're going to do
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
anything illegal and they talk about
 
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
monitoring the situation why are you
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
monitoring any situation they're not
 
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
bothering anybody you need to leave them
 
01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:24.290 align:start position:0%
bothering anybody you need to leave them
alone

01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing when you go to page two
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
and again we go back to look but paid um
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
lines 19 20 21 22.
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
we go back to about authorized by school
 
01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.110 align:start position:0%
we go back to about authorized by school
authorities

01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
this facilities manager does that mean
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
the principal of the school where it's
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
located does that mean the school
 
01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.189 align:start position:0%
located does that mean the school
superintendent

01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
who does that mean so even again if I
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
thought I were ever so lucky to get the
 
01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
permission of any one of these any more
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
anti-gun people do you honestly think
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
you know and then we get this what I
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
call Turf War the principle gives me
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
permission and the school's
 
01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
superintendent says he wasn't authorized
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
to give you that permission
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you're looking to set people up to
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
fail you're looking to set up innocent
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
gun owners to fail but the bottom
 
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
substantive thing that you should ask
 
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
yourself beyond the horrible mechanics
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
of this someone who drafted this was not
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
a litigator or lawyer I can tell you
 
01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.270 align:start position:0%
a litigator or lawyer I can tell you
that

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
is that do we need this the answer is we
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely don't need it and it's
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
abysmal and it's really offensive to the
 
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.350 align:start position:0%
abysmal and it's really offensive to the
Constitution

01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's really offensive you look at people
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
like this and you say what are you
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do here we've had enough
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
instances in this country going back
 
01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
that when people have had firearms in
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
school zones lawful people they've been
 
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
able to stop things they've been able to
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
stop Carnage so I respectfully say that
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
this bill is a horrible piece of
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
grafting a horrible piece of legislation
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
it's not mechanically sound or legally
 
01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:03.950 align:start position:0%
it's not mechanically sound or legally
sound

01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
sound
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
and it will result in a lot of
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
litigation but more importantly is we
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
have constitutional rights and they
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
Trump all of this Balderdash of what
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
people don't like maybe people feel
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable if I wear pink do I not
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
have to wear blue
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
you know so I really am happy to answer
 
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
mechanical questions but again this is a
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
does anyone else who has not turned in a
 
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
they're being run I hereby close the
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%

on HP 32 the committee will take a
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:15.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%

foreign

01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%

foreign
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to resume hearings if
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
everyone could please take their seats
 
01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:10.620 align:start position:0%

at this point I am opening to public
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%

01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:24.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:25.729 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
[Music]

01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
ing to everyone
 
01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.070 align:start position:0%
ing to everyone
um

01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
guns don't kill people
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
people do
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
now that's an expression that's been
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
used for many many years I'm not sure I
 
01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
ever got my mind around it
 
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.850 align:start position:0%
ever got my mind around it
um

01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
and yet I've come to recognize the truth
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:55.460 align:start position:0%
that guns don't
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
automatically kill people it's the
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
people who aim those guns
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
and that's why I believe that this bill
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
is so incredibly important that is
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
supported by more than 90 percent of our
 
01:32:17.219 --> 01:32:19.330 align:start position:0%
supported by more than 90 percent of our
constituents

01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:19.340 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:22.820 align:start position:0%
and by 90
 
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
of gun owners that is responsible gun
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
owners and by Republicans
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
slightly higher percentage of Democrats
 
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
support it but when you're up at 90
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's in the stratosphere
 
01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
so I think it's pretty clear that this
 
01:32:47.169 --> 01:32:47.179 align:start position:0%
is a bill that is supported by people
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
who want to protect the right of
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
responsible people to own guns
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses to knock the gun but
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
the person who wants to use the gun
 
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on guns but I do know
 
01:33:10.129 --> 01:33:10.139 align:start position:0%
a fair amount about people
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
most of them including gun owners
 
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
care about gun safety
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is to protect us from those
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
very few
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
who purchase and misuse guns for reasons
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
that no responsible gun owner or caring
 
01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
citizen would support to harm others and
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps in some cases to harm themselves
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
never having purchased a gun I was
 
01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
interested to learn how easy it would be
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
to purchase a gun legally do you know
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
that there are 59
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
000 unique gun dealers licensed gun
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
dealers across the country that's four
 
01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:01.820 align:start position:0%
times as many as there are McDonald's
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
and nearly twice as many as U.S post
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
Offices nobody lives more than 10 miles
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
from a licensed gun dealer you don't
 
01:34:18.050 --> 01:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
have to travel far
 
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
to be able to legally buy a gun and
 
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
legally participate in a background
 
01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:26.810 align:start position:0%
legally participate in a background
check

01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
this bill requires commercial Firearms
 
01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
sales in New Hampshire
 
01:34:38.050 --> 01:34:38.060 align:start position:0%
to be processed through a licensed
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
Firearms dealer the bull does close what
 
01:34:46.129 --> 01:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
is referred to as the Charleston
 
01:34:46.139 --> 01:34:48.550 align:start position:0%
is referred to as the Charleston
loophole

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
01:34:55.729 --> 01:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
referring to what happened in Charleston
 
01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
before one of the most egregious
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
massacres and that is someone who would
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
not have passed the background check
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
was permitted to have a gun because it
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
took more than three days
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
for the report to come back
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
this bill provides
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
a way to wait until that report comes
 
01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.030 align:start position:0%
a way to wait until that report comes
back

01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:28.820 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's that's important
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
also you will see that I've submitted an
 
01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.070 align:start position:0%
also you will see that I've submitted an
amendment

01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
when the bill was present was printed
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
the analysis said
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
this bill excludes private
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
non-commercial sales or transfers
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
between individuals provided neither
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
individual is prohibited from owning or
 
01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
possessing a firearm under state or
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
somehow when the bill was printed
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
the analysis was there but that specific
 
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
language was omitted from the bill and
 
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
so I have submitted the amendment that
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
adds those uh important words and I
 
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
believe it's been distributed to the
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
entire Committee in a recent
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with one of our
 
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
colleagues he talked about the fact that
 
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
he wanted to be able to give a gun to
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
his child
 
01:36:36.610 --> 01:36:36.620 align:start position:0%
he has trained the child
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
in gun safety and he felt that the child
 
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
was of an age where he would be
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
responsible he would be able to do that
 
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
in the language in this bill
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
um our distinguished former colleague
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
Catherine Rogers brought expertise
 
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
in her repeated efforts to have a
 
01:37:06.189 --> 01:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
background check bill become law
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
there will be highly knowledgeable
 
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
Witnesses who will follow me and be
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
better able to answer almost all
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
questions but I am here not as a gun
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
owner not as an opponent of gun
 
01:37:26.290 --> 01:37:26.300 align:start position:0%
ownership but representing the
 
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
overwhelming percentage of New Hampshire
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
citizens including almost all gun owners
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
who believe in responsible gun ownership
 
01:37:42.169 --> 01:37:42.179 align:start position:0%
background checks makes sense they use
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
existing systems that are familiar to
 
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
Legal gun purchases and they save lives
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
I hope this will be the year that this
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee will support
 
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
a carefully drawn background check bill
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:09.770 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
morning

01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Dr johannan and I'm
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to start telling you who's on Deck
 
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
just so we can move it along after that
 
01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
that idea courtesy of the
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
sergeant-at-arms thank you wherever you
 
01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.250 align:start position:0%
sergeant-at-arms thank you wherever you
are

01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
good morning again my name is Joe Hannon
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
Gunners of New Hampshire vice president
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
I'm in opposition to this bill as usual
 
01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.209 align:start position:0%
I'm in opposition to this bill as usual
um

01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
for start I mean for starters I'd like
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
to just say that this bill the main
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
issue is the definition of commercial
 
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.070 align:start position:0%
issue is the definition of commercial
sale

01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
sale
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
um now I haven't read the amendment
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's proposed so I'll just speak to
 
01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:51.020 align:start position:0%
the bill at hand but commercial sales
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
transfer of ownership of a firearm
 
01:38:54.649 --> 01:38:54.659 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to a sale gift
 
01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
or exchange
 
01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh that's not the definition of a
 
01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
commercial sale anywhere else uh you
 
01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
know Commerce involves selling for
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
profit livelihood uh even the federal
 
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
definition of of Commerce and related to
 
01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
Firearms has nothing to do with
 
01:39:12.169 --> 01:39:12.179 align:start position:0%
individual trade or gifting to a spouse
 
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
or family members things like that or
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
even individual Private Sales which are
 
01:39:18.050 --> 01:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
legal at the federal level someone has
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
to engage in the
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
business of selling Firearms so if
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
someone is just liquidating their
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
collection or selling a few Firearms or
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
not making a profit and let me tell you
 
01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:28.139 align:start position:0%
that if you're selling a used firearm
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's generally not profitable
 
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
um so it doesn't meet the definition of
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
Commerce it's almost I don't want to go
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
to the length level of saying it's news
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
new speak but it's definitely changing
 
01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
the definition of a word to make people
 
01:39:42.169 --> 01:39:42.179 align:start position:0%
think differently about not just this
 
01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
bill but
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
everything that we're going to be
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
governed by do we want to change the
 
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
definition of Commerce not just for this
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
but for everything anything can be
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
commercial commercial trade if this is
 
01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:53.629 align:start position:0%
commercial commercial trade if this is
allowed

01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:39:53.639 --> 01:39:58.189 align:start position:0%
allowed
um

01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
let's see um
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
there's another problem I'm not really
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
sure if it's
 
01:40:03.239 --> 01:40:04.310 align:start position:0%
sure if it's
um

01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to be addressed but it
 
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:06.770 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to be addressed but it
says

01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
when someone has to sell they have to go
 
01:40:10.209 --> 01:40:10.219 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:40:13.010 --> 01:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
licensed dealer and
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
the seller is allowed to give them the
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
firearm the background check will be
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
performed on the buyer
 
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
and the show process the sale as if they
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
were the seller so now the dealer is a
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
temporary seller they're acting as if
 
01:40:29.689 --> 01:40:29.699 align:start position:0%
they're the seller at that point
 
01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh the person who originally dropped the
 
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
gun off is allowed to remove the firearm
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
from business premises from the license
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
dealer while the background check for
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
the purchaser is being conducted so if
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for it to to be
 
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
conducted they can remove it and take it
 
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
home do whatever they want with it
 
01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
but when the background check for the
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
seller the purchaser is completed they
 
01:40:49.729 --> 01:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
must return to complete the transaction
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
if it's illegally allowed to present go
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
forward but if not it must be returned
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
to the original seller however there's
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
nothing that says that they can give it
 
01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
back to the seller without having to do
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
another background check now it makes
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
sense I think most people would think
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's what would happen but it says
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
if the dealer cannot legally deliver the
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
firearm to the buyer the dealer shall
 
01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
return the firearm to the seller after
 
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
ensuring compliance while state and
 
01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
federal laws applicable to the transfer
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the transfer to the buyers shall not
 
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
take place well according to the first
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
definition of commercial firearm the
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
commercial sales that's any transfer of
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
ownership the ownership went to the
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
dealer and they have to act as if
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
they're the seller and now you've got to
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
do another background check to get your
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
own firearm back from the dealer
 
01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
so that is one one issue
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
um another thing is this is an indirect
 
01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
tax on gun owners in a sense you know
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
people with without a significant means
 
01:41:42.649 --> 01:41:42.659 align:start position:0%
you know 25 or 50 for a background check
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
processing fee can be quite significant
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh so this disproportionately affects
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
people that don't have the means uh to
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
easily throw away 25 or 50 for every
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
transaction on a firearm
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh it's we know we've heard it's
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
federally illegal to sell a firearm to a
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
felon and other categories of
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
individuals who are not allowed to
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
possess a firearm this bill does nothing
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
um anything to prevent legal law-abiding
 
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
gun owners from getting a firearm what
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
it does is it increases the value of the
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
black market you've now made the black
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
market more lucrative and I ask you not
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
to do that and please I tell this bill
 
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
the chair calls representative John Burr
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
and next up will be Timothy wolf
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and fine committee
 
01:42:34.250 --> 01:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
members again I am former representative
 
01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
John Burt
 
01:42:38.689 --> 01:42:38.699 align:start position:0%
I represented uh Goffstown wear and dear
 
01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman House Bill 59 seeks to
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
categorize all sales as commercial
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
but a gift or a loan between friends
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
family neighbors is not a commercial
 
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
sale it is a private transaction that
 
01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
should stay private the government has
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
no business telling people how to or
 
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
when to dispose of personal property Mr
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I am against this bill we have
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
seen this bill many many times we kill
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
it every time
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's not needed the federal government
 
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
already does background checks
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
it works
 
01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
and I like how they delete the records
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
of my records within 24 hours
 
01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
now from what I understand that they
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
will make a database here in New
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but there is an RSA that they
 
01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
have to follow also to delete it but why
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
have two databases I don't think we need
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
two databases on what guns I buy
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you and please oppose this thank
 
01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:46.250 align:start position:0%
thank you and please oppose this thank
you

01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
calls Mr Timothy wolf and up next will
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
be James Caffrey
 
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:56.629 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little bit uh just to stay
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
simply a little confused by the language
 
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
on the bill and not really sure of its
 
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh necessity given the laws that we
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
already have
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
um that you know first of all when you
 
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
purchase a firearm they mentioned
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
commercial firearm transactions so I
 
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
assume that means anything through a
 
01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:19.250 align:start position:0%
assume that means anything through a
dealer

01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
dealer
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't know of any dealer in the
 
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
state that you can go to and not do a
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
background check if they're doing things
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
as they should which everyone that I
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
know does
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
um my understanding I might be enough
 
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
dealers here probably could correct me
 
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but if you're buying a
 
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
pistol it generally goes to the federal
 
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
government and they do it FBI does a
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
national incident you know the
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
background checked on you and uh if it's
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
um you know the uh or I'm not sure if
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's the other way around and the other
 
01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
one goes to the state police but you're
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
going to go through the background check
 
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
um so I don't really see if we're
 
01:44:54.649 --> 01:44:54.659 align:start position:0%
already doing this already I'm not
 
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
really understanding the need for this
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
at all because I feel like it's already
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
being done
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
um why would we use more of our state's
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
resources for something that's our we're
 
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
already doing
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't make any sense
 
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is just in the
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of this
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
um under the analysis it says the bill
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
excludes private non-commercial sales
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
or transfers between individuals
 
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
provided neither individual is
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
prohibited from owning or possessing a
 
01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
firearm under state or federal law
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
so it's saying that it excludes
 
01:45:26.159 --> 01:45:28.609 align:start position:0%
so it's saying that it excludes
individuals

01:45:28.609 --> 01:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:45:28.619 --> 01:45:29.570 align:start position:0%
individuals
um

01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
and then further down
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
under the purpose
 
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh it talks about the the commercial
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
firearm sales
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
um and then a little further down it the
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
background under the definitions
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
actually where I got confused it talks
 
01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:46.310 align:start position:0%
actually where I got confused it talks
about

01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
um the commercial sale uh is not limited
 
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
to uh sale exchange or gift
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
um so if you're if you're gifting it to
 
01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.729 align:start position:0%
um so if you're if you're gifting it to
somebody

01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
how is that
 
01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:02.330 align:start position:0%
how is that
um

01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:05.209 --> 01:46:05.219 align:start position:0%
I I just I don't understand the language
 
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
for commercial here
 
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
um you know because they actually have
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
an individual listed under definitions
 
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.219 align:start position:0%
means a natural person so is there a
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
conflict between the exclusion under
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
analysis and
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the definitions uh they they seem
 
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
seem I I might be missing something here
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
but it seems like there's a conflict in
 
01:46:28.609 --> 01:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
in the in the in in the definitions and
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
the exclusion under the analysis
 
01:46:31.139 --> 01:46:31.970 align:start position:0%
the exclusion under the analysis
um

01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
other than that um
 
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
that's all I have thank you thank you
 
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
for your testimony chair calls
 
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
um James gaffery
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
and up next will be je simpkin sorry for
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
my handwriting the last name's Gaffney
 
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:54.890 align:start position:0%
my handwriting the last name's Gaffney
um

01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
is poorly written we've dealt with the
 
01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
same language or intent multiple times
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
has been voted down each time
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to be a little more
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
special than previous versions and that
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
it attempts to tell me that the sky is
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
green and the grass is blue
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
in stating that a private transaction
 
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
between two individuals is somehow a
 
01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.169 align:start position:0%
between two individuals is somehow a
commercial

01:47:26.169 --> 01:47:26.179 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
activity are we then going to to apply
 
01:47:33.290 --> 01:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
that same standard to every transaction
 
01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
whether it's it pertains to a firearm or
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
any other inanimate object no of course
 
01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
we're not so why would we do it in this
 
01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
special occasion
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
murders illegal
 
01:47:51.169 --> 01:47:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
we have innumerable laws to to that say
 
01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
various things are illegal and so now
 
01:47:59.810 --> 01:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
we're going to criminalize
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
a the transaction of some inanimate
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
object it's not going to accomplish
 
01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:06.410 align:start position:0%
object it's not going to accomplish
anything

01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
all it does is make more work for people
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
it makes more it more difficult for two
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
individuals to to perform a transaction
 
01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh there should be a cost analysis of
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
this right first and foremost what is it
 
01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
going to add to the the burden of two
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
individuals to to engage in a
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
transaction a private transaction
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
what about all the trips back and forth
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
between the FFL between these two people
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
should there also be an environmental
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
impact study
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be ridiculous I'm
 
01:48:44.169 --> 01:48:44.179 align:start position:0%
trying to to point out the obvious
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
problems with this bill and the fact
 
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to accomplish
 
01:48:49.739 --> 01:48:52.010 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to accomplish
anything

01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
calls je simpkin and up next will be
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman of members of
 
01:49:09.770 --> 01:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for giving me an
 
01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify I make it my
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
mission to put before you things that
 
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
probably you would not otherwise hear
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
so some disclosures I'm federally
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
licensed Firearms dealer I've been so
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
for a few months short of 40 years 30 of
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
them in New Hampshire
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
I personally do background checks
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
that is to say I'm the fellow who picks
 
01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
up the phone
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
and calls the New Hampshire State Police
 
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
gun line or the FBI Nick Center so I
 
01:49:50.090 --> 01:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
know with some Precision how the process
 
01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:52.129 align:start position:0%
know with some Precision how the process
works

01:49:52.129 --> 01:49:52.139 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
background checks are a Consumer Fraud I
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
heard prior testimony that 90 of
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
Americans support them
 
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
may be true no Source was cited for the
 
01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:06.169 align:start position:0%
may be true no Source was cited for the
data

01:50:06.169 --> 01:50:06.179 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
okay so here are some foundational facts
 
01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:14.699 align:start position:0%
as at the end of 2020 there were in the
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
United States approximately
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
454 million firearms
 
01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
that data point is from U.S Department
 
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
of Justice
 
01:50:31.090 --> 01:50:31.100 align:start position:0%
Firearms Commerce in the United States
 
01:50:33.129 --> 01:50:33.139 align:start position:0%
issues of
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
2000 and
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
2020 sorry 2022 5 May
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
so there is a far more
 
01:50:48.189 --> 01:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
than one firearm for every U.S resident
 
01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
including infants who usually don't own
 
01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
much and we hope they don't own firearms
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
my point is real simple
 
01:51:00.189 --> 01:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
anything so numerous
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
mainly concealable can not be controlled
 
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
the effort is for doomed
 
01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
to pursue it is akin to doing what was
 
01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
done in the ex-soviet union where it was
 
01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
thought if all factory farm mine Forest
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
etc etc output
 
01:51:28.189 --> 01:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
is governed by quotas set by planners
 
01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
sitting in offices in Moscow
 
01:51:35.090 --> 01:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
we will eliminate waste we will be super
 
01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
efficient and we will overtake the
 
01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:40.550 align:start position:0%
efficient and we will overtake the
capitalists

01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
capitalists
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
I have little background in this realm I
 
01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
used to lecture Russian and Soviet
 
01:51:49.250 --> 01:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
studies at University level
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
well they pursued this they committed a
 
01:51:58.129 --> 01:51:58.139 align:start position:0%
genocide in order to break opposition to
 
01:52:02.050 --> 01:52:02.060 align:start position:0%
this approach to managing the economy
 
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
and as the evidence mounted that this
 
01:52:10.129 --> 01:52:10.139 align:start position:0%
approach made Soviet citizens poorer not
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
richer they doubled down
 
01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
eventually the Soviet Union went
 
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.930 align:start position:0%
eventually the Soviet Union went
bankrupt

01:52:17.930 --> 01:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
bankrupt
 
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
so my point is there are some ideas that
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
get a really strong grip but they're
 
01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:26.149 align:start position:0%
get a really strong grip but they're
flawed

01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
flawed
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
and the approach the idea that
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
background checks stop bad folks from
 
01:52:36.490 --> 01:52:36.500 align:start position:0%
getting weapons is such a flawed idea
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'll preface it by a statement that the
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
federal authorities do almost nothing to
 
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
the attempt by someone
 
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
to get a weapon from a dealer
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
and to lie in the process is a federal
 
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
and to lie in the process is a federal
felony

01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
felony
 
01:53:10.609 --> 01:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
specifically it is a violation of 18 U.S
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
code section 922 small a 6.
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
this felony is punishable by a fine up
 
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
to ten thousand dollars and or
 
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
a prison sentence sorry a sentence up to
 
01:53:32.530 --> 01:53:32.540 align:start position:0%
10 years in federal prison and or a fine
 
01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
up to 250
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
000 dollars
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
you could say that's a pretty good
 
01:53:39.179 --> 01:53:40.370 align:start position:0%
you could say that's a pretty good
punishment

01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
here's the problem
 
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
the feds rarely prosecute those who lie
 
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
here's some data points from 2010
 
01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:54.050 align:start position:0%
here's some data points from 2010
of

01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.729 align:start position:0%
of
76

01:53:55.729 --> 01:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
76
 
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
000 denials there were 62 prosecutions
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
fast forward 2018
 
01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:08.699 align:start position:0%
government accountability office study
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
of 12
 
01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
000 denials referred for investigation
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
there were count them you'll have to
 
01:54:24.169 --> 01:54:24.179 align:start position:0%
take off one shoot 12 prosecutions
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
in short the feds do not enforce
 
01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties on those who lie to
 
01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.850 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties on those who lie to
dealers

01:54:34.850 --> 01:54:34.860 align:start position:0%
dealers
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
and these penalties have been on the
 
01:54:37.739 --> 01:54:38.810 align:start position:0%
and these penalties have been on the
books

01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
if memory serves since 1968.
 
01:54:47.169 --> 01:54:47.179 align:start position:0%
quick things have changed since 2018
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
possible but here's why I doubt it if
 
01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:54.860 align:start position:0%
you looked at the number of cases
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
bioed by U.S attorneys Nationwide
 
01:55:04.510 --> 01:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
for them to have prosecuted
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
those mentioned in the GAO study 12 000
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
plus denials
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
the U.S attorneys would have little time
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
to prosecute other cases
 
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
Espionage Securities fraud
 
01:55:24.649 --> 01:55:24.659 align:start position:0%
etc etc
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
in short
 
01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
the feds don't only not prosecute those
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
who lie to dealers if they did
 
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much the only crime that
 
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
would actually
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
be prosecuted by federal prosecutors we
 
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
simply don't have the infrastructure the
 
01:55:51.169 --> 01:55:51.179 align:start position:0%
human infrastructure
 
01:55:51.179 --> 01:55:52.870 align:start position:0%
human infrastructure
to

01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:55:56.090 --> 01:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
prosecute bad guys who try to get
 
01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:57.370 align:start position:0%
prosecute bad guys who try to get
weapons

01:55:57.370 --> 01:55:57.380 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
01:55:59.570 --> 01:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
in short
 
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
I understand that a lot of folks put
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
Faith in background checks they are as
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
much in error as were the Soviets who
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
insisted that making all output
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
decisions in Moscow would make Soviet
 
01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
citizens wealthier
 
01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
they were simply wrong history has
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
judged the fact that the folks now in
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
charge of the Soviet Union look back
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
with longing to the Soviet era
 
01:56:44.649 --> 01:56:44.659 align:start position:0%
is proof positive that some ideas
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
plainly failed
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
have an unbreakable grip
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
background checks is one of those ideas
 
01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:56.410 align:start position:0%
background checks is one of those ideas
unless

01:56:56.410 --> 01:56:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
we meaning the taxpayers are willing to
 
01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
hire enough Federal prosecutors and
 
01:57:09.250 --> 01:57:09.260 align:start position:0%
build enough prison space
 
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
to put behind bars those who lie
 
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
in closing in the 20 plus years that
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
we've had background checks they began
 
01:57:25.129 --> 01:57:25.139 align:start position:0%
in November 1998
 
01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'm a small-scale dealer I've had two
 
01:57:30.290 --> 01:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
persons deny
 
01:57:34.609 --> 01:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
both of whom were not murderers bank
 
01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
robbers or racists
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
because I was told by the reviewing
 
01:57:39.719 --> 01:57:41.149 align:start position:0%
because I was told by the reviewing
Authority

01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
have your customer call us meaning to
 
01:57:48.649 --> 01:57:48.659 align:start position:0%
the gun line and we will tell them
 
01:57:48.659 --> 01:57:50.390 align:start position:0%
the gun line and we will tell them
what

01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
matter in their record makes them
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
disqualified one of the two men then in
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
his 40s
 
01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.430 align:start position:0%
his 40s
said

01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
I will pursue this
 
01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
six months later he comes back told me
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
it took me nineteen hundred dollars in
 
01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees the matters been cleared
 
01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:12.649 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees the matters been cleared
up

01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:12.659 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
I had held the firearmed for him no
 
01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
cause to him
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
I redid the background check he passed
 
01:58:24.169 --> 01:58:24.179 align:start position:0%
he left with his weapon the other fellow
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
never heard from him maybe he didn't
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
have that kind of money don't know
 
01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
said what
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of millions of them
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
quantitatively this Pro
 
01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's for there's an idea that I've just
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
shown you quantitatively is nonsense
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
and I respectfully suggest
 
01:58:59.209 --> 01:58:59.219 align:start position:0%
you do not enact it because to enact it
 
01:59:00.669 --> 01:59:00.679 align:start position:0%
would suggest
 
01:59:03.530 --> 01:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
that you the members of the committee
 
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
and the members of this honorable house
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
cannot do basic math
 
01:59:13.070 --> 01:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
I have not only no reason to think you
 
01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
can do basic math I suspect you can do
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
it without using a calculator
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be happy to take any
 
01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:24.350 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be happy to take any
questions

01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
um I add only that in my submitted
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
testimony the data sources are provided
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can look at them with your own eyes
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and thank you for
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair calls Tom mannion
 
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:46.020 align:start position:0%

01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Maria Perez
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tom minion I
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro One Pelham I'm here
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
to testify an opposition of HP 59. to
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
start this bill opens with the
 
02:00:00.649 --> 02:00:00.659 align:start position:0%
definition of commercial sales including
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
gifts so let me run a hypothetical about
 
02:00:04.970 --> 02:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
you my father is raising his son way up
 
02:00:07.129 --> 02:00:07.139 align:start position:0%
in Coos County they go hunting target
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
shooting on weekends the sun is raised
 
02:00:11.089 --> 02:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
in a gun friendly environment is very
 
02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
well trained and capable thanks to the
 
02:00:15.169 --> 02:00:15.179 align:start position:0%
great mentorship of his father when the
 
02:00:16.729 --> 02:00:16.739 align:start position:0%
father deemed his son to be mature
 
02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
enough the father gives his son the
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
rifle they've been using for years as a
 
02:00:22.129 --> 02:00:22.139 align:start position:0%
birthday gift same as his father did
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
before him it's now the sons to own his
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
eyes light up with Wonder Smiles spreads
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
across his face and dad is now guilty of
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
a Class B misdemeanor thanks to HB 59
 
02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
tough break pops since FFL firearm
 
02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
purchases are already subject to
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
background checks I want to highlight
 
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
what I believe to be unconstitutional an
 
02:00:44.089 --> 02:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
ATF Form 4473 if we're going to be lap
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
dogs to arbitrary Federal rules I think
 
02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
I should elaborate exactly what that
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
entails and how it's a violation granted
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
standards rights I want to credit
 
02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
Liberty block for bringing this in my
 
02:00:54.290 --> 02:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
attention and all the times I've
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
completed this form I hit the specific
 
02:00:58.129 --> 02:00:58.139 align:start position:0%
legal language the ATF uses never popped
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
out of me question 11b states are you
 
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
under indictment or information in court
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
for a felony or any other crime which a
 
02:01:07.850 --> 02:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
judge could imprison you for more than
 
02:01:08.810 --> 02:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
one year
 
02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
indictment not guilty of so no trial no
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
jury no conviction no sentence yet
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
answering yes would prohibit purchase of
 
02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
a firearm so you're being denied Liberty
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
without due process of law and being
 
02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
forced to Bear witness against yourself
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
this violates the Fifth Amendment
 
02:01:24.649 --> 02:01:24.659 align:start position:0%
question 11c covers conviction so 11b
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
sticks out unnecessary and
 
02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh and subject to
 
02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
felony convictions of firearms uh for
 
02:01:32.689 --> 02:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
and Firearm ownership is in a bill that
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
this committee's already heard and I've
 
02:01:35.689 --> 02:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
already submitted testimony for uh
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
question 11 e states are you an unlawful
 
02:01:40.729 --> 02:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
user of or addicted to marijuana or
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
antidepressant stimulant narcotic drug
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
or other controlled substance and then
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
in bold it says warning the use or
 
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
possession of marijuana remains unlawful
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
under federal law regardless of whether
 
02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's been legalized or decriminalized
 
02:01:55.729 --> 02:01:55.739 align:start position:0%
for medical recreational purposes in the
 
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
state where you reside
 
02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:00.179 align:start position:0%
the question is dubiously worded and it
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
says unlawful user and immediately
 
02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
reminds you that any use of marijuana is
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
unlawful this question as with all these
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
violates fifth amendment protection
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
against bearing witness against oneself
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
as well as the 10th Amendment which
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
gives off all authority not explicitly
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
outlined in the U.S Constitution of the
 
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
states which includes drugs
 
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh this goes on uh but I would argue
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be completing these
 
02:02:20.209 --> 02:02:20.219 align:start position:0%
forms in the first place let alone
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
making a dad-run one for gifting a son
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
to his rifle criminals do not acquire
 
02:02:26.209 --> 02:02:26.219 align:start position:0%
arms through these means they steal them
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
or federal agencies like those during
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the Obama Administration Ferry them to
 
02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
Mexico and they come back and sit into
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
circulation that way I also uh it also
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
won't be long before the newly
 
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
taliban-owned arms make their way around
 
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
the planet I'm certain the dod didn't
 
02:02:40.609 --> 02:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
run background checks on those guys
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
before leaving them guns I asked there's

I asked this committee to support this
bill

02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.000 align:start position:0%

in office in us we see an upcoming
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%

um I just want to make a comment
 
02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
um the rights delayed is a right
 
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
infringed and given forcing the
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
background checks on all commercial
 
02:05:48.169 --> 02:05:48.179 align:start position:0%
sales can potentially add unforeseen
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
delays that the customer may have no
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
control over and therefore cannot
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights for nothing of
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
their own doing
 
02:05:58.490 --> 02:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
um I also remember uh somebody mentioned
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh marijuana use there was a recent
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling saying marijuana
 
02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
users cannot be denied uh Firearms so
 
02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
just more further proof that uh the
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
background the forcing the background
 
02:06:13.129 --> 02:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
check is is not a good thing and
 
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill should be ideal
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%

October 13th of 2021 at the executive
 
02:07:19.490 --> 02:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
council meeting where I was arrested for
 
02:07:22.129 --> 02:07:22.139 align:start position:0%
uttering the word amen I am still
 
02:07:24.290 --> 02:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
awaiting my trial date after six
 
02:07:27.649 --> 02:07:27.659 align:start position:0%
hearings with zero evidence that I made
 
02:07:30.109 --> 02:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
any such word
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
our second amendment by our forefathers
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
was to protect our first
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
I can't help but see people jump from
 
02:07:40.729 --> 02:07:40.739 align:start position:0%
high-rise buildings in China where my
 
02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
exchange students came from and told me
 
02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
what it was like in their country to
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
know that our forefathers put our Second
 
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment there to protect us from a
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
government that comes in to violate our
 
02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:51.470 align:start position:0%
government that comes in to violate our
rights

02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm now aware that if my husband and I
 
02:07:56.570 --> 02:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
go and purchase a couple of guns it gets
 
02:07:58.370 --> 02:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
reported to our chief of police in our
 
02:07:58.380 --> 02:07:59.330 align:start position:0%
reported to our chief of police in our
town

02:07:59.330 --> 02:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:08:02.209 --> 02:08:02.219 align:start position:0%
it's registered why is it registered
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
we've already seen the ATF knock on
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
doors to say hey I just want to make
 
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
sure those two guns you just bought they
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
actually went to you can we take a look
 
02:08:13.070 --> 02:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
at them why is the government taking a
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
list of who's burying arms
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
our forefathers gave us that right to
 
02:08:19.850 --> 02:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
protect us from becoming China or North
 
02:08:22.450 --> 02:08:22.460 align:start position:0%
Korea we need to understand our history
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
we care about our children our future we
 
02:08:27.169 --> 02:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we're able to
 
02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
protect ourselves and I'm here to tell
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
you after living through the Rodney King
 
02:08:33.709 --> 02:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
riots in East L.A while I was in college
 
02:08:36.649 --> 02:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
at Azusa Pacific when things go bad they
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
go bad very very quickly
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
and the people who are going to do
 
02:08:44.209 --> 02:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
criminal activity with a firearm are not
 
02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
the ones that are going to go somewhere
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
where they have to have a background
 
02:08:46.739 --> 02:08:47.930 align:start position:0%
where they have to have a background
check

02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
check
 
02:08:51.229 --> 02:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
there is a way with our open borders for
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
people to very easily get their hands on
 
02:08:56.570 --> 02:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
the firearm show up at a school show up
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
at a polling place do whatever the heck
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
they want to do
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
and you're only penalizing those of us
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
that are trying to protect this country
 
02:09:08.330 --> 02:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
you took a note to preserve our
 
02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:09.830 align:start position:0%
you took a note to preserve our
constitution

02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
each and every one of you
 
02:09:15.410 --> 02:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
I don't want a child to be in a shooting
 
02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
I feel as though my children my two
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
little boys would be safer if I knew
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
that there was someone at their public
 
02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
school that was a responsible gun owner
 
02:09:25.729 --> 02:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
that if something happened they could
 
02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
protect those children quicker than
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
police and the EMS could get there
 
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
we've already seen our state troopers
 
02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:34.619 align:start position:0%
come tap me on the shoulder four of them
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
tell me to come to the back of the room
 
02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
put me into the back of a Paddy Wagon
 
02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
make me urinate in front of the glass
 
02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
wall in front of grown men
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
for doing nothing
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
if they can do that by our governor
 
02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
sununu who I voted for
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
please do not let us become China do not
 
02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
let us become North Korea
 
02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
our children deserve America that our
 
02:10:04.010 --> 02:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
forefathers fought for
 
02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to oppose anything
 
02:10:08.930 --> 02:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
table anything that comes up to you
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
today that violates our rights as
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizens to safely have a
 
02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:15.830 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizens to safely have a
firearm

02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
02:10:18.169 --> 02:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
without any sort of government overreach
 
02:10:21.169 --> 02:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
or infringement or to be on a list where
 
02:10:22.609 --> 02:10:22.619 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get tapped on the shoulder
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
and told to get into a Paddy Wagon
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
because I'm there trying to protect my
 
02:10:28.609 --> 02:10:28.619 align:start position:0%
family from a government that's gone
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
sideways that's what our forefathers
 
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
wanted for each and every one of us God
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
bless each of you for your time serving
 
02:10:36.350 --> 02:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
our our legislative body and our
 
02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:38.149 align:start position:0%
our our legislative body and our
citizens

02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:42.169 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

02:10:42.169 --> 02:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
the chair calls William Rosen
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
and up next will be Leonard Dr Leonard
 
02:10:51.719 --> 02:10:53.390 align:start position:0%
and up next will be Leonard Dr Leonard
Cohen

02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
Cohen
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't see anybody else so
 
02:10:59.149 --> 02:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
I I think my penmanship got me again
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I butchered your Lane
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
Knoxville William Rogers
 
02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
02:11:08.089 --> 02:11:08.099 align:start position:0%
um this bill seems like a solution
 
02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem
 
02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
frankly I was confused by it because I
 
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
thought it covered just commercial sales
 
02:11:18.109 --> 02:11:18.119 align:start position:0%
but then you look it calls a private
 
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
sale a commercial sale all commercial
 
02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
sales are already under federal
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
background checks private sale that says
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to exempt it I don't
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
understand I'm not as smart as
 
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
Representatives 10 of them but I don't
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand it's confusing to me so I'll
 
02:11:38.089 --> 02:11:38.099 align:start position:0%
I'll trust your judgment because you
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
guys are obviously a lot smarter than me
 
02:11:43.149 --> 02:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
and can figure it out so thank you
 
02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
chair calls Dr Cohen and up next will be
 
02:11:56.930 --> 02:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:59.629 --> 02:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
so I have some written testimony which I
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:08.159 --> 02:12:16.149 align:start position:0%
 
me

02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.649 --> 02:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
six of the other guild build gun bills
 
02:12:24.659 --> 02:12:26.030 align:start position:0%
six of the other guild build gun bills
today

02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
are a response to a problem that exists
 
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
in the United States
 
02:12:36.770 --> 02:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:40.609 --> 02:12:40.619 align:start position:0%
we do not have the safety in the United
 
02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:42.169 align:start position:0%
we do not have the safety in the United
States

02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
States
 
02:12:45.229 --> 02:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
that Norway
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
and Great Britain and France and Germany
 
02:12:51.250 --> 02:12:51.260 align:start position:0%
and every other
 
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
civilized Western Society has we have
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
more than 25 times the gun violence of
 
02:13:03.069 --> 02:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
those other
 
02:13:06.250 --> 02:13:06.260 align:start position:0%
Democratic countries
 
02:13:09.370 --> 02:13:09.380 align:start position:0%
why does this exist
 
02:13:14.089 --> 02:13:14.099 align:start position:0%
partly or mostly it exists because we
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't have common sense
 
02:13:20.450 --> 02:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
gun was
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't it make sense
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
if a person wants to buy a gun that they
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
pass a background check
 
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
why is that so unreasonable I don't
 
02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:40.430 align:start position:0%
why is that so unreasonable I don't
understand

02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.089 --> 02:13:44.099 align:start position:0%
the background check Bill exists to
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
prevent people
 
02:13:50.089 --> 02:13:50.099 align:start position:0%
who have committed felonies and have
 
02:13:56.450 --> 02:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:58.569 --> 02:13:58.579 align:start position:0%
we've heard it before
 
02:14:01.550 --> 02:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
seventy percent ninety percent of the
 
02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
citizens in this country want reasonable
 
02:14:08.589 --> 02:14:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
but the reason that we don't is that
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
politics rather than the will of the
 
02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:18.609 align:start position:0%
politics rather than the will of the
people

02:14:18.609 --> 02:14:18.619 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:14:22.250 --> 02:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
interferes with reasonable Common Sense
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.609 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:14:34.609 --> 02:14:34.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
about gum
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
it takes a person and a gun
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's the equation
 
02:14:48.370 --> 02:14:48.380 align:start position:0%
in order to reduce the very
 
02:14:51.850 --> 02:14:51.860 align:start position:0%
significant gun violence in this country
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
we have to attack both
 
02:14:59.089 --> 02:14:59.099 align:start position:0%
the person
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
and the easy availability of guns
 
02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
now I represent the New Hampshire
 
02:15:07.850 --> 02:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
Medical Society and the New Hampshire
 
02:15:11.330 --> 02:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Society
 
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm standing here is that
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
this is a lane
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
where we as Physicians
 
02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:22.129 align:start position:0%
where we as Physicians
occupy

02:15:22.129 --> 02:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
occupy
 
02:15:26.569 --> 02:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
we take care of the people who are
 
02:15:26.579 --> 02:15:27.950 align:start position:0%
we take care of the people who are
injured

02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
injured
 
02:15:30.770 --> 02:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
or killed and come to our emergency
 
02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:33.290 align:start position:0%
or killed and come to our emergency
rooms

02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
rooms
 
02:15:35.569 --> 02:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
if they're still alive
 
02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.729 --> 02:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
there are so many
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
horrible injuries
 
02:15:51.010 --> 02:15:51.020 align:start position:0%
as well as deaths every year every day
 
02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
more than 120
 
02:15:58.250 --> 02:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
people die of gun violence every day in
 
02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
the United States it's unconscionable
 
02:16:06.770 --> 02:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
and every reasonable gun law that comes
 
02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
ought to be passed so that we can do
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:30.649 --> 02:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
the background check law is really the
 
02:16:33.169 --> 02:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
Bedrock of
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
of reasonable gun laws it's a simple law
 
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
it requires people who want to have a
 
02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:43.730 align:start position:0%
it requires people who want to have a
gun

02:16:43.730 --> 02:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
gun
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
to pass certain requirements that
 
02:16:48.410 --> 02:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
they're safe
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
to have a gun that's all
 
02:16:53.570 --> 02:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you from
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony does anybody
 
02:16:58.490 --> 02:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
um Mr Brian Blackman and up at next will
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
I ask you to itl this bill as I started
 
02:17:18.349 --> 02:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:21.169 --> 02:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
I was very happy I was doing my job as
 
02:17:25.009 --> 02:17:25.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:27.770 --> 02:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
and it looked like at first glance
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
somebody just cut and pasted part of the
 
02:17:33.169 --> 02:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
ATF rules to tell me what to do
 
02:17:36.589 --> 02:17:36.599 align:start position:0%
until I got to this bill excludes
 
02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
private non-commercial sales or
 
02:17:40.669 --> 02:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
transfers between individuals provided
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
neither individual is prohibited from
 
02:17:45.049 --> 02:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
owning or possessing a firearm under
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
and this is where it gets a little
 
02:17:54.530 --> 02:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
fuzzy for me
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
as far as the definition of commercial
 
02:17:56.880 --> 02:18:00.290 align:start position:0%
as far as the definition of commercial
sale

02:18:00.290 --> 02:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.410 --> 02:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
it says
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
ownership of a firearm including but not
 
02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.519 align:start position:0%
limited to a sale exchange or gift
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's not commercial
 
02:18:13.370 --> 02:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
and on the front here it says this
 
02:18:16.730 --> 02:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
excludes private non-commercial sales
 
02:18:19.370 --> 02:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
that's a conflict to me
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
except when you get to number two it
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
says if neither party to perspective
 
02:18:25.790 --> 02:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
Firearms transactions is it is a
 
02:18:28.129 --> 02:18:28.139 align:start position:0%
licensed Firearms dealer
 
02:18:30.169 --> 02:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
the parties to the transaction shall
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
commit shall complete the commercial
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
sale through a license Firearms dealer
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
what you're doing in this basically
 
02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
is making all private sales commercial
 
02:18:48.169 --> 02:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
that's all that's happening here I
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
already do background checks I actually
 
02:18:52.129 --> 02:18:52.139 align:start position:0%
do a lot of private party background
 
02:18:52.139 --> 02:18:53.290 align:start position:0%
do a lot of private party background
checks

02:18:53.290 --> 02:18:53.300 align:start position:0%
checks
 
02:18:56.450 --> 02:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
but this is forcing people
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
and to me that's nothing more at
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
blocking and tracking Private Sales
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
and noted in number six in the bill mail
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
order sales are now required to go
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
through an FFL
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
they do now there's no need for that to
 
02:19:25.009 --> 02:19:25.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
and under Section
 
02:19:33.770 --> 02:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
6 2A that is a violation of federal law
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
because once an FFL takes possession of
 
02:19:38.889 --> 02:19:38.899 align:start position:0%
a firearm it puts it in their Bone book
 
02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
that gun doesn't leave their possession
 
02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't leave that door until the next
 
02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
check is done
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
So for anybody
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
to think that they're going to give an
 
02:19:52.490 --> 02:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
acapella gun then walk out the door with
 
02:19:53.929 --> 02:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
it they're crazy it's not going to
 
02:19:53.939 --> 02:19:54.710 align:start position:0%
it they're crazy it's not going to
happen

02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's a federal it's it's a against
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
and all you're doing at that point is
 
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
making FFL deals criminals that's all
 
02:20:10.610 --> 02:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
that does
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
as far as criminal penalties under RSA
 
02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
159 f
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
or 1A of this
 
02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill criminal deterrence of a
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor is a joke if you're
 
02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
trying to appear tough on crime
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
considering consensual Act of public sex
 
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.250 --> 02:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
in my opinion this bill would be found
 
02:20:39.250 --> 02:20:39.260 align:start position:0%
to be unconstitutional
 
02:20:41.210 --> 02:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and maybe the office
 
02:20:43.370 --> 02:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
should know the requirements of being an
 
02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:48.290 align:start position:0%
should know the requirements of being an
FFL

02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
and this bill also makes a private sale
 
02:20:53.870 --> 02:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
commercial in one direct contradiction
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
to the private sale description in House
 
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
Bill 351 FN if you compare the two bills
 
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
please itl this Bill thank you
 
02:21:15.670 --> 02:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
Brian Mary and up next will be Kimberly
 
02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:21.349 align:start position:0%
Brian Mary and up next will be Kimberly
Moore

02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
Moore
 
02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone again whoa
 
02:21:27.610 --> 02:21:27.620 align:start position:0%
you did fix that problem huh
 
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like to draw your attention to New
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to go down to Article 2 B right to
 
02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:39.950 align:start position:0%
going to go down to Article 2 B right to
privacy

02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
02:21:42.110 --> 02:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
and individuals right to live free
 
02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
through governmental intrusion in
 
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
private our personal information is
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
natural essential or inherent
 
02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
as is pointed out prior by some other
 
02:21:55.550 --> 02:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
testimony there are problems with the
 
02:21:58.370 --> 02:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
federal background check
 
02:22:00.290 --> 02:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
that's for another day
 
02:22:02.809 --> 02:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
let's talk about New Hampshire
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
the analysis of 59
 
02:22:08.330 --> 02:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
shows that this bill requires commercial
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
firearm sales or transfers in this state
 
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
to be subject to a criminal background
 
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
check and providing criminal penalty for
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
a violation
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
the bill excludes private non-commercial
 
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
sales or transfers between individuals
 
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
provided neither individual is
 
02:22:28.429 --> 02:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
prohibited from owning or possessing a
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
firearm under the state of federal law
 
02:22:33.410 --> 02:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
sounds reasonable right
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out already
 
02:22:38.570 --> 02:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
commercial CL definition I don't get
 
02:22:40.730 --> 02:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
rehashed out you guys right get that
 
02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:41.750 align:start position:0%
rehashed out you guys right get that
down

02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
but on page two line three
 
02:22:46.370 --> 02:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
if neither party is through a
 
02:22:51.410 --> 02:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
prospective Firearms transaction is a
 
02:22:53.330 --> 02:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
licensed Firearms dealer
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
the parties to the transaction shall
 
02:23:00.170 --> 02:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
complete the commercial sale
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
through a licensed Firearms deal as
 
02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:03.110 align:start position:0%
through a licensed Firearms deal as
follows

02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
follows
 
02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:04.490 align:start position:0%
follows
shop

02:23:04.490 --> 02:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
shop
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
what should shall words matter
 
02:23:10.730 --> 02:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
this does eliminate Private Sales
 
02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
and it contradicts the analysis on the
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
front page of it
 
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
I would like if you could please
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
respectfully read that when you have a
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
chance and and see if if I'm
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
a little bit off there
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
we already know that in a private sale
 
02:23:30.590 --> 02:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
we are responsible to make sure we know
 
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
who the person is we're selling to
 
02:23:34.130 --> 02:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
to make sure that person isn't a
 
02:23:36.050 --> 02:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
prohibited person that falls on us
 
02:23:38.330 --> 02:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
already it's already in law
 
02:23:40.969 --> 02:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
and and that's common sense
 
02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't come up to someone like oh
 
02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
yeah flea market by a gun sure see you
 
02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:45.770 align:start position:0%
yeah flea market by a gun sure see you
later

02:23:45.770 --> 02:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
most responsible citizens who own guns
 
02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
and sell guns and buy guns look for
 
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
something a little more definitive
 
02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
do you have a PNR license with you
 
02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
do you have your state ID can I see
 
02:23:58.730 --> 02:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
those please
 
02:24:00.349 --> 02:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
okay let's do a transaction together
 
02:24:02.809 --> 02:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
take a picture of it fully document it
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
where good if something happens
 
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government provides for
 
02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:08.929 align:start position:0%
the federal government provides for
transactions

02:24:08.929 --> 02:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
02:24:11.450 --> 02:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
to be put through the system
 
02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
on Private Sales as well they encourage
 
02:24:16.370 --> 02:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
it hey you met off
 
02:24:20.330 --> 02:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
website X if you are hey you know what
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
let's go to a gun store and do this the
 
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
right way
 
02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
all right I don't know who you are we
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
just met online
 
02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
these steps are already in place
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
but this isn't going to prevent
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
a criminal
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
from obtaining a gun illegally the way
 
02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
criminal still
 
02:24:43.969 --> 02:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:45.469 --> 02:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
I think we have a little bit of
 
02:24:48.170 --> 02:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
government intrusion to our lives now
 
02:24:51.050 --> 02:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
a little more than I like
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think that
 
02:24:54.889 --> 02:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
we the citizenry as a whole should be
 
02:24:54.899 --> 02:24:55.910 align:start position:0%
we the citizenry as a whole should be
penalized

02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
penalized
 
02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
for the crimes I feel
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
let's focus on the people who are doing
 
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
the wrong things let's bring them the
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
task let's get them in the system
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
let's have them
 
02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
realize the consequences of their
 
02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:08.870 align:start position:0%
realize the consequences of their
actions

actions
 
02:25:10.730 --> 02:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
instead of being leaning on them all the
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
time and understanding and yeah okay
 
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
you're a criminal you're doing it you
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
know what you're doing
 
02:25:20.929 --> 02:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen I oppose this
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
background checks exist already in two
 
02:25:27.050 --> 02:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
forms federally next at the state level
 
02:25:29.450 --> 02:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
through the gun line
 
02:25:32.210 --> 02:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
the gun Line's a good idea because
 
02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
it will
 
02:25:37.550 --> 02:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
show prohibited person status on the
 
02:25:39.170 --> 02:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
state level quicker than it would get
 
02:25:41.809 --> 02:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
into the federal system
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's not a bad thing
 
02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
and the federal background check system
 
02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
works I've had the Niles I'm an active
 
02:25:49.610 --> 02:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
FFL by the way next level Firearms so
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking from current experience
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
it works
 
02:25:56.210 --> 02:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect
 
02:25:57.530 --> 02:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
some of the language in the federal
 
02:26:00.889 --> 02:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
portions on a 4473 I don't like
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
but as far as this Private Sales
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
02:26:08.570 --> 02:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
just being a dead hustle honestly guys
 
02:26:10.429 --> 02:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
and I will take questions if people want
 
02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
to come by and get me I'm right here
 
02:26:15.530 --> 02:26:15.540 align:start position:0%

for at least 10 years maybe more hasn't
 
02:26:41.410 --> 02:26:41.420 align:start position:0%
changed much over the years it was
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
resurrected from the depths of hell with
 
02:26:46.370 --> 02:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
a few changes in language but with the
 
02:26:49.250 --> 02:26:49.260 align:start position:0%

felony conviction or indictment was the
 
02:29:47.929 --> 02:29:47.939 align:start position:0%

last year they did around 133 000

Private Sales at gun shows online or the
 
02:30:37.849 --> 02:30:37.859 align:start position:0%

background check
 
02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
requiring a background check every
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
single time a gun is sold is effective
 
02:30:46.130 --> 02:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
in keeping guns out of the hands of
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
those who should not have them
 
02:30:50.990 --> 02:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does that and it just makes
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
sense responsible gun owners should not
 
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
put guns in the hands of people that
 
02:30:59.210 --> 02:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
they do not know or do not know well
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
enough to know whether they are
 
02:31:04.010 --> 02:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
prohibited from possessing or owning a
 
02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:05.570 align:start position:0%

firearm
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
under this bill of gun sales including
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
online sales would require criminal
 
02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
background check through a federally
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
licensed dealer using the same
 
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
background check system already used in
 
02:31:17.330 --> 02:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
all dealer sales
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
it defines these as a transfer of
 
02:31:21.889 --> 02:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
ownership of a firearm including but not
 
02:31:24.250 --> 02:31:24.260 align:start position:0%
limited to a sale exchange or gift
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
transfers and exchanges are included
 
02:31:29.210 --> 02:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
because it is not uncommon for a firearm
 
02:31:30.770 --> 02:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
to be traded rather than sold for
 
02:31:32.330 --> 02:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
financial value
 
02:31:34.010 --> 02:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
this bill would help keep guns out of
 
02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
the hands of dangerous criminals and
 
02:31:36.889 --> 02:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
save lives
 
02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming 9 out of 10 Granite
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
State or support closing background
 
02:31:43.010 --> 02:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
check loopholes including a majority of
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
gun owners and NRA members
 
02:31:47.330 --> 02:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
what's more this bill closes what is
 
02:31:49.250 --> 02:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
known as the Charleston loophole
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
under federal law a licensed dealer May
 
02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
proceed with the sale with firearm after
 
02:31:55.250 --> 02:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
three business daily days the mandated
 
02:31:56.690 --> 02:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
background check has not yet been
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
completed and there's no confirmation
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
that the purchaser is legally permitted
 
02:32:02.690 --> 02:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
to have firearms we have seen how this
 
02:32:05.929 --> 02:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.969 --> 02:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
according to a fiscal note at the end of
 
02:32:11.090 --> 02:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
a similar bill in 2014 an estimated 33
 
02:32:13.370 --> 02:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
000 gun sales in New Hampshire did not
 
02:32:14.929 --> 02:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
go through the background checks process
 
02:32:16.429 --> 02:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
the previous year
 
02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of data on this this
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
is why I'm citing a 2014 piece in the
 
02:32:22.969 --> 02:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and we would love to see an
 
02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
updated piece in the in the other build
 
02:32:27.170 --> 02:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
this morning our office looked on
 
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
Armslist which advertises itself as an
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
online Firearms Marketplace there are
 
02:32:33.650 --> 02:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
over 80 firearms for sale or trade in
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire alone
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
the website has a disclaimer at advising
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
users to follow all federal and state
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
Firearms laws
 
02:32:43.070 --> 02:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
that is it
 
02:32:44.929 --> 02:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
you have to click a button saying yes
 
02:32:46.849 --> 02:32:46.859 align:start position:0%
I'm allowed to purchase a gun no
 
02:32:48.770 --> 02:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
questions asked no background check
 
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
there is no guaranteed individual seller
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
will require one there is however a
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
disclaimer alleviating the company and
 
02:32:58.490 --> 02:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
its owners from any liability
 
02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
it's high time we had a conversation
 
02:33:02.929 --> 02:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
about who can easily buy firearms in New
 
02:33:02.939 --> 02:33:04.250 align:start position:0%
about who can easily buy firearms in New
Hampshire

02:33:04.250 --> 02:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:33:06.170 --> 02:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
this bill does not affect law abiding
 
02:33:07.610 --> 02:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gun owners selling and
 
02:33:09.170 --> 02:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
trading guns between friends and family
 
02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
as long as no one is prohibited to own
 
02:33:14.990 --> 02:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
or possess a firearm it express
 
02:33:18.170 --> 02:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
expressly prohibits a gun registry we
 
02:33:19.490 --> 02:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
ask for your support and I'm happy to
 
02:33:25.370 --> 02:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:28.969 --> 02:33:28.979 align:start position:0%
chair calls Miss Penny Dean and up next
 
02:33:33.490 --> 02:33:33.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:36.050 --> 02:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
something you'll have to tell me how to
 
02:33:38.090 --> 02:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
pronounce it
 
02:33:43.250 --> 02:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:45.469 --> 02:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
my name is Penny Dean still and I'm
 
02:33:48.170 --> 02:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
still a Concord attorney and I'd like
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
you to itl this bill for several reasons
 
02:33:52.730 --> 02:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
and I always believe in starting in the
 
02:33:55.490 --> 02:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
basement when you're doing an analysis
 
02:33:58.250 --> 02:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
and the first thing is like a fish story
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
this bill has come back again and again
 
02:34:01.490 --> 02:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
we heard years ago that 50 to 55 percent
 
02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
of gun owners support it and then we
 
02:34:09.290 --> 02:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
heard it 60 and we heard 70 I heard 90
 
02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:10.490 align:start position:0%
heard it 60 and we heard 70 I heard 90
percent

02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:34:13.969 --> 02:34:13.979 align:start position:0%
and here's where I come from if I bring
 
02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
you studies or data I give you clear
 
02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.570 align:start position:0%
you studies or data I give you clear
sources

02:34:17.570 --> 02:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
sources
 
02:34:20.450 --> 02:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
of where I get those facts or data from
 
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
and everyone knows that where the study
 
02:34:25.010 --> 02:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
is conducted matter was it conducted
 
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
outside of Sarah Brady supporters for
 
02:34:29.570 --> 02:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
handgun violence or was it you know
 
02:34:31.370 --> 02:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
conducted outside an NRA convention
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
those things matter
 
02:34:35.330 --> 02:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
and I think you hear a variety of
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
numbers but I think what matters is we
 
02:34:39.950 --> 02:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
elected a majority of Republican
 
02:34:42.650 --> 02:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
legislature and if everybody wanted gun
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
control in the state I think there'd be
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
400 plus Dems in here don't have that so
 
02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
I think that speaks but when you talk
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
about this bill itself specifically
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about what I call
 
02:34:57.410 --> 02:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
wrongful denials when we talk about how
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
many are denied
 
02:35:01.969 --> 02:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
I make a good amount of my living and
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
quite frankly a lot of the free time I
 
02:35:07.309 --> 02:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
do for people doing wrongful denials you
 
02:35:09.410 --> 02:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
don't know how often a person said I had
 
02:35:11.090 --> 02:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
one most recently said oh your client
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
has felony convictions
 
02:35:15.290 --> 02:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
I said Gee that's funny I've got
 
02:35:16.969 --> 02:35:16.979 align:start position:0%
certificates of annulment from the
 
02:35:18.650 --> 02:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
oh well we didn't get those entered
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
and so what you have last time I heard
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I've heard different numbers so I
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't pertain to represent to you the
 
02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
exact number between a hundred and
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand and two hundred and
 
02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand superior court records
 
02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
and court records that are not whether
 
02:35:43.849 --> 02:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
they be entered or entered correctly or
 
02:35:46.490 --> 02:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
reconciled whoops with the New Hampshire
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
criminal records database and I don't
 
02:35:51.889 --> 02:35:51.899 align:start position:0%
claim to know what one of those numbers
 
02:35:53.270 --> 02:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
are right I've heard different
 
02:35:55.790 --> 02:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
variations of them over the past four or
 
02:35:58.130 --> 02:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
five years but I will bet you a nickel
 
02:35:59.870 --> 02:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about well over a hundred
 
02:36:02.450 --> 02:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
thousand records and what you have are
 
02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
human beings entering data and with
 
02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
human beings human beings make errors
 
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
and so many many many gun denials that
 
02:36:16.250 --> 02:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
either delays or quite frankly outright
 
02:36:18.410 --> 02:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
denials that come from the New Hampshire
 
02:36:21.290 --> 02:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
State Police gun line are based on bad
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
data and I'm not cracking on the gum
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
line here I'm saying that it's based on
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
bad data and those people are lawfully
 
02:36:31.490 --> 02:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
entitled to buy firearms
 
02:36:33.710 --> 02:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
but what you have happening is think
 
02:36:36.530 --> 02:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
about the average working man it
 
02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes takes me I most recently took
 
02:36:40.130 --> 02:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
pity on a man and did one of the many
 
02:36:43.130 --> 02:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
freebie cases I do it took me 10 hours
 
02:36:45.710 --> 02:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
of my time to straighten out the fact
 
02:36:47.870 --> 02:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
that he was able to buy a gun he was
 
02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
denied they said he had felonies once we
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
looked into it two things had happened
 
02:36:56.570 --> 02:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
the gun line had not entered annulments
 
02:36:58.010 --> 02:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
that he had
 
02:37:01.550 --> 02:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a fee that a lot of people
 
02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't understand I put together a two to
 
02:37:06.530 --> 02:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
three page letter explaining to clients
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
how the annulment process works because
 
02:37:10.849 --> 02:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
it's not clear
 
02:37:12.349 --> 02:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
it took me a long time to put that
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
letter together and at the end of a
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
process when the average person gets a
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
certificate of annulment from the court
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
signed by a judge they think they can go
 
02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
out and buy a gun they got a certificate
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
of a Noma from a judge well if you don't
 
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
pay the state police a hundred dollars
 
02:37:30.349 --> 02:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
to enter in their system after that you
 
02:37:32.210 --> 02:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
can't buy a gun because your annulment
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
isn't entered even though you have that
 
02:37:37.130 --> 02:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
piece of paper from a judge now if you
 
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
have a lawyer like me who is known to be
 
02:37:41.450 --> 02:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
anal you're going to know that and I'm
 
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
going to hold your hand to the very end
 
02:37:45.770 --> 02:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
but there's
 
02:37:47.809 --> 02:37:47.819 align:start position:0%
some people who do annulments on their
 
02:37:49.730 --> 02:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
own they're poor or they think they can
 
02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
handle it themselves or there's other of
 
02:37:54.290 --> 02:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
my colleagues who I hate to admit don't
 
02:37:56.809 --> 02:37:56.819 align:start position:0%
do a job that I would be proud to do
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
but however you look at it there's many
 
02:38:02.450 --> 02:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
many wrongful denials that's number one
 
02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
and that's huge
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
because if you come to me and I say it's
 
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to cost probably a thousand to
 
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars best case
 
02:38:12.170 --> 02:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
scenario to try and figure out why you
 
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
were denied
 
02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
how many people can just write a check
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
like that think about their working
 
02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
constituents I mean doctors and lawyers
 
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we can write a check like that but
 
02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
working people that's a lot of money to
 
02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:23.630 align:start position:0%
working people that's a lot of money to
them

02:38:23.630 --> 02:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:38:26.690 --> 02:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
the next thing you have to look at here
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
is you look at what I call almost a fish
 
02:38:30.479 --> 02:38:31.790 align:start position:0%
is you look at what I call almost a fish
story

02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
story
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
and this is probably the one that
 
02:38:36.650 --> 02:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
offends me the most and I feel for women
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
I have a bad ankle got it from running
 
02:38:41.630 --> 02:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
and so I don't run anymore I barely walk
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that I can't defend
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
myself like I used to and I represent
 
02:38:49.010 --> 02:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
Sometimes women who they now need a gun
 
02:38:50.750 --> 02:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
they are physically afraid for their
 
02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:52.610 align:start position:0%
they are physically afraid for their
well-being

02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
02:38:55.070 --> 02:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
and they're going to have to wait
 
02:38:57.170 --> 02:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
and not even if there's a problem with
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
the record not be subjected to a
 
02:39:02.450 --> 02:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
three-day period right now under federal
 
02:39:04.730 --> 02:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
law the gun dealer can choose to let
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
that firearm go after three days and
 
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
they will have within three days of fire
 
02:39:10.849 --> 02:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
and let me tell you what happens all the
 
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
time police arrests go to a scene where
 
02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
there's domestic violence I had a client
 
02:39:18.230 --> 02:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
they arrested her husband and somehow
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's somebody clicked the box that
 
02:39:21.290 --> 02:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
they arrested her
 
02:39:23.389 --> 02:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
she wasn't able to buy a gun
 
02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
we're at the terrible most terrible time
 
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
in her life and she's going to wait how
 
02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:28.550 align:start position:0%
in her life and she's going to wait how
long

02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is anti-woman it's a horrible
 
02:39:33.770 --> 02:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
horrible bill but here's what's even
 
02:39:38.809 --> 02:39:38.819 align:start position:0%
worse you go down this and you say okay
 
02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
let's look just at the Drafting and I go
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
back to whoever drafted this doesn't
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
have subject matter confidence or
 
02:39:48.889 --> 02:39:48.899 align:start position:0%
they're deliberately as one client said
 
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
don't ever ascribe to malice what can be
 
02:39:53.630 --> 02:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
explained by incompetence so maybe we
 
02:39:55.849 --> 02:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
have incompetence here but if you look
 
02:39:58.490 --> 02:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
at page number one
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
and we look specifically at 9 30.
 
02:40:04.929 --> 02:40:04.939 align:start position:0%
possessing a firearm pursuant to 18 USD
 
02:40:08.690 --> 02:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
922d or pursuant to state law
 
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
well let me tell you what the drafter is
 
02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
evil either ignorantly left out or
 
02:40:14.650 --> 02:40:14.660 align:start position:0%
deliberately left out
 
02:40:18.530 --> 02:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
1822 or I'm sorry 922 D specifically
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
says if you have a state long
 
02:40:21.770 --> 02:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for which you received more
 
02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
than a Year's imprisonment you are
 
02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
barred from guns but that's not the end
 
02:40:27.530 --> 02:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
of the story you have to keep looking
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
and do a whole job here
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
18 USC 921 a20 amb says no a person can
 
02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
have a state court misdemeanor for up to
 
02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
two years
 
02:40:42.349 --> 02:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
and or have Anti-Trust violations and
 
02:40:44.030 --> 02:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
they can still have firearms
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
but if you enact this without that other
 
02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
exemption which is found in federal law
 
02:40:51.410 --> 02:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
you are foreclosing tons of people of
 
02:40:53.330 --> 02:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
their rights because what people in New
 
02:40:55.010 --> 02:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might not understand there are
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of Massachusetts residents come up
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
here Massachusetts has tons of two-year
 
02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:01.910 align:start position:0%
here Massachusetts has tons of two-year
misdemeanors

02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
02:41:03.889 --> 02:41:03.899 align:start position:0%
under this provision the way it's
 
02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
written all those men and women wouldn't
 
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
be able to buy firearms even though they
 
02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
can under federal law
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
we go to the back when people talk about
 
02:41:15.530 --> 02:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
loopholes loopholes is any law they
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
don't want and they want changed
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
the definition of loophole is very clear
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's an oversight
 
02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
the three day of letting people have a
 
02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
firearm if there's no response it's not
 
02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
a loophole it's deliberate it's to keep
 
02:41:30.650 --> 02:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
the government honest
 
02:41:33.290 --> 02:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
and to keep honest citizens to be able
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
to get Firearms instead of having what
 
02:41:38.270 --> 02:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
we had for some years at the gun line
 
02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
people dragging their feet or playing
 
02:41:43.490 --> 02:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
mini detective or doing whatever and
 
02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
taking days and days and days and weeks
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
and weeks and weeks and months and
 
02:41:48.410 --> 02:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
months and months to find out something
 
02:41:49.969 --> 02:41:49.979 align:start position:0%
that could have been found out in two or
 
02:41:51.650 --> 02:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
three days
 
02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
and so you look at that the other thing
 
02:41:55.730 --> 02:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
you have to look at
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
is on page two line six through 11.
 
02:42:03.290 --> 02:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
what you're doing is basically asking
 
02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
every federal firearms licensee in the
 
02:42:06.770 --> 02:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
country to violate federal law and
 
02:42:08.090 --> 02:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
pretty soon the ATF is going to
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
investigate all of you don't worry won't
 
02:42:11.650 --> 02:42:11.660 align:start position:0%
have a gun dealer in the country
 
02:42:15.230 --> 02:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
you can't ask or require these dealers
 
02:42:16.969 --> 02:42:16.979 align:start position:0%
to do something that violates the
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
provisions of federal law or the
 
02:42:20.510 --> 02:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
conditions of their license that's not
 
02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:22.550 align:start position:0%
conditions of their license that's not
reasonable

02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:42:24.770 --> 02:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
people have to look at this and we could
 
02:42:27.290 --> 02:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
go on and on and on and on
 
02:42:29.210 --> 02:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is the other thing
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
is dealers can't work for free these men
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
pay money they have overhead they're
 
02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to charge usually 25 to 50 bucks a
 
02:42:37.849 --> 02:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
check you're going to add that onto
 
02:42:39.410 --> 02:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
every gun
 
02:42:40.969 --> 02:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
think about that again for the average
 
02:42:42.410 --> 02:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
working guy who's going to buy a two
 
02:42:44.030 --> 02:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
three four hundred dollar gun
 
02:42:46.250 --> 02:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money people you know
 
02:42:48.410 --> 02:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
make x amount of dollars an hour
 
02:42:50.929 --> 02:42:50.939 align:start position:0%
but in short there's a lot of mechanical
 
02:42:53.210 --> 02:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
defects in this bill in addition to the
 
02:42:54.889 --> 02:42:54.899 align:start position:0%
fact that quite frankly I'm
 
02:42:57.469 --> 02:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
ideologically opposed to it there's no
 
02:42:59.090 --> 02:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
reason to have it to begin with this is
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
not worth fixing you're going to make a
 
02:43:03.050 --> 02:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
father go get permission to give the
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
family rifle to the Sun
 
02:43:07.010 --> 02:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
you know when they talk about these
 
02:43:08.690 --> 02:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
internet gun sales that's the biggest
 
02:43:11.330 --> 02:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
crack of horse feathers I've ever heard
 
02:43:14.270 --> 02:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
it is illegal to have Interstate sale
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
between private individuals non-licensed
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
people it's illegal now it just doesn't
 
02:43:21.710 --> 02:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
happen and when it does the ATF cracks
 
02:43:23.690 --> 02:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
down on it so I'm happy to answer any
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
questions you have
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
but as a practical matter this is
 
02:43:30.349 --> 02:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
horrible and you put the gum line in
 
02:43:32.570 --> 02:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
quite frankly a bad position asking them
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
to do things I'm not sure they can do
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
and when I say legally I'm not saying
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
they couldn't mechanically potentially
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
do them but you're putting them in a
 
02:43:39.359 --> 02:43:40.910 align:start position:0%
do them but you're putting them in a
position

02:43:40.910 --> 02:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:43:42.889 --> 02:43:42.899 align:start position:0%
and asking them probably to violate
 
02:43:44.330 --> 02:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
several agreements they have with the
 
02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
a chair
 
02:43:58.130 --> 02:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:02.450 --> 02:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
it's okay it's Korea sakikini um sure I
 
02:44:05.330 --> 02:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
I wasn't planning on speaking today
 
02:44:08.510 --> 02:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
um but I am speaking on behalf of my two
 
02:44:12.050 --> 02:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
children Owen who is six years old and
 
02:44:14.690 --> 02:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
Zaya who is two years old and I'm
 
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
acutely aware that there are mothers and
 
02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
fathers in this country whose children
 
02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
are not alive and do not have the
 
02:44:25.969 --> 02:44:25.979 align:start position:0%
privilege to stand here and to advocate
 
02:44:27.530 --> 02:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
for this bill because their children
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
have been slaughtered by people who were
 
02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
able to get guns who we know never
 
02:44:36.050 --> 02:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
should have had those guns in their
 
02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:37.309 align:start position:0%
should have had those guns in their
hands

02:44:37.309 --> 02:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
hands
 
02:44:39.950 --> 02:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
the children in this country and in this
 
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
state do not have the privilege to be
 
02:44:44.030 --> 02:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
here before you
 
02:44:47.690 --> 02:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
to plead with you to do what is right to
 
02:44:49.010 --> 02:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
protect them
 
02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
there are mothers in the state who
 
02:44:53.630 --> 02:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
cannot be here right now because they
 
02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
are caring for their children who they
 
02:44:59.389 --> 02:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
trust you to protect they trust you
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
every time they send their children into
 
02:45:04.610 --> 02:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
school to know that you will do the
 
02:45:07.130 --> 02:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
right thing that they will not be
 
02:45:10.130 --> 02:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
victims to senseless gun violence when
 
02:45:12.050 --> 02:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
they kiss their child in the morning and
 
02:45:13.969 --> 02:45:13.979 align:start position:0%
say goodbye to them
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is a law that we know the majority
 
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
of people support this is a law that has
 
02:45:23.090 --> 02:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
statistics behind it that shows it
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
produces homicide it reduces suicide it
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
reduces senseless killing and when we
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
talk about rights
 
02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
where are the people protecting the
 
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
rights of our children
 
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
the children who deserve a chance at
 
02:45:44.690 --> 02:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
Living of growing to their potential of
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
advocating for themselves
 
02:45:50.030 --> 02:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
they have been slaughtered we are
 
02:45:53.270 --> 02:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
watching them die in numbers that are
 
02:45:56.389 --> 02:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
beyond what other developed nations are
 
02:45:59.450 --> 02:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
witnessing and is because we do not have
 
02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
the courage
 
02:46:05.270 --> 02:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:08.570 --> 02:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
took this opportunity to the women who
 
02:46:10.370 --> 02:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
are at home with their children to speak
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
to you to look into your eyes I
 
02:46:16.130 --> 02:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
guarantee they would speak to you but
 
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have access to the
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come into this room like
 
02:46:22.429 --> 02:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
many others who you've heard from
 
02:46:25.070 --> 02:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to open this conversation
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
up to the mothers and the parents in
 
02:46:30.290 --> 02:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
this state and listen to them and
 
02:46:32.750 --> 02:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
possibly even listen to the children
 
02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and please
 
02:46:39.650 --> 02:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:41.929 --> 02:46:41.939 align:start position:0%
keep your testimony is there anyone who
 
02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
has not turned in the pink card yet to
 
02:46:45.170 --> 02:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
test it on this bill
 
02:46:47.090 --> 02:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
saying none I hear my clothes in public
 
02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on the hb59
 
02:46:52.969 --> 02:46:52.979 align:start position:0%
in openly public hearing on h376
 
02:46:52.979 --> 02:46:57.950 align:start position:0%
in openly public hearing on h376
oh

02:46:57.950 --> 02:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
I reopened the public hearing and please
 
02:47:02.929 --> 02:47:02.939 align:start position:0%
take the microphone
 
02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
um we don't we seem to have misplace the
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
card so I brought it in late it was
 
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
passed down so I'm sure it's somewhere
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm Joanna Brown from Manchester
 
02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
um I oppose this bill and I too have
 
02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
children and I would like you to all
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
think about what you don't hear on the
 
02:47:22.610 --> 02:47:22.620 align:start position:0%
news are the people the private citizens
 
02:47:25.849 --> 02:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
who are stopping gun violence by taking
 
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
out the aggressors you don't hear about
 
02:47:31.490 --> 02:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
in that in the news in a utopian society
 
02:47:35.690 --> 02:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
a three-day wait might be fine but a
 
02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:37.130 align:start position:0%
a three-day wait might be fine but a
woman

02:47:37.130 --> 02:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
woman
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
a restaurant waitress in Manchester
 
02:47:43.490 --> 02:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
received death threats from a homeless
 
02:47:43.500 --> 02:47:44.510 align:start position:0%
received death threats from a homeless
man

02:47:44.510 --> 02:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
man
 
02:47:47.929 --> 02:47:47.939 align:start position:0%
she doesn't have three days to wait
 
02:47:50.090 --> 02:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
three days is the difference between
 
02:47:53.090 --> 02:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
life and death for her women who've been
 
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
in abused relationships who are dealing
 
02:47:58.490 --> 02:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
with stalkers on the street they can't
 
02:48:01.250 --> 02:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
wait three days man
 
02:48:04.429 --> 02:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is about background checks the
 
02:48:06.170 --> 02:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
three-day waiting period bill is later
 
02:48:08.450 --> 02:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
although this does touch on it a little
 
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
bit but not really about what you're
 
02:48:11.929 --> 02:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
talking about so if you could just speak
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
to this bill regarding the background
 
02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
checks so this bill is the one about all
 
02:48:17.690 --> 02:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
the technical language and doing a
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
background check that takes three days
 
02:48:22.910 --> 02:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
IT addresses the part where if you have
 
02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
to wait three days you don't get an
 
02:48:25.790 --> 02:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
answer back
 
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
the law currently is that you can get
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
your firearm so it's it briefly touches
 
02:48:31.610 --> 02:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
that's all I had to say anyway okay
 
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:36.790 --> 02:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none hp59 is not closed HP 76 is
 
02:48:44.270 --> 02:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
open and the chair recognizes the prime
 
02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:48.010 align:start position:0%
open and the chair recognizes the prime
sponsor

02:48:48.010 --> 02:48:48.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:01.490 --> 02:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:05.230 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
Roy just to clarify I am not the prime
 
02:49:10.969 --> 02:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative cam Kenny is the
 
02:49:12.770 --> 02:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor but I think I can play one
 
02:49:14.170 --> 02:49:14.180 align:start position:0%
on TV
 
02:49:17.090 --> 02:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to try to do that I'm going
 
02:49:19.490 --> 02:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
to read representative Kenny's uh
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
statement and then I'll have some
 
02:49:23.090 --> 02:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
comments of my own
 
02:49:24.889 --> 02:49:24.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:49:27.469 --> 02:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
committee I apologize for not being able
 
02:49:30.490 --> 02:49:30.500 align:start position:0%
to be in person to introduce HB 76 today
 
02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm in my second year of
 
02:49:34.910 --> 02:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
law school and have class right now but
 
02:49:37.010 --> 02:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
please email me if you have any
 
02:49:37.020 --> 02:49:38.450 align:start position:0%
please email me if you have any
questions

02:49:38.450 --> 02:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:49:40.070 --> 02:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
to start with
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes a reasonable
 
02:49:44.270 --> 02:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
waiting period of three days before the
 
02:49:45.889 --> 02:49:45.899 align:start position:0%
delivery of a firearm
 
02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
this should not be a partisan issue as
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
both blue and red states such as Florida
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island and Illinois
 
02:49:55.550 --> 02:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
and others have passed some form of
 
02:49:57.170 --> 02:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
waiting period
 
02:49:59.570 --> 02:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
additionally waiting periods or cooling
 
02:50:01.730 --> 02:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
off periods have been shown to reduce
 
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
suicide and other forms of Violence by
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
offering time to gain perspective when
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
things in the moment might seem
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
intolerable or hopeless
 
02:50:13.309 --> 02:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
this bill gives a very reasonable window
 
02:50:15.650 --> 02:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
to increase the possibility of second
 
02:50:18.650 --> 02:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
thoughts and of getting help
 
02:50:20.809 --> 02:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
there are reasonable exceptions offered
 
02:50:22.730 --> 02:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
in part three of the bill which the
 
02:50:25.130 --> 02:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
chairman just just mentioned such as a
 
02:50:28.010 --> 02:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
16-hour hunting education course lawn
 
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
exemptions for law enforcement officers
 
02:50:32.750 --> 02:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
or active duty service members there are
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
also Provisions
 
02:50:40.190 --> 02:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
for exceptions for folks who have who
 
02:50:42.050 --> 02:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
basically are impacted by restraining
 
02:50:46.270 --> 02:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
orders or who have a reasonable fear
 
02:50:48.770 --> 02:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
of violence
 
02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is only intended to reduce
 
02:50:53.090 --> 02:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
impulsive acts by establishing a waiting
 
02:50:54.770 --> 02:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
period that has worked in other
 
02:50:57.349 --> 02:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and hopefully part three
 
02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
offers a fair balance that will narrowly
 
02:51:05.570 --> 02:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh narrowly confine the impact
 
02:51:08.750 --> 02:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
um what I wanted to add uh and I'm a
 
02:51:13.250 --> 02:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill is that HP 76
 
02:51:15.410 --> 02:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the enactment date
 
02:51:19.370 --> 02:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
is identical to HB 1101 that's a bill
 
02:51:21.950 --> 02:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
that passed in the Full House in 2020
 
02:51:23.570 --> 02:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
and was tabled in the Senate during
 
02:51:23.580 --> 02:51:25.250 align:start position:0%
and was tabled in the Senate during
cobit

02:51:25.250 --> 02:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
cobit
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
under current federal law there is no
 
02:51:30.530 --> 02:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
waiting period to purchase guns a
 
02:51:33.170 --> 02:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
waiting period uh can actually give law
 
02:51:35.690 --> 02:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement additional time to perform a
 
02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
background check and a cooling off
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
period uh in cases where people may be
 
02:51:44.510 --> 02:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
prone to violence or maybe maybe
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
considering a suicide attempt
 
02:51:50.090 --> 02:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to mention the fact that
 
02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
waiting periods are not an uncommon
 
02:51:55.550 --> 02:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
thing to encounter as a consumer in this
 
02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:56.650 align:start position:0%
thing to encounter as a consumer in this
state

02:51:56.650 --> 02:51:56.660 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:51:59.330 --> 02:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
anyone who's bought Dental or health
 
02:52:01.610 --> 02:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
insurance is familiar with waiting
 
02:52:04.190 --> 02:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
periods after you buy coverage we have
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
waiting periods for pet insurance we
 
02:52:09.410 --> 02:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
have waiting periods for divorces and
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
many employers also have a waiting
 
02:52:13.849 --> 02:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
period between the time you start work
 
02:52:16.670 --> 02:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
and when your employee benefits take
 
02:52:19.969 --> 02:52:19.979 align:start position:0%
effect we also have cooling off periods
 
02:52:23.389 --> 02:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
for many types of contracts where a
 
02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
person can can opt out of a contract
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
three days after signing it
 
02:52:31.610 --> 02:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I wanted to mention
 
02:52:33.889 --> 02:52:33.899 align:start position:0%
too is how frustrating it was for me
 
02:52:36.769 --> 02:52:36.779 align:start position:0%
during uh during covet when my oven went
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
out to have to wait uh for three months
 
02:52:40.969 --> 02:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
to it for a new oven to show up at my
 
02:52:43.610 --> 02:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
house uh that was a bummer we have lots
 
02:52:47.809 --> 02:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
of microwaved meals very inconvenient
 
02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and and I think the key point of that
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
all of us are adults and we're used to
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
waiting some sometimes sometimes we just
 
02:53:00.110 --> 02:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the fact that some of
 
02:53:01.790 --> 02:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
the things we would really like to have
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
now we just simply have to wait for uh
 
02:53:08.330 --> 02:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to make that point
 
02:53:10.849 --> 02:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
um the other point that I wanted to to
 
02:53:14.570 --> 02:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
make also is that uh this bill probably
 
02:53:16.370 --> 02:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
more than some of the others that we're
 
02:53:18.170 --> 02:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
going to hear today
 
02:53:20.030 --> 02:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
um has the potential to significantly
 
02:53:22.010 --> 02:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
impact suicides
 
02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
so in in New Hampshire I would be the
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
first to say we have much less of a of a
 
02:53:31.730 --> 02:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
gun homicide problem than we do a gun
 
02:53:35.030 --> 02:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
suicide problem in 2020 which is the
 
02:53:38.349 --> 02:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
last year that I could find 118 out of
 
02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
129 firearm debts were suicide that's
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
about 91 of the deaths by firearm during
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
that year and that's from the chief
 
02:53:49.309 --> 02:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
medical examiner
 
02:53:53.450 --> 02:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh from 2015 to 2019 suicide was also
 
02:53:55.910 --> 02:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
the second leading cause uh in the
 
02:53:58.370 --> 02:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
granite state between people between the
 
02:54:02.929 --> 02:54:02.939 align:start position:0%
age of 10 and 34. uh and meanwhile I
 
02:54:04.309 --> 02:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
think one of the things you have to
 
02:54:07.130 --> 02:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
consider is that uh
 
02:54:10.370 --> 02:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
death from Firearms Remains the most
 
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
lethal type of suicide uh about 90
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
percent of the people who try it
 
02:54:19.269 --> 02:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately are successful
 
02:54:21.950 --> 02:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things we hear a lot is that
 
02:54:24.530 --> 02:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
well gee I could take a screwdriver and
 
02:54:26.570 --> 02:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
I could commit suicide with that I could
 
02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
I could drink too much water and commit
 
02:54:32.210 --> 02:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
suicide that way the point is is all you
 
02:54:35.690 --> 02:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
have to do with a gun is pointed at your
 
02:54:37.849 --> 02:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
head pull the trigger and ninety percent
 
02:54:42.050 --> 02:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
of the time it's Lights Out it's over
 
02:54:43.550 --> 02:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
um in addition to establishing the
 
02:54:45.730 --> 02:54:45.740 align:start position:0%
three-day waiting period
 
02:54:48.410 --> 02:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
the bill does offer some common sense
 
02:54:51.410 --> 02:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
exemptions and those exemptions and we
 
02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the one for people who've
 
02:54:56.389 --> 02:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
completed uh 100 safety courses there
 
02:54:58.490 --> 02:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
are also exemptions that address issues
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh by victims of domestic violence or
 
02:55:03.170 --> 02:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
people who have had their personal
 
02:55:06.769 --> 02:55:06.779 align:start position:0%
safety threatened in cases where your
 
02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
you feel your personal safety is
 
02:55:08.700 --> 02:55:10.250 align:start position:0%
you feel your personal safety is
threatened

02:55:10.250 --> 02:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
threatened
 
02:55:13.370 --> 02:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and uh you uh and you've expressed
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
fear for your personal safety to a law
 
02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer the three-day
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
waiting period could be waived not to
 
02:55:24.230 --> 02:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
say that it's not a terrible idea giving
 
02:55:26.929 --> 02:55:26.939 align:start position:0%
a firearm to an untrained person there's
 
02:55:30.530 --> 02:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
also some significant risk there but the
 
02:55:32.450 --> 02:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
bottom line is this was one of the main
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
objections that came up the last time
 
02:55:36.830 --> 02:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill was filed
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh and it was amended to address
 
02:55:42.610 --> 02:55:42.620 align:start position:0%
the subject objection and essentially
 
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's the bill that's before us today
 
02:55:48.530 --> 02:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
so what I would ask you is uh please
 
02:55:51.290 --> 02:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
give it your strong consideration uh
 
02:55:53.630 --> 02:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
waiting periods are not unusual they're
 
02:55:56.450 --> 02:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
not a tragedy in in the case of a
 
02:56:00.110 --> 02:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
firearm or suicide or exit violence is a
 
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
real risk it's one more thing that we
 
02:56:06.110 --> 02:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
can do not necessarily to completely
 
02:56:09.650 --> 02:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
prevent gun violence but it's part of
 
02:56:12.050 --> 02:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
the picture of reducing the risk of gun
 
02:56:14.090 --> 02:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
violence and I think that's that's
 
02:56:16.309 --> 02:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
something that um whether you're a gun
 
02:56:19.250 --> 02:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
owner whether you're gun violence
 
02:56:21.230 --> 02:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
prevention Advocate I think that's
 
02:56:23.870 --> 02:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
something we also be able to to support
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully so please give it your strong
 
02:56:28.929 --> 02:56:28.939 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you
 
02:56:31.870 --> 02:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
02:56:38.389 --> 02:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:43.490 --> 02:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:45.530 --> 02:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and find committee
 
02:56:48.170 --> 02:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
members I am former representative John
 
02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:49.550 align:start position:0%
members I am former representative John
Burt

02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
Burt
 
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
for 12 years I represented Goffstown
 
02:56:54.590 --> 02:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
where in Darren
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
02:57:00.050 --> 02:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
we don't need this
 
02:57:02.510 --> 02:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to tell you why
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of the safest
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
states in the nation
 
02:57:10.730 --> 02:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
you know this is just going to mess it
 
02:57:10.740 --> 02:57:12.710 align:start position:0%
you know this is just going to mess it
up

02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:57:16.010 --> 02:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
I look at the men and I do say men and
 
02:57:19.610 --> 02:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
women that are abused in this state
 
02:57:21.769 --> 02:57:21.779 align:start position:0%
and occasionally some of those men and
 
02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
women want to protect themselves from
 
02:57:25.370 --> 02:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
their abuser
 
02:57:27.950 --> 02:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
and they purchase a firearm they don't
 
02:57:30.290 --> 02:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
want to wait the three days
 
02:57:33.230 --> 02:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
because as
 
02:57:36.590 --> 02:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen it takes a half hour 10
 
02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:37.610 align:start position:0%
we've seen it takes a half hour 10
minutes

02:57:37.610 --> 02:57:37.620 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:57:40.370 --> 02:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
even two minutes for a police officer to
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
show up
 
02:57:43.429 --> 02:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's too long
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:48.769 --> 02:57:48.779 align:start position:0%
and again that we are this at one of the
 
02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
safest states in the nation occasionally
 
02:57:52.190 --> 02:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
we're number one occasionally we're
 
02:57:54.830 --> 02:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
number two or three it's always within
 
02:57:57.410 --> 02:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
those ranges we're even safer than
 
02:57:57.420 --> 02:57:59.090 align:start position:0%
those ranges we're even safer than
Canada

02:57:59.090 --> 02:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
Canada
 
02:58:02.090 --> 02:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
and look what Trudeau is doing up there
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
he has taken guns
 
02:58:07.429 --> 02:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
in their crime rates are increasing
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:13.610 --> 02:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman
 
02:58:17.210 --> 02:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
I do want to point out one last thing
 
02:58:19.429 --> 02:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
the fine representative that spoke last
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
said that there is a three-day waiting
 
02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
period in Massachusetts
 
02:58:26.330 --> 02:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
there is no waiting period in
 
02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:28.610 align:start position:0%
there is no waiting period in
Massachusetts

02:58:28.610 --> 02:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:30.830 --> 02:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
you walk in
 
02:58:33.230 --> 02:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
if you're not a prohibited person you
 
02:58:36.590 --> 02:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
walk out with that firearm that minute
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
so I you know you just look at this bill
 
02:58:41.870 --> 02:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's bad so please oppose this Bill
 
02:58:44.269 --> 02:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony chair
 
02:58:49.790 --> 02:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:54.950 --> 02:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:56.450 --> 02:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh good morning for the next two minutes
 
02:58:59.090 --> 02:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
I guess still morning uh johannan Gunner
 
02:59:01.190 --> 02:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
Rose of New Hampshire uh we're obviously
 
02:59:04.610 --> 02:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill again
 
02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
um you know there are exceptions in this
 
02:59:08.210 --> 02:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
bill which I'll I'll give credit where
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
credit is due we usually don't see this
 
02:59:12.769 --> 02:59:12.779 align:start position:0%
many exceptions but uh they're not
 
02:59:15.889 --> 02:59:15.899 align:start position:0%
they're not anything that um would would
 
02:59:17.210 --> 02:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
make us feel more comfortable with
 
02:59:19.010 --> 02:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill at all
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
um you know allowing exceptions for uh
 
02:59:22.670 --> 02:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
law enforce you know expressing to a law
 
02:59:24.050 --> 02:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer for a reasonable
 
02:59:26.330 --> 02:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
fear of his or her own safety sounds
 
02:59:28.910 --> 02:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable unless you're married to a
 
02:59:30.290 --> 02:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer who is abusing
 
02:59:31.730 --> 02:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
you and that's why you need the firearm
 
02:59:33.050 --> 02:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
now their buddies know and that's the
 
02:59:35.570 --> 02:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
only way you can get it otherwise
 
02:59:37.610 --> 02:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
um that's just one example
 
02:59:40.130 --> 02:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
um you're allowed to get it if you trade
 
02:59:42.650 --> 02:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
in a firearm sounds great because you've
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
already got a gun but you know
 
02:59:46.190 --> 02:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
what if you already have a gun do you
 
02:59:47.630 --> 02:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
have to trade it in what if I already
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
have one and show them I already own a
 
02:59:51.050 --> 02:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
firearm so there's no exceptions for
 
02:59:52.490 --> 02:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
someone who already has a gun that has
 
02:59:54.290 --> 02:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
the means to do whatever with that
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
firearm that's not an exception
 
02:59:56.640 --> 02:59:57.349 align:start position:0%
firearm that's not an exception
um

02:59:57.349 --> 02:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:59.030 --> 02:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to improve the bill I'm
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
just trying to tell you that there are a
 
03:00:02.030 --> 03:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
lot of things wrong with the way it is
 
03:00:02.040 --> 03:00:03.650 align:start position:0%
lot of things wrong with the way it is
written

03:00:03.650 --> 03:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:00:05.570 --> 03:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
um you know if someone can purchase a
 
03:00:08.269 --> 03:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
rifle or a shotgun and for one thing if
 
03:00:09.769 --> 03:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
the purpose is to reduce suicides there
 
03:00:10.610 --> 03:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
are two things that are not
 
03:00:12.530 --> 03:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
predominantly used in suicides but they
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
can I'm not I'll say they can be but if
 
03:00:17.330 --> 03:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
a person completes a 16 hour Hunter
 
03:00:18.590 --> 03:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
education course offered by the
 
03:00:20.929 --> 03:00:20.939 align:start position:0%
department of fishing game uh you can
 
03:00:22.550 --> 03:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
take that as young as age 12 obviously
 
03:00:23.690 --> 03:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
you have to be older to purchase a
 
03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
firearm but all they have to do is take
 
03:00:27.230 --> 03:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
a course so we're assuming by this that
 
03:00:29.210 --> 03:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
if suicide prevention is the goal that
 
03:00:30.830 --> 03:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
people that are trained in the hunter
 
03:00:32.030 --> 03:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
safety course are not going to be
 
03:00:33.950 --> 03:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
suicidal so there's a lot of exceptions
 
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
to make people happy but I don't know if
 
03:00:37.250 --> 03:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's doing what people expect it to do
 
03:00:40.250 --> 03:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
and also the data shows that most
 
03:00:42.590 --> 03:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
suicides that occur with the use of a
 
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
firearm although more successful with
 
03:00:46.550 --> 03:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
the firearm obviously it is effective
 
03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately most of them occur after a
 
03:00:51.530 --> 03:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
year after purchase and even with 10-day
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
waiting periods there's still a very
 
03:00:55.790 --> 03:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
significant increase in suicides in the
 
03:00:57.830 --> 03:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
shorter period even after a 10-day
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
waiting periods so having a shorter
 
03:01:01.309 --> 03:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
waiting period if someone's intent on
 
03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
doing it you know it's not something
 
03:01:05.450 --> 03:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
that's going to be statistically
 
03:01:07.550 --> 03:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
significant to stop what the intended
 
03:01:09.830 --> 03:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
goal may or may not be
 
03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:10.849 align:start position:0%
goal may or may not be
um

03:01:10.849 --> 03:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's more that can be said but we've
 
03:01:15.170 --> 03:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
heard this so many times uh you know a
 
03:01:16.849 --> 03:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
right delayed is a right denied is
 
03:01:18.650 --> 03:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
something that was uh said I forget I
 
03:01:19.849 --> 03:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
don't remember Supreme Court Justice
 
03:01:22.610 --> 03:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
sorry but uh it's it's very true in this
 
03:01:24.650 --> 03:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
case we don't expect people to wait to
 
03:01:26.150 --> 03:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
post something online or social media
 
03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
although it's probably a good idea for
 
03:01:30.110 --> 03:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
some people uh you know we don't expect
 
03:01:31.910 --> 03:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
people to in New Hampshire to wait to
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
vote you can do same-day voting
 
03:01:36.530 --> 03:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
um they're making an exception for this
 
03:01:39.410 --> 03:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
which is is not right uh if you're
 
03:01:41.030 --> 03:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
allowing exception for what for to
 
03:01:44.330 --> 03:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
exercise a right not a privilege
 
03:01:46.190 --> 03:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
um that's that's a very bad precedent to
 
03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
set in New Hampshire thank you
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very testimony chair
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
recognized Joanne Brown
 
03:02:00.550 --> 03:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:07.969 --> 03:02:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:15.349 --> 03:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
hey thank you for uh let me publicly
 
03:02:16.790 --> 03:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
speak so I noticed there are some
 
03:02:19.250 --> 03:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
semantic issues here uh it mentions uh
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
in order to skip the uh time to pretend
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
that delaying is an imprinting rights
 
03:02:25.250 --> 03:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
for a second I'm expressing to the law
 
03:02:26.630 --> 03:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer reasonable fear for
 
03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
his our own personal safety
 
03:02:30.290 --> 03:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
um well expression can mean multiple
 
03:02:32.450 --> 03:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
things like maybe buying favors or
 
03:02:34.610 --> 03:02:34.620 align:start position:0%
giving them something and it's not
 
03:02:38.030 --> 03:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
particularly up uh a pursuing citizen
 
03:02:40.070 --> 03:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
thing to do but it is possible according
 
03:02:41.630 --> 03:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
to here
 
03:02:43.130 --> 03:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I know there's a concealed carry
 
03:02:44.750 --> 03:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
permit which could be in essence the
 
03:02:45.950 --> 03:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
same thing but it doesn't include open
 
03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
carry so that this doesn't really
 
03:02:49.190 --> 03:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
include that
 
03:02:51.950 --> 03:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
um and then just more in general
 
03:02:51.960 --> 03:02:53.210 align:start position:0%
um and then just more in general
speaking

03:02:53.210 --> 03:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
03:02:54.950 --> 03:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
um not just fire and still if you had to
 
03:02:57.290 --> 03:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
wait to buy a car or even worse you know
 
03:02:58.969 --> 03:02:58.979 align:start position:0%
like you have a kid but you have to wait
 
03:03:00.410 --> 03:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
three days to take the kid home like
 
03:03:02.630 --> 03:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's silly right so applying to farm
 
03:03:05.570 --> 03:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
is the same way why would you add an
 
03:03:07.730 --> 03:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
arbitrary delay to an item that you will
 
03:03:09.889 --> 03:03:09.899 align:start position:0%
awfully you know that's all I want to
 
03:03:12.050 --> 03:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
say thank you
 
03:03:15.530 --> 03:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
chair calls Leonard Cohen Dr Leonard
 
03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:25.309 align:start position:0%
chair calls Leonard Cohen Dr Leonard
Cohen

03:03:25.309 --> 03:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:28.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
as

03:03:28.870 --> 03:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:03:33.590 --> 03:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
as a psychiatrist we know that suicide
 
03:03:37.130 --> 03:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
is a very impulsive Act
 
03:03:42.610 --> 03:03:42.620 align:start position:0%
and often the impulse to kill
 
03:03:45.910 --> 03:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
subsides over hours
 
03:03:49.309 --> 03:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh let alone a couple of days
 
03:03:53.389 --> 03:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
this bill is an attempt to interfere
 
03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
with the impulsive Act
 
03:03:58.870 --> 03:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
that somebody
 
03:04:04.190 --> 03:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
who is thinking about suicide might go
 
03:04:07.610 --> 03:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
get a gun and act on it right away
 
03:04:11.570 --> 03:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
so this is an attempt to interfere with
 
03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
that impulsive act and we think it would
 
03:04:16.010 --> 03:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
be one
 
03:04:16.020 --> 03:04:18.590 align:start position:0%
be one
important

03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:04:24.530 --> 03:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
step in uh trying to reduce gun violence
 
03:04:25.969 --> 03:04:25.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:04:29.469 --> 03:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:50.750 --> 03:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
I apologize if you're going to get sick
 
03:04:55.130 --> 03:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:59.389 --> 03:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
I ask you to ATL this bill in response
 
03:05:03.290 --> 03:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
to house bill 76.
 
03:05:07.090 --> 03:05:07.100 align:start position:0%
this bill is in conflict with ATF Form
 
03:05:07.100 --> 03:05:09.370 align:start position:0%

5300.9 revised December of 22.
 
03:05:16.969 --> 03:05:16.979 align:start position:0%
specifically the proposed Bill states
 
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
there is no waiting period for a person
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
who has obtained a restraining order
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
from a court under circumstances where
 
03:05:26.809 --> 03:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
the person feared for his or her safety
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
or expresses to a law enforcement
 
03:05:33.769 --> 03:05:33.779 align:start position:0%
officer a reasonable fear for his or her
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
own personal safety reasonable is very
 
03:05:37.200 --> 03:05:38.830 align:start position:0%
own personal safety reasonable is very
subjective

03:05:38.830 --> 03:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
03:05:43.969 --> 03:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
the 4473 Nix Check May delay anyone who

03:05:52.429 --> 03:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
I will not be made a felon by this bill
 
03:05:55.550 --> 03:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
if I am told by a police officer to sell
 
03:05:57.950 --> 03:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
someone a firearm prior to this bill's
 
03:06:00.650 --> 03:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
three-day wait period if the ATF can
 
03:06:06.410 --> 03:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:08.809 --> 03:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
I will not be told by a police officer
 
03:06:11.330 --> 03:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
to break the ATF rules based on the
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
proposed bill in there
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
thought of what is reasonable
 
03:06:20.690 --> 03:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
I also find The Spill hypocritical that
 
03:06:22.730 --> 03:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
someone may buy a shotgun or rifle
 
03:06:25.010 --> 03:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
instantly merely due to holding a
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
hunting license
 
03:06:26.399 --> 03:06:27.769 align:start position:0%
hunting license
which

03:06:27.769 --> 03:06:27.779 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:06:29.389 --> 03:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on New Hampshire
 
03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
hunting licenses so I don't know how
 
03:06:34.730 --> 03:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
easily they can be forged
 
03:06:36.889 --> 03:06:36.899 align:start position:0%
I answer to the ATM
 
03:06:40.490 --> 03:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
not to a local police officer if the ATF
 
03:06:44.690 --> 03:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
has up until 10 days to wait
 
03:06:47.450 --> 03:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
I refuse to be a felon because a police
 
03:06:49.070 --> 03:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
officer says
 
03:06:51.469 --> 03:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
he wants somebody to have a gun
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:03.410 --> 03:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
what if a police officer's friend
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to wait three days and has
 
03:07:08.170 --> 03:07:08.180 align:start position:0%
them tell me not to wait three days
 
03:07:10.849 --> 03:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
based on their reasonable
 
03:07:13.849 --> 03:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
thought of fear
 
03:07:17.570 --> 03:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
this is Rife for abuse with the ffls
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
being on the hook
 
03:07:22.670 --> 03:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
further I don't need to be told by the
 
03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
authors to make my records available to
 
03:07:27.650 --> 03:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
the ATF when that is already an ATF
 
03:07:30.769 --> 03:07:30.779 align:start position:0%
regulation for licensure
 
03:07:33.650 --> 03:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
if I refuse to comply with an illegal
 
03:07:37.250 --> 03:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:39.230 --> 03:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
the authors may want to have an attorney
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
look over the proposed bill as it is
 
03:07:44.809 --> 03:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
clear they do not know what they are
 
03:07:44.819 --> 03:07:45.590 align:start position:0%
clear they do not know what they are
doing

03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:07:47.690 --> 03:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:07:51.050 --> 03:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony chair calls
 
03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
time representative Tom mannion
 
03:08:06.710 --> 03:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of committee
 
03:08:10.730 --> 03:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
my name is Tom minion I represent
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro One Pelham I'm here to speak
 
03:08:14.929 --> 03:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
against hb76
 
03:08:17.269 --> 03:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
during the summer of 2020 I watched live
 
03:08:19.130 --> 03:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
streams of fiery but mostly peaceful
 
03:08:21.650 --> 03:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
protests across the country the citizens
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
were angry and I agreed with their anger
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
but not the methodology private
 
03:08:27.650 --> 03:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
businesses even those with black owners
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
were torched and some of the largest
 
03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
cities with more violent protests
 
03:08:32.750 --> 03:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
terrified business owners were told by
 
03:08:34.190 --> 03:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
911 dispatchers the police were
 
03:08:37.849 --> 03:08:37.859 align:start position:0%
unavailable and help unavailable to help
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
and they were on their own hearing this
 
03:08:41.389 --> 03:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
I was thankful we live in a country
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
where we can arm ourselves against such
 
03:08:45.230 --> 03:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
violence but in states with firearm
 
03:08:46.730 --> 03:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
waiting periods like California you
 
03:08:48.769 --> 03:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
cannot just go get a firearm to protect
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
your business your family your property
 
03:08:52.910 --> 03:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
these people learn the hard way that
 
03:08:54.349 --> 03:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
they're feel good sensible gun control
 
03:08:57.530 --> 03:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
measures would have costly consequences
 
03:08:59.690 --> 03:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
a compacting criminally halfway across
 
03:09:02.090 --> 03:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
the country country away
 
03:09:03.889 --> 03:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
uh would result in near overnight
 
03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
reaction from a rightfully angry
 
03:09:07.610 --> 03:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
Community but would end up destroying
 
03:09:09.710 --> 03:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
the livelihood or homes of people wholly
 
03:09:12.050 --> 03:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
and uninvolved
 
03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
and they were told by both the police
 
03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the gun store owners you're going to
 
03:09:17.630 --> 03:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
have to wait
 
03:09:18.889 --> 03:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
it's easy to be a money money
 
03:09:20.750 --> 03:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
quarterback and say they should have
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
already had the gun
 
03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
but the same people pushing for winning
 
03:09:25.190 --> 03:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
periods don't actually believe this
 
03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:26.690 align:start position:0%
periods don't actually believe this
either

03:09:26.690 --> 03:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:09:28.490 --> 03:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
they'd rather you be disarmed and hope
 
03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
the waiting period is enough to do
 
03:09:32.090 --> 03:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
enough of a deterrent to keep you from
 
03:09:34.610 --> 03:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
bothering at all they believe a waiting
 
03:09:36.110 --> 03:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
period would stop some Heat of the
 
03:09:37.910 --> 03:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
Moment gun purchase for a vigilante
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
looking for vengeance or whatever
 
03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
thriller movie scenario they have cooked
 
03:09:44.090 --> 03:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
up that same person will just get it
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
illegally should a waiting period be
 
03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:46.910 align:start position:0%
illegally should a waiting period be
introduced

03:09:46.910 --> 03:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
the only person the only people being
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
affected by this are those that wish to
 
03:09:52.730 --> 03:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
remain within the law and will
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately be harmed by it
 
03:09:56.690 --> 03:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
if another Country-Wide protest is on
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
the horizon and your state has a
 
03:10:00.230 --> 03:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory waiting period you may as well
 
03:10:01.910 --> 03:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
pack your things and leave town just
 
03:10:03.290 --> 03:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
don't expect your home to be there when
 
03:10:05.090 --> 03:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
you get back I asked the committee to
 
03:10:07.250 --> 03:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
itl HP 76 and I'm willing to take any
 
03:10:07.260 --> 03:10:09.550 align:start position:0%
itl HP 76 and I'm willing to take any
questions

03:10:09.550 --> 03:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:10:18.830 --> 03:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:27.849 --> 03:10:27.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:32.090 --> 03:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.309 --> 03:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:10:35.929 --> 03:10:35.939 align:start position:0%
again thank you for your time citizens
 
03:10:38.690 --> 03:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
and representatives we appreciate it
 
03:10:41.809 --> 03:10:41.819 align:start position:0%
uh suicide yep serious
 
03:10:45.769 --> 03:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
does help 988 is a good number to keep
 
03:10:48.650 --> 03:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
in mind if someone that you know
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
or yourself maybe looking to hurt
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
yourself or listen to stress
 
03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay we get that out of the way
 
03:10:58.849 --> 03:10:58.859 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna oppose the three-day waiting
 
03:11:00.110 --> 03:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
period that we're talking about right
 
03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:01.010 align:start position:0%
period that we're talking about right
now

03:11:01.010 --> 03:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna touch on the Federal
 
03:11:08.570 --> 03:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
Constitution for a minute if I may
 
03:11:12.110 --> 03:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
amendment 14 in particular
 
03:11:14.750 --> 03:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
all persons born on naturalized in the
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
United States and subject to the
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the
 
03:11:21.290 --> 03:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
United States another state wherein they
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
reside no State shall make or enforce
 
03:11:27.769 --> 03:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
any law would show abridge the
 
03:11:29.929 --> 03:11:29.939 align:start position:0%
Privileges or immunities of citizens of
 
03:11:33.170 --> 03:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
the United States nor show any state of
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
Pride any person of life liberty or
 
03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
property well due process of law nor
 
03:11:43.010 --> 03:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
deny any person within its jurisdiction
 
03:11:48.710 --> 03:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
to the equal protection of the laws
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
yet we have a number of exceptions
 
03:11:53.450 --> 03:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
in our three-day waiting period that you
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
propose them
 
03:11:57.230 --> 03:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
why their exceptions for certain people
 
03:11:58.670 --> 03:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
in Norfolk
 
03:12:01.010 --> 03:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
just let it go if I pass it background
 
03:12:04.490 --> 03:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
check if she passes the background check
 
03:12:06.410 --> 03:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
that part of the equation has been done
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's resolved they pass let them have
 
03:12:11.330 --> 03:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
they've gotten
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
I've seen domestic violence
 
03:12:15.410 --> 03:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
up close and personal as a law
 
03:12:17.330 --> 03:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and past life
 
03:12:19.670 --> 03:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's ugly
 
03:12:22.370 --> 03:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
it's very ugly
 
03:12:25.010 --> 03:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
I wish it upon nobody
 
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone should ever see it
 
03:12:28.319 --> 03:12:29.510 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone should ever see it
but

03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:12:33.530 --> 03:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:35.809 --> 03:12:35.819 align:start position:0%
and enough's enough
 
03:12:38.210 --> 03:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
and the police come and take away the
 
03:12:38.220 --> 03:12:39.110 align:start position:0%
and the police come and take away the
husband

03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
husband
 
03:12:42.370 --> 03:12:42.380 align:start position:0%
and his last words I'm gonna
 
03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
explicatively kill you
 
03:12:47.090 --> 03:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
he means it
 
03:12:52.250 --> 03:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:54.830 --> 03:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
that woman needs something to defend
 
03:12:56.690 --> 03:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
herself with right now
 
03:12:58.010 --> 03:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
she doesn't
 
03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
have to buy a gun she can go and run to
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
her her mother's Place Father's Place
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
cousin's place sure
 
03:13:06.889 --> 03:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
but she could buy a gun if she wanted to
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
if she's in that much fear of her life
 
03:13:11.809 --> 03:13:11.819 align:start position:0%
and leave with it that day
 
03:13:13.969 --> 03:13:13.979 align:start position:0%
If This Were to be implemented there is
 
03:13:15.410 --> 03:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
some conflict with federal law which was
 
03:13:16.429 --> 03:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
touched on
 
03:13:19.490 --> 03:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
between 18 years of age and 21 is a
 
03:13:21.230 --> 03:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
10-day waiting period now it was in
 
03:13:23.090 --> 03:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
response to a lot of young shooters that
 
03:13:25.550 --> 03:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
were shooting up in schools and Walmarts
 
03:13:27.710 --> 03:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
and stuff so that's already in Conflict
 
03:13:27.720 --> 03:13:29.830 align:start position:0%
and stuff so that's already in Conflict
there

03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:13:33.469 --> 03:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
if I get a delay from the gum line
 
03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
saying there's a delay as a pending it
 
03:13:37.309 --> 03:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
was the actual language used
 
03:13:41.330 --> 03:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
pending p50s and then five numbers
 
03:13:44.269 --> 03:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to violate awe and be held
 
03:13:47.269 --> 03:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
accountable because somebody's going to
 
03:13:50.269 --> 03:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
tell me yeah you can do it
 
03:13:52.429 --> 03:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
if that gun's used incorrectly who's on
 
03:13:54.410 --> 03:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
the hook for that do you also told me to
 
03:13:57.230 --> 03:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
do it on me I'm unhooky either way I'm a
 
03:13:58.849 --> 03:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
gun store on the bad guy
 
03:14:01.309 --> 03:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
I understand that I try to do good
 
03:14:01.319 --> 03:14:02.809 align:start position:0%
I understand that I try to do good
though

03:14:02.809 --> 03:14:02.819 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:14:06.889 --> 03:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
but let's say for the sake of argument
 
03:14:09.050 --> 03:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
that this takes effect it's really
 
03:14:11.389 --> 03:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
waiting period and that person who's
 
03:14:13.370 --> 03:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
been abused or broke the cycle
 
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
can't get a restraining order right now
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason they come to me
 
03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:17.990 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason they come to me
first

03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:14:21.769 --> 03:14:21.779 align:start position:0%
oh I closed my doors early coming sick
 
03:14:23.870 --> 03:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if my cousin who has a
 
03:14:25.730 --> 03:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
gun could give it to me
 
03:14:27.769 --> 03:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
well 59
 
03:14:31.010 --> 03:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
prevent that wouldn't it
 
03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
so now we've just
 
03:14:36.170 --> 03:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
helped along a victim become more a
 
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
victim with both sets of these proposed
 
03:14:38.880 --> 03:14:44.150 align:start position:0%
victim with both sets of these proposed
laws

03:14:44.150 --> 03:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:45.889 --> 03:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
I hope
 
03:14:47.450 --> 03:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony that is being
 
03:14:49.610 --> 03:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
given here makes sense
 
03:14:51.410 --> 03:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
and gives you a different perspective on
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
how to look at things
 
03:14:55.610 --> 03:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
again I don't believe anybody here
 
03:14:57.410 --> 03:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
is doing this
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
other than from the heart and what they
 
03:15:00.830 --> 03:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
believe because they want people to be
 
03:15:02.990 --> 03:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
safe they don't want people to get hurt
 
03:15:05.330 --> 03:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
I think we all agree in that
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
there's different ways of
 
03:15:10.010 --> 03:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
preventing from becoming a victim
 
03:15:12.469 --> 03:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
different ways of responding to a
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
violent situation
 
03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:16.670 align:start position:0%
violent situation
but

03:15:16.670 --> 03:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:15:19.370 --> 03:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
I respectfully ask you that's not
 
03:15:19.380 --> 03:15:21.230 align:start position:0%
I respectfully ask you that's not
penalized

03:15:21.230 --> 03:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
penalized
 
03:15:23.330 --> 03:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
the citizens who wish to exercise our
 
03:15:25.130 --> 03:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
rights the way they want to the way
 
03:15:26.809 --> 03:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
we've been doing
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years as a republic
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
let's not start making exceptions
 
03:15:33.950 --> 03:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's not rule of law
 
03:15:36.110 --> 03:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
then we stop putting certain people in
 
03:15:38.210 --> 03:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
certain classes oh
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
the trooper can have a gun you gotta
 
03:15:40.319 --> 03:15:41.030 align:start position:0%
the trooper can have a gun you gotta
wait

03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
wait
 
03:15:43.550 --> 03:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
he already has a gun man State gave it
 
03:15:46.790 --> 03:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
to him we paid for it he's all set
 
03:15:48.410 --> 03:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
and as in the other example what about
 
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
what if his wife was the abused victim
 
03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:52.190 align:start position:0%
what if his wife was the abused victim
here

03:15:52.190 --> 03:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:15:53.690 --> 03:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
she needs something to defend herself
 
03:15:55.370 --> 03:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
he's trained
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
and as it was pointed out by some other
 
03:16:01.130 --> 03:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
female colleagues here stature
 
03:16:04.730 --> 03:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
look at me five foot nine to eight
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
where's Kim
 
03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's morbid I understand that
 
03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
but it's real
 
03:16:18.830 --> 03:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
03:16:21.050 --> 03:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:16:24.110 --> 03:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
share calls and Je Simpkins
 
03:16:28.870 --> 03:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman of members of
 
03:16:33.410 --> 03:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for this
 
03:16:35.690 --> 03:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
 
03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be a little briefer than
 
03:16:40.490 --> 03:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
I've been
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
anyone who uses the term gun violence
 
03:16:49.070 --> 03:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
end quote seeks to mislead homicide is a
 
03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:50.090 align:start position:0%
end quote seeks to mislead homicide is a
crime

03:16:50.090 --> 03:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
crime
 
03:16:52.190 --> 03:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
suicide is not
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
both are very sad but these are
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different events that
 
03:16:59.929 --> 03:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
should not be lumped together the doing
 
03:17:04.429 --> 03:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
so is to my mind this speaks a certain
 
03:17:08.210 --> 03:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
element of intellectual dishonesty now
 
03:17:10.250 --> 03:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and for the members of
 
03:17:15.490 --> 03:17:15.500 align:start position:0%
the committee I may labor the obvious
 
03:17:19.730 --> 03:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
murders are so infrequent that all are
 
03:17:21.889 --> 03:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by
 
03:17:24.230 --> 03:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
an assistant to the Attorney General of
 
03:17:25.370 --> 03:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:17:27.969 --> 03:17:27.979 align:start position:0%
I presume I do not know this for sure
 
03:17:31.610 --> 03:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
that County Prosecutors don't see enough
 
03:17:34.730 --> 03:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
murders to become Adept at this type of
 
03:17:34.740 --> 03:17:36.650 align:start position:0%
murders to become Adept at this type of
prosecution

03:17:36.650 --> 03:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
03:17:40.030 --> 03:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
the murder rate in New Hampshire
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
typically is about one per hundred
 
03:17:48.290 --> 03:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
thousand which is about the same as in
 
03:17:51.010 --> 03:17:51.020 align:start position:0%
quote civilized countries in Europe
 
03:17:53.530 --> 03:17:53.540 align:start position:0%
occasionally it will pop above
 
03:17:57.790 --> 03:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:02.570 --> 03:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
whereas the murder rate in the nation at
 
03:18:05.389 --> 03:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
large is usually five per hundred
 
03:18:07.309 --> 03:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
thousand or more
 
03:18:10.610 --> 03:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
so again we appear to be a very
 
03:18:13.250 --> 03:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
law-abiding state that would not
 
03:18:15.769 --> 03:18:15.779 align:start position:0%
therefore appear to be
 
03:18:20.690 --> 03:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
any matter any reason having to do with
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
prevention of crime for a waiting period
 
03:18:27.530 --> 03:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:30.290 --> 03:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
for I mean I can explain if anyone wants
 
03:18:33.710 --> 03:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
to ask a question why the incidence of
 
03:18:36.170 --> 03:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
violent crime in New Hampshire
 
03:18:39.230 --> 03:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
is so much lower than it is in
 
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts our neighbor to the South
 
03:18:46.130 --> 03:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
but only take your time if you wish
 
03:18:49.490 --> 03:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
as do other civilized countries and I
 
03:18:51.469 --> 03:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
put that term civilized countries and
 
03:18:51.479 --> 03:18:54.349 align:start position:0%
put that term civilized countries and
quotes

03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.650 --> 03:18:59.660 align:start position:0%
those who use or cite those statistics
 
03:18:59.660 --> 03:19:01.490 align:start position:0%
those who use or cite those statistics
disregard

03:19:01.490 --> 03:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
disregard
 
03:19:04.130 --> 03:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
the number of residents of those
 
03:19:04.140 --> 03:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
the number of residents of those
countries

03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
countries
 
03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
who for example were murdered by the
 
03:19:13.610 --> 03:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
Nazis victims of genocide aren't counted
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
the biggest murderer in the century just
 
03:19:20.690 --> 03:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
closed the 20th century were not
 
03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
criminals either
 
03:19:26.269 --> 03:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
common or organized the biggest
 
03:19:26.279 --> 03:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
common or organized the biggest
murderers

03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
murderers
 
03:19:30.769 --> 03:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
in the century just closed were
 
03:19:33.530 --> 03:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
officials of governments gone bad
 
03:19:37.309 --> 03:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
Nazi Germany Soviet Union Mao Zedong
 
03:19:41.809 --> 03:19:41.819 align:start position:0%
China Rwanda Cambodia
 
03:19:44.330 --> 03:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
Uganda Guatemala
 
03:19:48.050 --> 03:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
all of these countries had
 
03:19:51.710 --> 03:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
gun control regimes in place in some
 
03:19:54.230 --> 03:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
cases 90 years
 
03:19:56.929 --> 03:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
before the genocide occurred
 
03:20:00.469 --> 03:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
you should think of gun control laws as
 
03:20:04.010 --> 03:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
akin to expended but unexploded bonds
 
03:20:07.030 --> 03:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
and artillery shells
 
03:20:10.490 --> 03:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
Ukraine for the next century
 
03:20:13.429 --> 03:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
will have to send out teams
 
03:20:15.230 --> 03:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
to dig up
 
03:20:18.590 --> 03:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
and disarm or explode in place
 
03:20:21.650 --> 03:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
quote Doug rhymes
 
03:20:24.170 --> 03:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
how do I know this and I do know it with
 
03:20:24.180 --> 03:20:26.269 align:start position:0%
how do I know this and I do know it with
certainty

03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
certainty
 
03:20:29.710 --> 03:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
I know this because in Western Europe
 
03:20:33.230 --> 03:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
where a war has not been fought for 80
 
03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
where a war has not been fought for 80
years

03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:20:37.730 --> 03:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
governments there
 
03:20:41.750 --> 03:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
if not deadly certainly weekly France at
 
03:20:45.250 --> 03:20:45.260 align:start position:0%
Belgium Germany sometimes even Britain
 
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
send teams of military experts to disarm
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
unexploded ordinance and this stuff
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
remains lethal Mr simkin okay the
 
03:20:59.450 --> 03:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
committee appreciates the history but
 
03:21:01.490 --> 03:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
well the history day waiting period
 
03:21:06.190 --> 03:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:11.809 --> 03:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
because everyone here at some level buys
 
03:21:14.929 --> 03:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
the case that gun control saves lives
 
03:21:17.330 --> 03:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
and therefore the discussion is well how
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
do we
 
03:21:22.370 --> 03:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
adjust it to make it less onerous my
 
03:21:25.849 --> 03:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
point attacks the basic concept gun
 
03:21:28.610 --> 03:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
control clears the way not for a
 
03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
thousand murders for Millions
 
03:21:34.429 --> 03:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that it hasn't happened here
 
03:21:38.929 --> 03:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:41.809 --> 03:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
and this is a point that I really think
 
03:21:44.630 --> 03:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee need to
 
03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
think about
 
03:21:48.710 --> 03:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
because the same bills are brought back
 
03:21:52.610 --> 03:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
year after year after year because the
 
03:21:55.070 --> 03:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
assumption is gun control is a social
 
03:21:55.080 --> 03:21:57.230 align:start position:0%
assumption is gun control is a social
good

03:21:57.230 --> 03:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:22:00.410 --> 03:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
even in countries where Firearms are not
 
03:22:00.420 --> 03:22:01.490 align:start position:0%
even in countries where Firearms are not
abundant

03:22:01.490 --> 03:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
abundant
 
03:22:04.429 --> 03:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
it's a bad concept
 
03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
a lethally bad concept
 
03:22:09.290 --> 03:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:22:11.690 --> 03:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
committee for your time I appreciate it
 
03:22:14.590 --> 03:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
thank you happy to answer any questions
 
03:22:17.030 --> 03:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
relevant to my testimony
 
03:22:19.670 --> 03:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that availability uh
 
03:22:21.769 --> 03:22:21.779 align:start position:0%
you're welcome did you recognizes
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
up next will be James Gaffney thank you
 
03:22:32.510 --> 03:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
um some good testimony uh here
 
03:22:34.490 --> 03:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
um just standing there
 
03:22:36.650 --> 03:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
um or sitting there I should say
 
03:22:40.190 --> 03:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
um really brought up a lot of issues I
 
03:22:44.210 --> 03:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
hadn't really even thought of but um in
 
03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
terms in terms of this bill
 
03:22:49.250 --> 03:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
um I see a lot of this type of
 
03:22:51.530 --> 03:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
legislation being proposed for um
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:55.680 --> 03:22:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
and it's a pretty close uh issue to me
 
03:23:01.429 --> 03:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
um I can think of four people just
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
sitting there that I know or have a son
 
03:23:05.630 --> 03:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
actually in one case who uh took their
 
03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
life at the hand of a firearm
 
03:23:10.130 --> 03:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
um one of them actually is still alive
 
03:23:11.929 --> 03:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for her as a ward of the
 
03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts
 
03:23:18.110 --> 03:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
um so I understand the in intention
 
03:23:20.809 --> 03:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
um but I have to say that talking to all
 
03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
these people's families afterwards
 
03:23:24.479 --> 03:23:25.490 align:start position:0%
these people's families afterwards
um

03:23:25.490 --> 03:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
you know these were not stupid people
 
03:23:30.530 --> 03:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
they were just they were hurting and um
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
they would have found a way to take
 
03:23:34.370 --> 03:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
their lives with or without a firearm
 
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
that there's no doubt about that
 
03:23:39.349 --> 03:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
um is a firearm something that you use
 
03:23:43.130 --> 03:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
it's quick you can't take it back yes
 
03:23:43.140 --> 03:23:45.410 align:start position:0%
it's quick you can't take it back yes
um but

03:23:45.410 --> 03:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:23:47.690 --> 03:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
do we need to
 
03:23:49.250 --> 03:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
the cases that a lot of other people
 
03:23:50.929 --> 03:23:50.939 align:start position:0%
have made here is if somebody needs a
 
03:23:53.090 --> 03:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
gun I I specifically think of my
 
03:23:54.349 --> 03:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
children my
 
03:23:56.330 --> 03:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
um my two sons you know they're getting
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
older one of them died in my house one
 
03:23:58.969 --> 03:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
of them's about to be out of my house
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
and um I brought them up I've taught him
 
03:24:04.570 --> 03:24:04.580 align:start position:0%
how to shoot
 
03:24:08.990 --> 03:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
but they have no interest in Firearms at
 
03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:09.950 align:start position:0%
but they have no interest in Firearms at
all

03:24:09.950 --> 03:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:24:13.370 --> 03:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and but they know how to use them and
 
03:24:16.250 --> 03:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
God forbid they'd be in a situation
 
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
where they would ever need that firearm
 
03:24:20.450 --> 03:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
and they'd be in another state per se
 
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
say that state is a student or something
 
03:24:25.190 --> 03:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the year in New Hampshire and
 
03:24:28.670 --> 03:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
somebody uh relics you know basically
 
03:24:31.969 --> 03:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
says I want to kill you and it's a it's
 
03:24:35.929 --> 03:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
a you know a domestic situation
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
um whether it be a man or a woman and
 
03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else wants to do you harm well
 
03:24:43.849 --> 03:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
three days is a long time when somebody
 
03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
wants to kill you and I think for every
 
03:24:47.520 --> 03:24:48.769 align:start position:0%
wants to kill you and I think for every
action

03:24:48.769 --> 03:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
action
 
03:24:52.550 --> 03:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's a reaction so yes you know I
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
understand this is seen as a cooling off
 
03:24:56.570 --> 03:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
period uh somebody to kind of get their
 
03:24:59.210 --> 03:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
wits back about them but uh if you're
 
03:25:00.530 --> 03:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
the person who needs a gun because
 
03:25:03.469 --> 03:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to kill you it doesn't
 
03:25:05.450 --> 03:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
give you the opportunity to defend
 
03:25:08.510 --> 03:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
yourself uh in it discounts their life
 
03:25:10.550 --> 03:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
it does not give them the chance to
 
03:25:12.349 --> 03:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
defend their life
 
03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
um so but that would be my major issue
 
03:25:16.490 --> 03:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
with it
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and in a lot of cases uh in
 
03:25:21.370 --> 03:25:21.380 align:start position:0%
specifically all the ones that I am
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a little too familiar with
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
those guns were already owned they were
 
03:25:28.190 --> 03:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
already in possession you know and other
 
03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
people I know you know I mean but they
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
could have used a charcoal grill
 
03:25:36.050 --> 03:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
um just as easily as they could have
 
03:25:36.060 --> 03:25:37.130 align:start position:0%
um just as easily as they could have
um

03:25:37.130 --> 03:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
a firearm
 
03:25:42.410 --> 03:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
um so anyhow thank you
 
03:25:44.809 --> 03:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony the chair
 
03:25:47.929 --> 03:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
calls James Gaffney and Penny Dean will
 
03:25:51.650 --> 03:25:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:53.450 --> 03:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
this bill is very similar to the last
 
03:25:57.349 --> 03:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
I'll let Penny go into the structural
 
03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
details of it but this is a bill that is
 
03:26:05.929 --> 03:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
written in such a manner that it is
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
it tries to lump together two different
 
03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:10.190 align:start position:0%
it tries to lump together two different
issues

03:26:10.190 --> 03:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:26:13.309 --> 03:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
suicide is very very different than
 
03:26:15.530 --> 03:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
someone committing violence against
 
03:26:18.170 --> 03:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
another person right that's the first
 
03:26:21.410 --> 03:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
thing the second thing is is that
 
03:26:23.389 --> 03:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to do something
 
03:26:26.090 --> 03:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
whether it's kill themselves or commit a
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
violent act right in the second case we
 
03:26:30.530 --> 03:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
already have laws against that it's
 
03:26:32.510 --> 03:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
illegal to murder somebody it's illegal
 
03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
to commit assault it's illegal 16
 
03:26:36.769 --> 03:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
different ways so if they already have a
 
03:26:39.410 --> 03:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
gun or a knife or baseball bat or an
 
03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
automobile or any other tool this makes
 
03:26:43.670 --> 03:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
me a tool user
 
03:26:46.849 --> 03:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh they're gonna find a way to do it and
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
nothing you can you say or do can stop
 
03:26:51.889 --> 03:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
them from doing it
 
03:26:55.490 --> 03:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
period full stop you are not going to
 
03:26:59.150 --> 03:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
stop people from this law is not going
 
03:27:02.870 --> 03:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
to cause somebody to say oh wow now that
 
03:27:05.929 --> 03:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
it's 17 times illegal I'm not going to
 
03:27:08.210 --> 03:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
do it it's like the joke about the
 
03:27:10.490 --> 03:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
British police stop or I'll say stop
 
03:27:10.500 --> 03:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
British police stop or I'll say stop
again

03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:14.330 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:27:14.330 --> 03:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
as far as suicide goes
 
03:27:19.370 --> 03:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
well I haven't heard anybody offer much
 
03:27:22.010 --> 03:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
information I just want to interrupt you
 
03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
real quick I wanted to recognize in the
 
03:27:25.969 --> 03:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
gallery we have a class of school
 
03:27:27.410 --> 03:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
children here today and I wanted to
 
03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank them for coming in to take part in
 
03:27:32.269 --> 03:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh this government exercise so thank you
 
03:27:33.410 --> 03:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
very much and welcome to the New
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house
 
03:27:37.250 --> 03:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
03:27:39.530 --> 03:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
as far as suicide goes we haven't heard
 
03:27:41.990 --> 03:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
anybody talk to the reasons that people
 
03:27:45.290 --> 03:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
commit suicide it's very it's everything
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
from mental illness to people who are
 
03:27:50.210 --> 03:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
terminally ill and want to end their
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
lives and
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's an important point
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
because nobody's talked about it before
 
03:27:59.210 --> 03:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
this is my life if I'm facing a terminal
 
03:28:01.729 --> 03:28:01.739 align:start position:0%
illness it's not up to any of you or
 
03:28:05.150 --> 03:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else to tell me whether or not I
 
03:28:09.170 --> 03:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
can choose to end my life or not
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
this bill it's a complicated issue with
 
03:28:15.889 --> 03:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
this bill in the end will not accomplish
 
03:28:19.010 --> 03:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
anything but trample the rights of
 
03:28:19.020 --> 03:28:20.630 align:start position:0%
anything but trample the rights of
people

03:28:20.630 --> 03:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:28:24.170 --> 03:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
over and over and over
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
please give this an itl rating any
 
03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:29.809 align:start position:0%
please give this an itl rating any
questions

03:28:29.809 --> 03:28:29.819 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:28:41.090 --> 03:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
03:28:45.590 --> 03:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee good afternoon and I would ask
 
03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
that uitl this bill despite its laudable
 
03:28:49.319 --> 03:28:50.929 align:start position:0%
that uitl this bill despite its laudable
goals

03:28:50.929 --> 03:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
goals
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
as judges tell me all the time connect
 
03:28:57.590 --> 03:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
the dads tell me how it's relevant they
 
03:28:59.630 --> 03:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
can't this isn't anything that we should
 
03:29:02.090 --> 03:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
quote have to deal with this is a
 
03:29:04.250 --> 03:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
constitutional right
 
03:29:06.170 --> 03:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
and that's really what's important I
 
03:29:08.510 --> 03:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
happen to do divorces there's no waiting
 
03:29:08.520 --> 03:29:10.130 align:start position:0%
happen to do divorces there's no waiting
period

03:29:10.130 --> 03:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:29:11.809 --> 03:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
you know they have 30 days like
 
03:29:13.849 --> 03:29:13.859 align:start position:0%
everything else before if kicks and be
 
03:29:15.769 --> 03:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
for an appeal period that's not a
 
03:29:17.750 --> 03:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
waiting period it happens with all sorts
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
of cases there's a period of time in
 
03:29:23.090 --> 03:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
which either party can appeal
 
03:29:25.190 --> 03:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
but you're talking again about a
 
03:29:27.950 --> 03:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional right here that's a big
 
03:29:30.290 --> 03:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
deal but when we look at
 
03:29:33.229 --> 03:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
I call them dog whistles at the anti-gun
 
03:29:35.710 --> 03:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
Community whenever you hear the words
 
03:29:37.929 --> 03:29:37.939 align:start position:0%
reasonable restriction
 
03:29:39.950 --> 03:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
03:29:42.670 --> 03:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
those should be keywords to you
 
03:29:44.830 --> 03:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
anti-second Amendment litigation
 
03:29:47.870 --> 03:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and that's what it is and to
 
03:29:50.210 --> 03:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
say that people support this I don't buy
 
03:29:52.130 --> 03:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
it I haven't seen any surveys that they
 
03:29:54.410 --> 03:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
support things like this and I
 
03:29:56.990 --> 03:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
understand that suicide may be an
 
03:30:00.290 --> 03:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
impulsive issue don't disagree with that
 
03:30:02.570 --> 03:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
but here so you're telling me that
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
people who have taken Hunter education
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
are not impulsive
 
03:30:08.690 --> 03:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
it just so happens that I've taught
 
03:30:10.670 --> 03:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
Hunter I've taught Hunter education
 
03:30:14.210 --> 03:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting story for 17 years
 
03:30:17.630 --> 03:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
so it says here that if you have certain
 
03:30:20.450 --> 03:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
Criterion that you would be exempt from
 
03:30:20.460 --> 03:30:21.410 align:start position:0%
Criterion that you would be exempt from
that

03:30:21.410 --> 03:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:25.370 --> 03:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
and again back to connecting the dots so
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell me that if I just
 
03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
go out and buy a hunting license I'm
 
03:30:29.640 --> 03:30:31.370 align:start position:0%
go out and buy a hunting license I'm
exempt

03:30:31.370 --> 03:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense to me it
 
03:30:36.050 --> 03:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense whatsoever the
 
03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
other thing that we hear about more and
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
more and more
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
is police and firemen about how they're
 
03:30:44.450 --> 03:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
really stressed out about their jobs
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
lately they're having higher and higher
 
03:30:49.130 --> 03:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
and higher suicide rates and they are
 
03:30:51.050 --> 03:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
taking mental health breaks
 
03:30:53.690 --> 03:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
and so what about the police officer who
 
03:30:55.429 --> 03:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
has a domestic violence restraining
 
03:30:57.050 --> 03:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
order against him
 
03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
they pulled he's off work
 
03:31:01.910 --> 03:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
paid or unpaid
 
03:31:04.130 --> 03:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
he can walk in
 
03:31:06.050 --> 03:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
because he's exempt from that waiting
 
03:31:08.210 --> 03:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
period according to this
 
03:31:10.670 --> 03:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
but I think the thing that probably
 
03:31:13.130 --> 03:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
concerns me or one of the most important
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
things concerns me of this
 
03:31:21.410 --> 03:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
is that if you look at page one line 25
 
03:31:25.010 --> 03:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
and 26. there's an exemption for a
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
person who has obtained a valid
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
restraining order
 
03:31:30.650 --> 03:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
anybody on planet Earth can get a
 
03:31:33.469 --> 03:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
temporary restraining order ex parte
 
03:31:36.290 --> 03:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
before the person has a right to a
 
03:31:36.300 --> 03:31:37.670 align:start position:0%
before the person has a right to a
hearing

03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
and there's an old saying that you could
 
03:31:41.809 --> 03:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
indict a ham sandwich and it's about
 
03:31:43.849 --> 03:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
darn true when it comes to some of these
 
03:31:45.769 --> 03:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
temporary orders
 
03:31:48.530 --> 03:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
and so you look at a person the question
 
03:31:50.750 --> 03:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
is is this going to incentivize people
 
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
to make false accusations against other
 
03:31:53.640 --> 03:31:55.130 align:start position:0%
to make false accusations against other
people

03:31:55.130 --> 03:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:31:58.010 --> 03:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a problem
 
03:31:59.570 --> 03:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have I'm not saying
 
03:32:01.370 --> 03:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
everyone or all of them but I'm saying I
 
03:32:03.290 --> 03:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
can see a person going into a police
 
03:32:03.300 --> 03:32:04.490 align:start position:0%
can see a person going into a police
department

03:32:04.490 --> 03:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:32:06.650 --> 03:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
and having someone because I've seen all
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
sorts of officials do it NAD nod wink
 
03:32:11.690 --> 03:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
wink nudge nudge if this was your
 
03:32:15.530 --> 03:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
problem I could help you are you scared
 
03:32:17.870 --> 03:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
and so you have to ask yourself how many
 
03:32:20.809 --> 03:32:20.819 align:start position:0%
false accusations will get out of this
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
and how many temporary orders that once
 
03:32:27.170 --> 03:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
there's a hearing are dismissed be it
 
03:32:29.389 --> 03:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
that person got away with no waiting
 
03:32:29.399 --> 03:32:30.349 align:start position:0%
that person got away with no waiting
period

03:32:30.349 --> 03:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:32:31.969 --> 03:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying there should be a
 
03:32:33.590 --> 03:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
waiting period I'm totally against it's
 
03:32:35.450 --> 03:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
constitutional right it's not like
 
03:32:37.250 --> 03:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
buying a car it's not like in a divorce
 
03:32:39.290 --> 03:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
it's not like anything else but there
 
03:32:41.269 --> 03:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
are huge mechanical and inequitable
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
problems in this and for someone to
 
03:32:45.530 --> 03:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
suggest that certain categories of
 
03:32:49.070 --> 03:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
people essentially are less impulsive
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to worry about them
 
03:32:52.190 --> 03:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
they can buy guns but all the other
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
people they're impulsive so we're going
 
03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
to stop them and save their life I think
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's patently ridiculous
 
03:33:00.349 --> 03:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer any questions and
 
03:33:03.889 --> 03:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh the
 
03:33:08.690 --> 03:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
chair is recalling Joanne Brown I
 
03:33:12.530 --> 03:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:15.889 --> 03:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
you don't want to testify this one
 
03:33:18.349 --> 03:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh anyone else hasn't
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:23.040 --> 03:33:26.450 align:start position:0%
 
who

03:33:26.450 --> 03:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:32.710 --> 03:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:35.210 --> 03:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
while the intentions of this legislation
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
attempt to stop some of the suicides
 
03:33:38.570 --> 03:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
that occur in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
it does not address the actual issue of
 
03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
suicide nor help the people who are
 
03:33:46.969 --> 03:33:46.979 align:start position:0%
potentially thinking about suicide in
 
03:33:49.610 --> 03:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
2021 the latest official statistics from
 
03:33:51.790 --> 03:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
the Centers for Disease Control
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
223 Granite Staters committed suicide
 
03:33:56.809 --> 03:33:56.819 align:start position:0%
around half of those people used a
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
firearm why are legislators focusing on
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
only on Firearms rather than focusing on
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
the mental health help necessary to help
 
03:34:07.849 --> 03:34:07.859 align:start position:0%
all people who may be thinking of
 
03:34:09.590 --> 03:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
committing suicide
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
Japan has a higher rate of suicide per
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
capita than the United States and they
 
03:34:16.729 --> 03:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
don't have guns
 
03:34:19.490 --> 03:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
at the same time this legislation also
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
creates a deadly problem for others
 
03:34:23.809 --> 03:34:23.819 align:start position:0%
especially women who are in abusive
 
03:34:25.790 --> 03:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
situations or need to protect themselves
 
03:34:28.610 --> 03:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
from stalkers it serves the women who
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
are already victims of this abuse or
 
03:34:33.290 --> 03:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
stalking into victims of the legislature
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
because they are unable to purchase a
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
firearm to protect themselves thanks to
 
03:34:40.190 --> 03:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary weeding period that could
 
03:34:41.690 --> 03:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
mean the difference between life or
 
03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
death now we brought that up last time
 
03:34:47.389 --> 03:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
this again out of state legislation was
 
03:34:49.550 --> 03:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
pushed in the legislature so they
 
03:34:51.050 --> 03:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
changed it to include people who get
 
03:34:54.590 --> 03:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
restraining orders or if someone tells
 
03:34:57.950 --> 03:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
an officer that they are in reasonable
 
03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
fear of their life so really a woman is
 
03:35:04.250 --> 03:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
going to have to wait to prove she can
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
immediately practice her fundamental
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
human right to self-defense only if she
 
03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
gets a piece of paper or brings a police
 
03:35:14.510 --> 03:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
officer to the gun shop with her
 
03:35:17.450 --> 03:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
while we are um while we've been in here
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
there is a woman online her name is
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
Maura Chappelle she was going to be here
 
03:35:23.030 --> 03:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
but she stayed home due to illness but
 
03:35:25.370 --> 03:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
she's listening and she told me that it
 
03:35:27.530 --> 03:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
took her two days to get a restraining
 
03:35:29.690 --> 03:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
order from her abuser
 
03:35:31.849 --> 03:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
and she would have much preferred to go
 
03:35:33.710 --> 03:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
to a gun shop to try to protect herself
 
03:35:36.170 --> 03:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
but she couldn't
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
please vote in expedient to legislate on
 
03:35:41.030 --> 03:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
this bill the legislation will make it
 
03:35:43.250 --> 03:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
so women cannot save their own lives
 
03:35:45.650 --> 03:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
because law-abiding women will follow
 
03:35:48.889 --> 03:35:48.899 align:start position:0%
the law no matter how ridiculous their
 
03:35:52.670 --> 03:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
attackers will not do the same
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and that
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
being the last person I'm going to go
 
03:36:05.090 --> 03:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
what was yeah
 
03:36:10.490 --> 03:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
yeah regardless please come up and take
 
03:36:12.070 --> 03:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
the microphone
 
03:36:16.130 --> 03:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you William Rogers I think we look
 
03:36:18.410 --> 03:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
at guns differently
 
03:36:21.769 --> 03:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
here in this room I look at it as a
 
03:36:25.490 --> 03:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
self-defense tool strictly
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
to defend myself and to defend my family
 
03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
defend my country defend my state being
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
a self-defense tool like other people
 
03:36:37.729 --> 03:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
have done there might be times I want it
 
03:36:39.590 --> 03:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
immediately and I might be a person who
 
03:36:41.690 --> 03:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
never had one before
 
03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
why should I be infringed if you see it
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
as a suicide tool strictly as a weapon
 
03:36:51.410 --> 03:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
of violence to to do harm I could see
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
that makes sense but if you see it as a
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
defense weapon it makes no sense and I'm
 
03:36:58.610 --> 03:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
not just talking about it's certainly
 
03:37:01.190 --> 03:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
valid a woman who's been stalked or has
 
03:37:04.190 --> 03:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
someone else feels threatened and I see
 
03:37:05.450 --> 03:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
that woman
 
03:37:08.090 --> 03:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
I don't see a suicidal person with a gun
 
03:37:10.250 --> 03:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
to their head that's a horrible tragic
 
03:37:13.370 --> 03:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
then I see a woman behind her door and
 
03:37:16.849 --> 03:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
she's relieved she's real she's signed
 
03:37:18.950 --> 03:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
she's breathing a sigh of relief that
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
she can protect herself
 
03:37:25.190 --> 03:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
and as the lawyer said go on to the this
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
is an infringement on the Second
 
03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment plain and simple it's we have
 
03:37:33.170 --> 03:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
the right to defend ourselves why would
 
03:37:35.450 --> 03:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
we wait to do it and this could also be
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
not just a stalker it could be a natural
 
03:37:40.010 --> 03:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
disaster coming we know there's the
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
hurricane of the century coming and
 
03:37:44.090 --> 03:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
we're worried about looting we're
 
03:37:46.729 --> 03:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
worried about things like that if I had
 
03:37:49.190 --> 03:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
no weapon I would go out and get one and
 
03:37:52.130 --> 03:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
I would expect to be able to to protect
 
03:37:55.269 --> 03:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
myself because it is a dissell defense
 
03:37:58.969 --> 03:37:58.979 align:start position:0%
tool strictly thank you
 
03:38:01.790 --> 03:38:01.800 align:start position:0%

and we learned of the horrific shoot
 
03:39:03.899 --> 03:39:06.050 align:start position:0%
and we learned of the horrific shoot
again

03:39:06.050 --> 03:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:39:08.990 --> 03:39:09.000 align:start position:0%

at the time Bob Weisberg looked at me
 
03:39:29.690 --> 03:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
and said you know Steve New Hampshire is
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
not Mayberry anymore
 
03:39:33.950 --> 03:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
in regardless of some of the testimony
 
03:39:36.290 --> 03:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
we've heard New Hampshire really isn't
 
03:39:39.710 --> 03:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
maybe he was right 25 years ago
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm here to ask the committee to support
 
03:39:45.550 --> 03:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 78 which would repeal
 
03:39:49.450 --> 03:39:49.460 align:start position:0%
uh 1178 which restricts law enforcement
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
uh involvement in the enforcement of any
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
federal gun law that could impair the
 
03:39:57.769 --> 03:39:57.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's right to bear on
 
03:40:00.050 --> 03:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
last September
 
03:40:02.750 --> 03:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
within the Attorney General our current
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general for Miller issued a
 
03:40:08.030 --> 03:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
six-page memorandum to New Hampshire
 
03:40:10.010 --> 03:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
armed forcement going through the
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
various points that have already been
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
brought up that officers could be
 
03:40:16.130 --> 03:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
concerned about if what they were doing
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
were legal over the violating
 
03:40:19.680 --> 03:40:20.510 align:start position:0%
were legal over the violating
um

03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:23.210 --> 03:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
the RSA that forbid them involving
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
themselves in federal gun laws
 
03:40:26.990 --> 03:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the things the Attorney
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
General pointed out on page three of his
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
memorandum was be very careful although
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
your law enforcement officer you could
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
be charged under federal law with aiding
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
and abetting if you should not do
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
something you should legally do for
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
example if you're searching a prisoner
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
are you located a handgun that's illegal
 
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
you've got to make sure that you seize
 
03:40:51.650 --> 03:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
that as you would any evidence is turned
 
03:40:53.630 --> 03:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
over a federal agent so they can
 
03:40:55.610 --> 03:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
prosecute that case
 
03:40:59.170 --> 03:40:59.180 align:start position:0%
the he also said don't confuse
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
assistance with cooperation they aren't
 
03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
the same you have certain rights
 
03:41:07.729 --> 03:41:07.739 align:start position:0%
in the six page memorandum was followed
 
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
by several uh uh frequently frequently
 
03:41:12.490 --> 03:41:12.500 align:start position:0%
asked questions
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and I wouldn't be surprised if
 
03:41:17.809 --> 03:41:17.819 align:start position:0%
the ehe had to do a supplemental because
 
03:41:19.929 --> 03:41:19.939 align:start position:0%
you did a wonderful job of pointing out
 
03:41:22.490 --> 03:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
where you could belong and what you're
 
03:41:22.500 --> 03:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
where you could belong and what you're
doing

03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:41:25.849 --> 03:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
and This concerns me and it goes back to
 
03:41:27.950 --> 03:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
what I talked about that horrific depth
 
03:41:31.370 --> 03:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
and those that died the offices acted
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
superbly but my fear today as a local
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
officer or a state officer could get
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
involved in a situation and be hesitant
 
03:41:43.130 --> 03:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
for just a few seconds because they're
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
not sure if they're violating the state
 
03:41:45.120 --> 03:41:46.130 align:start position:0%
not sure if they're violating the state
law

03:41:46.130 --> 03:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:48.170 align:start position:0%
law
and

03:41:48.170 --> 03:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:50.030 --> 03:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
and I'd hate to see that kind of a
 
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
tragedy happen again in New Hampshire
 
03:41:54.170 --> 03:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
and I thank you again Mr chairman if
 
03:41:55.729 --> 03:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
there are any questions I'd be glad to
 
03:41:58.269 --> 03:41:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%

the chair recognizes The Honorable John
 
03:42:09.420 --> 03:42:16.490 align:start position:0%

just for everyone's information I'm
 
03:42:20.330 --> 03:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
going to do two more witnesses and we
 
03:42:21.889 --> 03:42:21.899 align:start position:0%
are going to take a short lunch break
 
03:42:25.370 --> 03:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:27.410 --> 03:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and fine committee
 
03:42:29.750 --> 03:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
members again I am a former
 
03:42:31.849 --> 03:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
representative John Burt I served 12
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
years here
 
03:42:34.319 --> 03:42:35.510 align:start position:0%
years here
um

03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:37.670 --> 03:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
03:42:40.130 --> 03:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
I'm a little concerned on this bill
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
because it repeals 1178
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:50.929 --> 03:42:50.939 align:start position:0%
uh 1178
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
that house bill 78 repeals
 
03:42:56.690 --> 03:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
um I worked extremely hard to get it
 
03:42:56.700 --> 03:42:58.790 align:start position:0%
um I worked extremely hard to get it
right

03:42:58.790 --> 03:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:43:03.889 --> 03:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:11.929 --> 03:43:11.939 align:start position:0%
has the case in Colebrook
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the feds for whatever reason I don't
 
03:43:16.130 --> 03:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
know if they were involved with the
 
03:43:19.130 --> 03:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
Colebrook case but if they were
 
03:43:21.590 --> 03:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement
 
03:43:23.210 --> 03:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
can help
 
03:43:27.050 --> 03:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
because you broke New Hampshire law
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's that easy
 
03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's why the governor signed this this
 
03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
is a good bill that this that house bill
 
03:43:37.010 --> 03:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
78 is trying to repeal so I hope uitl
 
03:43:39.170 --> 03:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:43:42.050 --> 03:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out that I was very
 
03:43:42.060 --> 03:43:43.729 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out that I was very
honored

03:43:43.729 --> 03:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
honored
 
03:43:45.650 --> 03:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
there's a magazine called the American
 
03:43:45.660 --> 03:43:48.110 align:start position:0%
there's a magazine called the American
Revolution

03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
Revolution
 
03:43:50.929 --> 03:43:50.939 align:start position:0%
that is put out and it was put out on
 
03:43:52.969 --> 03:43:52.979 align:start position:0%
the core of the fourth quarter of last
 
03:43:52.979 --> 03:43:58.490 align:start position:0%
the core of the fourth quarter of last
year

03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:01.130 --> 03:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
unmentioned in that bill or the the
 
03:44:01.140 --> 03:44:02.950 align:start position:0%
unmentioned in that bill or the the
magazine

03:44:02.950 --> 03:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
magazine
 
03:44:06.290 --> 03:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
again the American Revolution
 
03:44:07.729 --> 03:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
it says
 
03:44:11.450 --> 03:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire emerges as a beacon of
 
03:44:11.460 --> 03:44:14.809 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire emerges as a beacon of
Liberty

03:44:14.809 --> 03:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it was by Heather uh fazo
 
03:44:21.889 --> 03:44:21.899 align:start position:0%
what the article read real quick is this
 
03:44:23.450 --> 03:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
one section it says with the leadership
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
of John Burr the law has been corrected
 
03:44:28.010 --> 03:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
and that the citizens of New Hampshire
 
03:44:32.150 --> 03:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
now can move forward uh move about the
 
03:44:32.160 --> 03:44:33.349 align:start position:0%
now can move forward uh move about the
mountains

03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
mountains
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
fully armed with on the snowmobiles and
 
03:44:38.809 --> 03:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
that was another bill but then it goes
 
03:44:40.130 --> 03:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
into this
 
03:44:43.550 --> 03:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
more uh significantly
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
Rhett Bert House Bill 1178 effectively
 
03:44:50.210 --> 03:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
rejects federal gun control a certain
 
03:44:52.490 --> 03:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
that state and local law enforcement
 
03:44:55.969 --> 03:44:55.979 align:start position:0%
will not cooperate with the Bureau of
 
03:44:55.979 --> 03:44:58.550 align:start position:0%
will not cooperate with the Bureau of
ATF

03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
ATF
 
03:45:01.690 --> 03:45:01.700 align:start position:0%
and then it also says what the real
 
03:45:05.630 --> 03:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
world impacts of this bill earlier this
 
03:45:08.450 --> 03:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
year the White House announced a new
 
03:45:11.690 --> 03:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
rule that would ban ghost guns
 
03:45:14.570 --> 03:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
that's the build kit which allow you to
 
03:45:16.490 --> 03:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
create a firearm without a serial number
 
03:45:19.790 --> 03:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1178 that this bill is trying
 
03:45:21.910 --> 03:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
to repeal
 
03:45:25.490 --> 03:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
states that local and fish local and
 
03:45:28.010 --> 03:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
state officials are forbidden to help
 
03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
federal agents in an unconstitutional
 
03:45:32.279 --> 03:45:34.250 align:start position:0%
federal agents in an unconstitutional
rule

03:45:34.250 --> 03:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
rule
 
03:45:37.090 --> 03:45:37.100 align:start position:0%
so that's what this is trying to repeal
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
is my house bill 1178
 
03:45:43.250 --> 03:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
which is protecting New Hampshire
 
03:45:47.450 --> 03:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
citizens from unconstitutional laws that
 
03:45:50.750 --> 03:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
the feds or rules that the feds pass
 
03:45:54.410 --> 03:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
so I asked you to itl this because again
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a very safe state
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
we want to protect ourselves from the
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
federal government's overreach up here
 
03:46:04.490 --> 03:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
everybody on this board everybody out
 
03:46:07.130 --> 03:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
here both sides always says local
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
control well I don't want the feds to
 
03:46:13.190 --> 03:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
come up here and to borrow my Goffstown
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
policemen to come to my house if they
 
03:46:17.630 --> 03:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
feel I did something wrong
 
03:46:20.450 --> 03:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
which I didn't
 
03:46:22.969 --> 03:46:22.979 align:start position:0%
and that is the way it should be the
 
03:46:27.530 --> 03:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
feds do not need our tax paid local
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
police help
 
03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
to enforce their unconstitutional rules
 
03:46:37.550 --> 03:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
or laws so please itl House Bill 78
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
calls Brian blackton this will be the
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.590 --> 03:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
this is real short
 
03:47:03.050 --> 03:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
I asked itl this bill
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
I believe it is merely an attempt at
 
03:47:08.090 --> 03:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
strategically trying to form the
 
03:47:10.670 --> 03:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
groundwork to remove arms from citizens
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
making them subjects we already had that
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
discussion and it didn't go well for
 
03:47:15.359 --> 03:47:17.210 align:start position:0%
discussion and it didn't go well for
Britain

03:47:17.210 --> 03:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
Britain
 
03:47:20.750 --> 03:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we have article 2A and 10 in

04:51:37.128 --> 04:51:37.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tom minion I
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro One Pelham I'm here
 
04:51:43.610 --> 04:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
to speak against HB 78.
 
04:51:45.288 --> 04:51:45.298 align:start position:0%
the federal government creates so many
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
rules and laws that even their bloated
 
04:51:49.730 --> 04:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
agencies are incapable of enforcing them
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
all as such they rely on our law
 
04:51:53.690 --> 04:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement to waste time and resources
 
04:51:55.250 --> 04:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
aiding in any number of potentially
 
04:51:58.010 --> 04:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Acts then reward such
 
04:51:59.570 --> 04:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
obedience for things like barricade
 
04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
Bearcats that the police then use to
 
04:52:03.890 --> 04:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
smash in the front uh private residents
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
just because they can
 
04:52:07.850 --> 04:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement should be focused on
 
04:52:09.770 --> 04:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
the laws of New Hampshire we are not
 
04:52:11.810 --> 04:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
obligated to assist the feds in with
 
04:52:13.368 --> 04:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
whatever new rules they create
 
04:52:16.128 --> 04:52:16.138 align:start position:0%
especially as it pertains to firearms
 
04:52:18.650 --> 04:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
the atf's own rules are extremely fluid
 
04:52:20.570 --> 04:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
in nature and they don't wait for a law
 
04:52:22.368 --> 04:52:22.378 align:start position:0%
to come from Congress to just decide to
 
04:52:26.030 --> 04:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
ban new things the latest pistol braces
 
04:52:28.368 --> 04:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
but before that an executive order from
 
04:52:30.288 --> 04:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
president Trump and bump stocks only to
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
be overturned by the courts so in the
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
interim while these unconstitutional
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
rules in the executive orders came into
 
04:52:37.490 --> 04:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
existence with no oversight any one of
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
us could become a felon in our sleep
 
04:52:42.890 --> 04:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
last year last year's House Bill 1178
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
and John Burt great guy uh put it put an
 
04:52:47.628 --> 04:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
end to wasting our law enforcement's
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
time with these wild swings in policy
 
04:52:50.810 --> 04:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
from D.C
 
04:52:53.810 --> 04:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
if the feds want to enforce these laws
 
04:52:55.788 --> 04:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
there's sadly not much we can do about
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
it yet
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
but they're going to have a much harder
 
04:53:02.750 --> 04:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
time doing it alone despite what the ATF
 
04:53:04.550 --> 04:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
and others believe we have a natural
 
04:53:06.830 --> 04:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
right to self-defense and we respect
 
04:53:08.570 --> 04:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
that here in New Hampshire
 
04:53:10.430 --> 04:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
I personally believe the ATF is an
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
illegal Opera organization responsible
 
04:53:13.850 --> 04:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
for many deaths caused by their actions
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
over the decades I do not want our state
 
04:53:17.868 --> 04:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies cooperating
 
04:53:19.970 --> 04:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
with them and ideally we'll create an
 
04:53:22.010 --> 04:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
alert system warning communities that
 
04:53:23.330 --> 04:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
they are in danger whenever they are on
 
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
the Move akin to a Midwestern tornado
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
sirens I asked the committee to itl hb78
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to take any questions
 
04:53:33.288 --> 04:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
04:53:33.298 --> 04:53:35.090 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
afternoon

04:53:35.090 --> 04:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
04:53:42.288 --> 04:53:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:47.230 --> 04:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
look uh just a quick Point um the the
 
04:53:49.730 --> 04:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
public employees of the State of New
 
04:53:51.770 --> 04:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're supposed to serve the
 
04:53:53.690 --> 04:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
constituents of New Hampshire not the
 
04:53:56.930 --> 04:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
federal agents and so uh I support the
 
04:54:01.010 --> 04:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
itl of pill 78 and I like to keep our
 
04:54:02.750 --> 04:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
public servants focused on just New
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and protecting New Hampshire
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
residents rather than throwing them in
 
04:54:08.810 --> 04:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
prison thank you that's all
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I also
 
04:54:21.288 --> 04:54:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.128 --> 04:54:25.138 align:start position:0%
thank you again and uh as as I've said
 
04:54:26.990 --> 04:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
before I'm representing both the New
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society and the New
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychiatric Society and you
 
04:54:31.798 --> 04:54:32.448 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychiatric Society and you
know

04:54:32.448 --> 04:54:32.458 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
listening to so much testimony this
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
morning and beginning this afternoon
 
04:54:38.878 --> 04:54:40.310 align:start position:0%
morning and beginning this afternoon
uh

04:54:40.310 --> 04:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:43.010 --> 04:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
it almost seems like
 
04:54:46.070 --> 04:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
so many people in New Hampshire don't
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
salute the American flag
 
04:54:53.390 --> 04:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
um they only seem to want to follow laws
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:54:58.390 --> 04:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was well
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
HB 78.
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to repeal what many of us
 
04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
think is an unconstitutional law as it
 
04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
is 1178.
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
now as a psychiatrist in New Hampshire
 
04:55:16.610 --> 04:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
I've been aware ever since I came to the
 
04:55:20.990 --> 04:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
state almost almost 50 years ago
 
04:55:25.070 --> 04:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does not send the
 
04:55:30.530 --> 04:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
who are
 
04:55:32.638 --> 04:55:34.030 align:start position:0%
who are
committed

04:55:34.030 --> 04:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
committed
 
04:55:37.128 --> 04:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
after meeting with the judge
 
04:55:39.050 --> 04:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
because they're a danger to themselves
 
04:55:40.490 --> 04:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
or others
 
04:55:43.850 --> 04:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
so people who individuals who are
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
committed can leave the hospital
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
and their their names are not sent to
 
04:55:53.570 --> 04:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:56.570 --> 04:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
um and so they can go out and buy a gun
 
04:55:59.448 --> 04:55:59.458 align:start position:0%
that has never seemed to be a
 
04:56:02.270 --> 04:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
particularly good idea
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
um for one who wants to have safety in
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
our state
 
04:56:14.270 --> 04:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
we don't keep track of those records so
 
04:56:17.690 --> 04:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
we don't really know what happens to
 
04:56:19.788 --> 04:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
those patients after they leave the
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
hospital in terms of whether a certain
 
04:56:25.310 --> 04:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of them
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
commit violence towards themselves or
 
04:56:29.628 --> 04:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
04:56:34.090 --> 04:56:34.100 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing about this uh 1178
 
04:56:37.610 --> 04:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really make sense to me and
 
04:56:39.170 --> 04:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense to me either
 
04:56:43.610 --> 04:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
because we're one of 50 states in this
 
04:56:43.620 --> 04:56:44.690 align:start position:0%
because we're one of 50 states in this
country

04:56:44.690 --> 04:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
country
 
04:56:46.970 --> 04:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
and why shouldn't we do whatever we can
 
04:56:50.810 --> 04:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
to prevent gun violence
 
04:56:53.690 --> 04:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
now there was somebody who who made a
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
statement that uh
 
04:56:59.510 --> 04:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
suicide is not a crime that is true but
 
04:57:02.570 --> 04:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's not terribly a good idea and if we
 
04:57:04.010 --> 04:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
can prevent it
 
04:57:06.190 --> 04:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
a psychiatrist is mental health
 
04:57:09.470 --> 04:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
individuals as families we would like to
 
04:57:13.250 --> 04:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
do something to prevent it
 
04:57:17.150 --> 04:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
now there's also uh a recent executive
 
04:57:20.350 --> 04:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
order uh
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
preventing uh
 
04:57:28.090 --> 04:57:28.100 align:start position:0%
or trying to regulate ghost guns
 
04:57:30.970 --> 04:57:30.980 align:start position:0%
why does it not make sense
 
04:57:35.570 --> 04:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
that we would have a mechanism
 
04:57:35.580 --> 04:57:37.310 align:start position:0%
that we would have a mechanism
to

04:57:37.310 --> 04:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:57:39.770 --> 04:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
prevent people who
 
04:57:39.780 --> 04:57:42.890 align:start position:0%
prevent people who
are

04:57:42.890 --> 04:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
not allowed to purchase a gun
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
to get a gun by another means
 
04:57:56.208 --> 04:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
and these ghost guns are being involved
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
in crimes more and more
 
04:58:01.850 --> 04:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
three four years ago maybe ten percent
 
04:58:05.330 --> 04:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
of crimes were committed with ghost guns
 
04:58:08.570 --> 04:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
around the country now 33 percent are
 
04:58:11.930 --> 04:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
and the percentages are going up
 
04:58:14.810 --> 04:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
if we want to prevent gun violence to
 
04:58:20.330 --> 04:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
follow some
 
04:58:23.930 --> 04:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
National laws as well as the laws in New
 
04:58:23.940 --> 04:58:24.948 align:start position:0%
National laws as well as the laws in New
Hampshire

Hampshire
 
04:58:28.128 --> 04:58:28.138 align:start position:0%
so that's why
 
04:58:30.170 --> 04:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
not only the New Hampshire Medical
 
04:58:31.910 --> 04:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
Society and the New Hampshire
 
04:58:34.850 --> 04:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Society but more than 70
 
04:58:38.330 --> 04:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
medical societies around the country
 
04:58:41.930 --> 04:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
are trying to encourage reasonable
 
04:58:44.690 --> 04:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
Common Sense gun laws and that includes
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
the American psyche American Medical
 
04:58:49.310 --> 04:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
Association so thank you very much
 
04:58:52.490 --> 04:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.330 --> 04:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:04.850 --> 04:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
and up next will be representative
 
04:59:07.250 --> 04:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
Heather Raymond
 
04:59:09.170 --> 04:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your time and I want
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
to thank each and every one of you
 
04:59:12.230 --> 04:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually for your time for being here
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
every week
 
04:59:16.010 --> 04:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
you probably don't hear it enough but
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
you it is appreciated by the worst of us
 
04:59:19.490 --> 04:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
who are just kind of private citizens
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
hanging around
 
04:59:22.730 --> 04:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I get up here about once a year at
 
04:59:24.410 --> 04:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
most and this is the only Bill I'm going
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
to speak about so
 
04:59:28.610 --> 04:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
um as you know already everyone knows
 
04:59:33.530 --> 04:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
that hb78 seeks to repeal hb1178
 
04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that bill tells
 
04:59:39.170 --> 04:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
the agencies of New Hampshire that they
 
04:59:40.930 --> 04:59:40.940 align:start position:0%
do not have to comply with any
 
04:59:44.270 --> 04:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional law rule or mandate
 
04:59:46.930 --> 04:59:46.940 align:start position:0%
imposed by the federal government
 
04:59:49.010 --> 04:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional means that it is not
 
04:59:51.410 --> 04:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
under the purview right of the federal
 
04:59:52.670 --> 04:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
government but under the state
 
04:59:52.680 --> 04:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
government but under the state
government

04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
when you think of it it's a little silly
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to have a bill that
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
tells the federal government that they
 
05:00:01.610 --> 05:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
can't do something that's not in their
 
05:00:03.230 --> 05:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
rules you know
 
05:00:05.330 --> 05:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
but um there it is that's where we are
 
05:00:07.368 --> 05:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
in 2023
 
05:00:11.330 --> 05:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh we can by the way regulate our own
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
rules here this is uh I know we're not
 
05:00:16.430 --> 05:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
doing history but I just verified that
 
05:00:19.128 --> 05:00:19.138 align:start position:0%
this is the chamber where we've been
 
05:00:21.948 --> 05:00:21.958 align:start position:0%
continuously doing business since 1819
 
05:00:24.770 --> 05:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
so you're a part of that
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
so I'll just ask you to I would ask you
 
05:00:30.830 --> 05:00:30.840 align:start position:0%

05:00:34.970 --> 05:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
let the legislature go on with all the
 
05:00:36.890 --> 05:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
many bills you have instead of repealing
 
05:00:39.288 --> 05:00:39.298 align:start position:0%
one you just did last year
 
05:00:41.448 --> 05:00:41.458 align:start position:0%

05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:01:05.470 --> 05:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
Lancaster New Hampshire

um and I'm very honored to be addressing
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
you today and I would like to strongly
 
05:01:16.250 --> 05:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 78 I say this to you as a
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
former federal employee a member of the
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
military with a long illustrious career
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
where I circled the globe at least three
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
times east to west north and south I've
 
05:01:29.930 --> 05:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
served in two Wars and I've been in
 
05:01:31.368 --> 05:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
areas of the world where there have been
 
05:01:33.230 --> 05:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
more penguins than people
 
05:01:36.288 --> 05:01:36.298 align:start position:0%
so I have a very in unique Insight on
 
05:01:39.770 --> 05:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
the U.S federal government and life here
 
05:01:41.570 --> 05:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I'm very grateful
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
to be here as a citizen of New Hampshire
 
05:01:48.110 --> 05:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
which is after all of my travels the
 
05:01:51.948 --> 05:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
place that I truly believe is the safest
 
05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
freest place in North America
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
this didn't happen by accident
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's in the DNA of New Hampshire
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's in the mortar of this very building
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire existed before the federal
 
05:02:09.240 --> 05:02:10.730 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire existed before the federal
government

05:02:10.730 --> 05:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
it had a constitution before the federal
 
05:02:15.850 --> 05:02:15.860 align:start position:0%
government and long after the federal
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
bloated Federal Behemoth passes away
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
into the Dustbin of History due to its
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
over uh printing of money and Corruption
 
05:02:29.208 --> 05:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:32.208 --> 05:02:32.218 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has done a
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful job of protecting the rights
 
05:02:36.288 --> 05:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
of its citizens
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
we have a exceptionally well-armed
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
populace and it's protected
 
05:02:44.090 --> 05:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
by a limited government
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
that we're fortunate to have even people
 
05:02:49.070 --> 05:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
here today who have actually put
 
05:02:52.250 --> 05:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
legislation forth to protect the rights
 
05:02:52.260 --> 05:02:53.868 align:start position:0%
legislation forth to protect the rights
of

05:02:53.868 --> 05:02:53.878 align:start position:0%

less anyone have any doubt about where
 
05:03:08.208 --> 05:03:08.218 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry let me just check one thing
 
05:03:09.890 --> 05:03:09.900 align:start position:0%

05:03:09.900 --> 05:03:17.150 align:start position:0%

05:03:26.770 --> 05:03:26.780 align:start position:0%
the article 7 of the New Hampshire
 
05:03:31.368 --> 05:03:31.378 align:start position:0%
Constitution expressly recognizes I I
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%

05:03:33.840 --> 05:03:34.690 align:start position:0%
actually invite all of you to reference
that

05:03:34.690 --> 05:03:34.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:38.030 --> 05:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
expressly recognizes the sovereignty
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire as a
 
05:03:43.550 --> 05:03:43.560 align:start position:0%

Republic
 
05:03:49.070 --> 05:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire decided to join what
 
05:03:51.708 --> 05:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
is now called the United States it
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
delegated certain things to it
 
05:03:57.050 --> 05:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
the United States government today has
 
05:04:00.670 --> 05:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
overstepped the bounds on so many levels
 
05:04:05.208 --> 05:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
we see it we see it we see a politicized
 
05:04:10.250 --> 05:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
FBI IRS Homeland Security ATF the Litany
 
05:04:13.670 --> 05:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
of alphabet agencies goes on and on
 
05:04:18.650 --> 05:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
and wise legislators with a sitting
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
Governor decided no
 
05:04:24.170 --> 05:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
we are
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
residents of a place called New
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we recognize the rights of our
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
citizens and we will not allow federal
 
05:04:34.550 --> 05:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
agents to come in and trample
 
05:04:37.310 --> 05:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
the people that live here
 
05:04:39.230 --> 05:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
and we're going to hold law enforcement
 
05:04:42.350 --> 05:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
and agencies accountable and I want to
 
05:04:44.750 --> 05:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
know and I'm grateful to know that my
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
County Sheriff My Town Police
 
05:04:53.208 --> 05:04:53.218 align:start position:0%
the new New Hampshire uh um State Police
 
05:04:56.208 --> 05:04:56.218 align:start position:0%
are there and they have my back
 
05:04:59.410 --> 05:04:59.420 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be part of that
 
05:05:02.030 --> 05:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
just perfidious
 
05:05:04.910 --> 05:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
circus that we see in Washington DC
 
05:05:06.770 --> 05:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
and whether you like Trump or Biden
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
Pelosi Schumer of the litany the circus
 
05:05:12.288 --> 05:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
continues and even though they have lost
 
05:05:17.090 --> 05:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
sight of what their mandate is I hope
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I pray that our legislators are wise
 
05:05:23.590 --> 05:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
enough to recognize
 
05:05:27.770 --> 05:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
the tragedy that is Washington D.C
 
05:05:31.010 --> 05:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
and the cabal that is there and all the
 
05:05:33.650 --> 05:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
many reasons why that's happening here
 
05:05:37.368 --> 05:05:37.378 align:start position:0%
we do it differently we've codified it
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
we recognize it the government doesn't
 
05:05:42.410 --> 05:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
give us rights it protects our rights
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
and I ask you each of you to remember
 
05:05:45.120 --> 05:05:47.628 align:start position:0%
and I ask you each of you to remember
that

05:05:47.628 --> 05:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:49.250 --> 05:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
we do it differently here in New

I mean or may not Hereafter be by them
 
05:07:54.530 --> 05:07:54.540 align:start position:0%

05:08:02.930 --> 05:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
it's not just about Firearms although we
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
are here talking about firearms
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
it is about government overreach
 
05:08:12.050 --> 05:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:15.170 --> 05:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
it's creeping up everywhere
 
05:08:18.410 --> 05:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
and guns Firearms we see what's going on
 
05:08:20.590 --> 05:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
executive orders for this
 
05:08:23.150 --> 05:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
reinterpretations for that I'm changing
 
05:08:24.410 --> 05:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
this rule
 
05:08:26.448 --> 05:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
the braces I'm sure those have been in
 
05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
the news lately we're all familiar with
 
05:08:30.670 --> 05:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
the braces that are becoming the the new
 
05:08:34.250 --> 05:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
Terror of the gun world
 
05:08:36.530 --> 05:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
a few years ago the ATF approved in a
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
letter saying yeah it's fine no problem
 
05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
now for some reason they changed their
 
05:08:41.520 --> 05:08:42.590 align:start position:0%
now for some reason they changed their
mind

05:08:42.590 --> 05:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
mind
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
they measure something a little bit
 
05:08:47.090 --> 05:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
different and go oh no now it's now it's
 
05:08:48.650 --> 05:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
going to be a short barrel rifle now you
 
05:08:52.128 --> 05:08:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:56.090 --> 05:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
we can go down the list of Education
 
05:09:00.410 --> 05:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
CRT maybe so on and so forth we all know
 
05:09:02.570 --> 05:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
what's in the news we all know what it's
 
05:09:04.970 --> 05:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
about I don't have to Hash it out here
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
there'll probably be another committee
 
05:09:08.208 --> 05:09:08.218 align:start position:0%
for that we can do that later on
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:17.930 --> 05:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
I believe I found this one each state
 
05:09:20.628 --> 05:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
to pave their own costs
 
05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
not to be separate from the United
 
05:09:25.970 --> 05:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
States but to be their own state
 
05:09:27.948 --> 05:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
each state is to be its own little
 
05:09:27.958 --> 05:09:30.050 align:start position:0%
each state is to be its own little
experiment

05:09:30.050 --> 05:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
experiment
 
05:09:33.890 --> 05:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
with doing it right in a lot of ways
 
05:09:38.030 --> 05:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
no income taxes no sales tax
 
05:09:42.050 --> 05:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:44.690 --> 05:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
low crime rate
 
05:09:49.490 --> 05:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
lots of Natural Resources camping skiing
 
05:09:52.250 --> 05:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
we have the coast we have lakes you name
 
05:09:55.430 --> 05:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
it we're doing it right
 
05:10:00.830 --> 05:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:03.530 --> 05:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
we should be Paving and steering our own
 
05:10:03.540 --> 05:10:04.730 align:start position:0%
we should be Paving and steering our own
course

05:10:04.730 --> 05:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
course
 
05:10:08.448 --> 05:10:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:12.770 --> 05:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:16.610 --> 05:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
with what could be unconstitutional laws
 
05:10:19.850 --> 05:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:21.890 --> 05:10:21.900 align:start position:0%

05:10:53.330 --> 05:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
05:10:56.090 --> 05:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
we make it work
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
nowhere else can you have
 
05:11:01.070 --> 05:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
such a diverse population
 
05:11:05.690 --> 05:11:05.700 align:start position:0%

05:11:32.050 --> 05:11:32.060 align:start position:0%
Adam
 
05:11:36.288 --> 05:11:36.298 align:start position:0%
we had a masters of our own destiny here
 
05:11:38.448 --> 05:11:38.458 align:start position:0%
this is just one example of overreach by
 
05:11:40.190 --> 05:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
05:11:42.650 --> 05:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
let's take care of ourselves
 
05:11:44.330 --> 05:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
not saying
 
05:11:46.610 --> 05:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
the blow off the United States not the
 
05:11:48.288 --> 05:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
same separate from them that's not what
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
I'm saying but there are some things
 
05:11:51.650 --> 05:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
which we could stand up for in the state
 
05:11:54.288 --> 05:11:54.298 align:start position:0%
and say that's enough
 
05:11:54.298 --> 05:11:55.430 align:start position:0%
and say that's enough
no

05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need to come in here and pull
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
our resources you've got an
 
05:12:02.270 --> 05:12:02.280 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:12:48.670 --> 05:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
I am here to
 
05:12:51.230 --> 05:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
05:12:53.330 --> 05:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
um it does seem
 
05:12:55.250 --> 05:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
um almost like we should never have
 
05:12:57.650 --> 05:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
needed this bill but that said it's it's
 
05:13:01.730 --> 05:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
here and um I don't see what harm there
 
05:13:04.010 --> 05:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
is in letting it stand
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
um you know when I look at something
 
05:13:09.948 --> 05:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
you know it's very short here and it
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
said it once it says the bill repeals a
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
Prohibition of a state of the state from
 
05:13:18.410 --> 05:13:18.420 align:start position:0%

05:13:25.670 --> 05:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
people to keep and bear arms
 
05:13:27.470 --> 05:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's basic that's
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's our that's our rights why would
 
05:13:32.208 --> 05:13:32.218 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
why would we want to restrict or
 
05:13:36.350 --> 05:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
regulate that
 
05:13:38.930 --> 05:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
um I mean I was a student of History
 
05:13:41.390 --> 05:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
which most people don't know I graduated
 
05:13:43.430 --> 05:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
UNH with a four-year degree a
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
non-western and had my fair share of um
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
American history known for you with
 
05:13:51.170 --> 05:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
history lesson but the one thing that I
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
always found interesting was that that
 
05:13:54.830 --> 05:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
most people didn't know is that the
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
the people of this country did not want
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
to ratify it it's a beloved document to
 
05:14:03.288 --> 05:14:03.298 align:start position:0%
us they didn't want to ratify it the
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
only way they were able to get the
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
document ratified was to add what we
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
call the Bill of Rights the first ten
 
05:14:11.208 --> 05:14:11.218 align:start position:0%
amendments and if they and those were
 
05:14:13.730 --> 05:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
known to be individual rights they they
 
05:14:16.610 --> 05:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
didn't they realized that the document
 
05:14:19.010 --> 05:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
gave too much power to a central
 
05:14:19.020 --> 05:14:19.970 align:start position:0%
gave too much power to a central
government

05:14:19.970 --> 05:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
and they had just what a revolution
 
05:14:26.270 --> 05:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
um or a war of insurrection depending on
 
05:14:27.948 --> 05:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
your Viewpoint
 
05:14:27.958 --> 05:14:28.570 align:start position:0%
your Viewpoint
um

05:14:28.570 --> 05:14:28.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:31.490 --> 05:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh against the Insurrection but it
 
05:14:31.500 --> 05:14:33.288 align:start position:0%
uh against the Insurrection but it
basically

05:14:33.288 --> 05:14:33.298 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:14:37.128 --> 05:14:37.138 align:start position:0%
they realized it was overreaching and by
 
05:14:38.868 --> 05:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
securing those individual rights
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
ensuring their individual rights they
 
05:14:40.320 --> 05:14:41.990 align:start position:0%
ensuring their individual rights they
allowed

05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
the Constitution they said okay we will
 
05:14:45.530 --> 05:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
ratify this because it secures
 
05:14:49.010 --> 05:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
individual rights and article one two
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
and three that form the executive branch
 
05:14:53.810 --> 05:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
that forms the legislature and the in
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
the the courts
 
05:14:57.170 --> 05:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
the only reason that those are allowed
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
to exist is because we said okay we'll
 
05:15:02.448 --> 05:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
allow this government to exist if we
 
05:15:04.128 --> 05:15:04.138 align:start position:0%
have these individual rights if you
 
05:15:06.050 --> 05:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
start taking away those rights you're
 
05:15:08.030 --> 05:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
starting to take away public trust and
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
when you take away public trust I don't
 
05:15:11.448 --> 05:15:11.458 align:start position:0%
know if we want to go down that road
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
because you know I put chills on my skin
 
05:15:16.490 --> 05:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
thinking of uh you know if we were to
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
take this bill
 
05:15:22.788 --> 05:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
and instead of the way it's written
 
05:15:24.650 --> 05:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
if I can find it here again which I
 
05:15:26.208 --> 05:15:26.218 align:start position:0%
probably can't
 
05:15:26.218 --> 05:15:28.070 align:start position:0%
probably can't
um

05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:35.868 --> 05:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to
 
05:15:37.910 --> 05:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
have if it was something that restricted
 
05:15:37.920 --> 05:15:39.830 align:start position:0%
have if it was something that restricted
say

05:15:39.830 --> 05:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:15:43.788 --> 05:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know freedom of religion
 
05:15:46.128 --> 05:15:46.138 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech press
 
05:15:46.138 --> 05:15:48.110 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech press
maybe

05:15:48.110 --> 05:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:15:50.570 --> 05:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
um in quartering soldiers in our homes
 
05:15:54.170 --> 05:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
or right to a fair trial it just sets a
 
05:15:58.850 --> 05:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
bad precedence and I uh basically my
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
concern with it more than anything uh
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
like I said I I don't see any reason to
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:09.120 --> 05:16:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:14.270 --> 05:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
in the fact that you know people you
 
05:16:16.128 --> 05:16:16.138 align:start position:0%
know basically the Constitution is null
 
05:16:18.770 --> 05:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
and void if people lose their individual
 
05:16:21.530 --> 05:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
rights they do not have to accept an
 
05:16:23.090 --> 05:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
executive branch they do not have to
 
05:16:25.850 --> 05:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
accept a Judicial judicial branch they
 
05:16:28.368 --> 05:16:28.378 align:start position:0%
do not have to accept the legislature if
 
05:16:31.190 --> 05:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
they feel as though uh those
 
05:16:34.190 --> 05:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
institutions are treading on their
 
05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
individual rights
 
05:16:38.330 --> 05:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
um that's it thank you
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:49.550 --> 05:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Dr John hink also
 
05:16:50.510 --> 05:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Society I'd like to agree
 
05:16:55.490 --> 05:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
with everything my colleague Len corn
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
just said we'd like to support hb78 to
 
05:17:03.288 --> 05:17:03.298 align:start position:0%
allow for federal gun safety laws such
 
05:17:05.810 --> 05:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
as the application of the Brady Law in
 
05:17:07.070 --> 05:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
the Brady Act is a federal law enacted
 
05:17:14.690 --> 05:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
in 1993 by the U.S Congress following
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
the assassination attempt against
 
05:17:21.650 --> 05:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:25.730 --> 05:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
um it prohibits firearm purchases from
 
05:17:27.650 --> 05:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
certain individuals
 
05:17:31.250 --> 05:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
who have been committed to a mental
 
05:17:31.260 --> 05:17:32.628 align:start position:0%
who have been committed to a mental
institution

05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
institution
 
05:17:34.310 --> 05:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
currently there are no State
 
05:17:37.730 --> 05:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on individuals committed to
 
05:17:39.708 --> 05:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
a mental institution from purchasing
 
05:17:39.718 --> 05:17:41.150 align:start position:0%
a mental institution from purchasing
firearms

05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
05:17:43.490 --> 05:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention
 
05:17:46.190 --> 05:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:17:59.448 --> 05:17:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:01.250 --> 05:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity I'll try to
 
05:18:03.830 --> 05:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
keep this brief I'd like to address a
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
comment that the previous speaker
 
05:18:09.050 --> 05:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
offered in testimony there are in fact
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
federal laws that prohibit the ownership
 
05:18:14.030 --> 05:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
of firearms
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
of people who are involuntarily
 
05:18:19.490 --> 05:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
committed to mental institutions that's
 
05:18:22.490 --> 05:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:25.390 --> 05:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
back to my own testimony if I may
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
well for lack of a better way of putting
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's like a dog you guys are supposed to
 
05:18:37.850 --> 05:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
found and protect our rights you took
 
05:18:40.490 --> 05:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
Oaths to uphold the the state and the
 
05:18:42.110 --> 05:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution
 
05:18:45.410 --> 05:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
those constitutions have explicit
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
language in in there that says that
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
government shall not infringe upon our
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
rights and that we it confirms our
 
05:18:56.448 --> 05:18:56.458 align:start position:0%
natural right to keep and bear arms and
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
defend ourselves our families our
 
05:18:58.320 --> 05:18:59.510 align:start position:0%
defend ourselves our families our
property

05:18:59.510 --> 05:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
etc etc etc so the existing statute
 
05:19:05.330 --> 05:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
really is is a no-brainer and
 
05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
the only reason I can think of that the
 
05:19:10.930 --> 05:19:10.940 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill would want to
 
05:19:15.368 --> 05:19:15.378 align:start position:0%
support unlawful actions to support
 
05:19:17.690 --> 05:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional actions is because
 
05:19:19.570 --> 05:19:19.580 align:start position:0%
they're getting ready to do something
 
05:19:23.090 --> 05:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
that you might kill them over
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to go there but it
 
05:19:28.368 --> 05:19:28.378 align:start position:0%
if people are supporting and trying to
 
05:19:31.190 --> 05:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
advocate for tyranny I'm not sure that
 
05:19:34.250 --> 05:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
how anybody can can condone that
 
05:19:37.208 --> 05:19:37.218 align:start position:0%
let alone a legislative body
 
05:19:40.490 --> 05:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
your job is to protect and defend our
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
rights the constitution of this state
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
and our Federal Constitution were put in
 
05:19:51.650 --> 05:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
place to limit what government can do
 
05:19:54.890 --> 05:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
our our freedoms are are a function or a
 
05:19:58.310 --> 05:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
product of the limitation of government
 
05:20:01.628 --> 05:20:01.638 align:start position:0%
it's government that infringes upon
 
05:20:05.050 --> 05:20:05.060 align:start position:0%
individual rights natural and otherwise
 
05:20:09.050 --> 05:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
and it if we read through
 
05:20:10.970 --> 05:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
depending on your familiarity of History
 
05:20:13.128 --> 05:20:13.138 align:start position:0%
well why do we have a state constitution
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
why we have a Federal Constitution it
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
was because they were afraid of the
 
05:20:19.850 --> 05:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
creation of an all-power overreaching
 
05:20:22.970 --> 05:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
central government again I.E the English
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
got cramped right so the Constitution
 
05:20:29.330 --> 05:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
has a limitation on on government I ask
 
05:20:31.390 --> 05:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
you guys to uphold your constitutional
 
05:20:33.650 --> 05:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
obligations and your oath to those
 
05:20:37.368 --> 05:20:37.378 align:start position:0%
constitutions and itl this bill
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:41.810 --> 05:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you good testimony chair recognize
 
05:20:51.050 --> 05:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.550 --> 05:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you members of the committee I
 
05:20:54.830 --> 05:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
hope you had a great lunch uh I'm glad
 
05:20:56.330 --> 05:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
you took a recess even though you ruined
 
05:20:59.930 --> 05:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
a joke my analysis said this bill delays
 
05:21:01.250 --> 05:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
lunch and I couldn't use it as
 
05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
effectively before but I thought I'd
 
05:21:03.948 --> 05:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
give it to you now
 
05:21:03.958 --> 05:21:04.788 align:start position:0%
give it to you now
um

05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:07.788 --> 05:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty simple thing and I'll
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
make it brief because I had the
 
05:21:10.550 --> 05:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
pre-lunch speech ready for you so I'll
 
05:21:11.868 --> 05:21:11.878 align:start position:0%
give you that
 
05:21:11.878 --> 05:21:12.470 align:start position:0%
give you that
um

05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:13.970 --> 05:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
you know article 7 of the State
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh State sovereignty the
 
05:21:18.110 --> 05:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
people of the state have the sole and
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
exclusive right of governing themselves
 
05:21:21.170 --> 05:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
as a free Sovereign and independent
 
05:21:23.930 --> 05:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
state and do and forever the Hereafter
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
shall exercise and enjoy every Power
 
05:21:27.288 --> 05:21:27.298 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and right pertaining here
 
05:21:29.330 --> 05:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
to which is not or may not Hereafter be
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
by them expressly delegated to the
 
05:21:32.330 --> 05:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
United States of America and Congress
 
05:21:35.810 --> 05:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
assembled June 2nd 1784 prior to the
 
05:21:37.910 --> 05:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
adoption of the U.S Constitution
 
05:21:40.128 --> 05:21:40.138 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read article 2a2 out
 
05:21:41.330 --> 05:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
here on this committee you probably know
 
05:21:43.070 --> 05:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
that but that's also very relevant to
 
05:21:45.288 --> 05:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
this and for those reasons I think it's
 
05:21:46.850 --> 05:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
very important that we as New Hampshire
 
05:21:49.610 --> 05:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
retain our identity our laws and our
 
05:21:52.250 --> 05:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
safety and keep this in place
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
um since it's been passed I have yet to
 
05:21:57.530 --> 05:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
hear a complaint other than uh I believe
 
05:21:58.910 --> 05:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
one of the complaints I heard was
 
05:22:00.650 --> 05:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
officers should be concerned about doing
 
05:22:02.990 --> 05:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
what is legal well I think that should
 
05:22:04.850 --> 05:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
be across the board no matter what they
 
05:22:06.050 --> 05:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
should always be concerned about doing
 
05:22:07.970 --> 05:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
what is legal so please
 
05:22:10.550 --> 05:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
um you know what to do with this
 
05:22:12.410 --> 05:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:14.570 --> 05:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:29.150 --> 05:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to testify
 
05:22:34.970 --> 05:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 78 today
 
05:22:38.208 --> 05:22:38.218 align:start position:0%
the intent of House Bill 78 is to repeal
 
05:22:40.250 --> 05:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
a provision in state law enacted last
 
05:22:41.990 --> 05:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
year to protect the rights of granted
 
05:22:45.050 --> 05:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
Staters from federal overreach free
 
05:22:46.730 --> 05:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
market Economist and political theorist
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
Murray rothbard in his 1982 treaties the
 
05:22:51.410 --> 05:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
ethics of Liberty offered this analogy
 
05:22:53.448 --> 05:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
for an argument which I believe best
 
05:22:56.810 --> 05:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
encapsulates the spirit of this bill
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
each of us is allowed to remain free in
 
05:23:01.128 --> 05:23:01.138 align:start position:0%
all aspects and particularly if each of
 
05:23:02.810 --> 05:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
us is allowed to retain weapons in the
 
05:23:04.970 --> 05:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
right of self-defense then surely we
 
05:23:06.410 --> 05:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
would all be at war against each other
 
05:23:08.690 --> 05:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
and society would be wrecked therefore
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
let us turn over all of our guns and all
 
05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
of our ultimate decision-making power
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
and the power to enforce our rights to
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
the Jones family over there the Jones
 
05:23:18.650 --> 05:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
family will guard us from our predatory
 
05:23:21.050 --> 05:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
instincts keep social peace and enforce
 
05:23:21.060 --> 05:23:22.490 align:start position:0%
instincts keep social peace and enforce
Justice

05:23:22.490 --> 05:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
but the Cry of who would guard us from
 
05:23:26.448 --> 05:23:26.458 align:start position:0%
the Jones family especially when we are
 
05:23:29.150 --> 05:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
deprived of our weapons suffice to shut
 
05:23:32.810 --> 05:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:35.090 --> 05:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
to regulate weapon ownership does
 
05:23:37.368 --> 05:23:37.378 align:start position:0%
nothing to make the populace safer
 
05:23:39.288 --> 05:23:39.298 align:start position:0%
instead it tips the balance of power
 
05:23:41.390 --> 05:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
away from peaceful law-abiding
 
05:23:42.770 --> 05:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
individuals who adhere to the
 
05:23:44.990 --> 05:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions and in favor of other
 
05:23:46.970 --> 05:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
unrestricted entities
 
05:23:48.708 --> 05:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
this includes not only criminals
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
possessing such weapons in violation of
 
05:23:52.430 --> 05:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
the law but the governments which insist
 
05:23:54.288 --> 05:23:54.298 align:start position:0%
on disarming their subjects
 
05:23:56.510 --> 05:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of
 
05:23:59.150 --> 05:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
1943 detainees of the ghetto stage and
 
05:24:00.830 --> 05:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
armed resistance against just such a
 
05:24:00.840 --> 05:24:01.610 align:start position:0%
armed resistance against just such a
government

05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:24:03.948 --> 05:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
in a daring bit to save their lives in
 
05:24:05.390 --> 05:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
the lives of those they loved in the
 
05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
face of impending relocation to
 
05:24:08.570 --> 05:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
concentration camps
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
roughly 700 of the 70 000 remaining
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
detainees fought to defend the ghetto
 
05:24:15.948 --> 05:24:15.958 align:start position:0%
against Nazi troops for four weeks
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
those 700 people and their weapons which
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
they were prohibited from owning by the
 
05:24:22.430 --> 05:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
government attacking them are the reason
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
there were any survivors from the Warsaw
 
05:24:26.330 --> 05:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
Ghetto at all
 
05:24:29.570 --> 05:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
years later Gerard Metro quoted one of
 
05:24:31.970 --> 05:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
those survivors in the preface to his
 
05:24:34.010 --> 05:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
book about how to build such a weapon as
 
05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
saying there was only one thing I regret
 
05:24:38.090 --> 05:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
very much that I didn't have a
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
submachine gun
 
05:24:42.288 --> 05:24:42.298 align:start position:0%
that's Metro and many others following
 
05:24:44.230 --> 05:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
in the same footsteps have ensured
 
05:24:46.490 --> 05:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
individuals will continue to have access
 
05:24:48.410 --> 05:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
to dangerous weapons whether or not the
 
05:24:50.270 --> 05:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
ownership of such weapons is forbidden
 
05:24:52.730 --> 05:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
or restricted therefore the wisest is
 
05:24:54.650 --> 05:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
safest and most civilized course of
 
05:24:56.810 --> 05:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
action is to ensure that the balance of
 
05:24:58.610 --> 05:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
power is kept equal
 
05:25:00.708 --> 05:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
By ignoring the Second Amendment to its
 
05:25:02.628 --> 05:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
Constitution and enacting such laws as
 
05:25:04.730 --> 05:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
the National Firearms Act the federal
 
05:25:06.890 --> 05:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
government has violated the restrictions
 
05:25:09.770 --> 05:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
it placed for itself on its power our
 
05:25:11.570 --> 05:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
legislature should continue to assert
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
the rights of granite Staters against
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
this Federal overreach because it is
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
only the assertion of our rights that
 
05:25:18.230 --> 05:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
preserves them
 
05:25:20.510 --> 05:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
for this reason I urge the committee to
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
consider House Bill 78 and expedient to
 
05:25:22.798 --> 05:25:25.310 align:start position:0%
consider House Bill 78 and expedient to
legislate

05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:25:33.410 --> 05:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:33.420 --> 05:25:36.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:25:36.430 --> 05:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
before I begin my testimony will be
 
05:25:40.128 --> 05:25:40.138 align:start position:0%
quick but
 
05:25:42.530 --> 05:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
um since the original bill that this is
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
trying to reverse was passed I don't
 
05:25:46.190 --> 05:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
know of any firearm scaler who wasn't
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
still using ATF Form 4473 to conduct a
 
05:25:52.490 --> 05:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
background check and um before they sell
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
a firearm right on form 4473
 
05:26:00.110 --> 05:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
it says under question 21 Section 8 H
 
05:26:02.090 --> 05:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
have you ever been adjudicated as a
 
05:26:04.430 --> 05:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
mental defective or have you ever been
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
committed to a mental institution for
 
05:26:08.208 --> 05:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
those who don't understand what
 
05:26:10.128 --> 05:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
adjudicated as a mental defective mean
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
that means a court of law mandated a
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
person gets inpatient or outpatient
 
05:26:17.570 --> 05:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment that person is a
 
05:26:20.270 --> 05:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited person if you lie on any of
 
05:26:22.190 --> 05:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
the questions on this form you commit a
 
05:26:22.200 --> 05:26:23.390 align:start position:0%
the questions on this form you commit a
felony

05:26:23.390 --> 05:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
felony
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
the adjudication in the court of law
 
05:26:27.050 --> 05:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
shows up on the background check
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clear that up
 
05:26:31.368 --> 05:26:31.378 align:start position:0%
um this is the second piece of
 
05:26:32.930 --> 05:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
legislation we've seen this year where
 
05:26:34.550 --> 05:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
legislators who are supposed to
 
05:26:36.770 --> 05:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
represent granted Staters are either
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
begging the federal government to
 
05:26:40.070 --> 05:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
infringe upon our Second Amendment
 
05:26:42.050 --> 05:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
rights or demanding that the state
 
05:26:44.628 --> 05:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
legislature not protect our Second
 
05:26:46.550 --> 05:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights from an overreaching
 
05:26:48.530 --> 05:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
federal government this one's pretty
 
05:26:50.810 --> 05:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
easy please vote in expedient to
 
05:26:53.330 --> 05:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
legislate on this bill this legislature
 
05:26:55.550 --> 05:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
is supposed to represent Granite Staters
 
05:26:57.470 --> 05:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
not the federal government no matter
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
who's in office thank you
 
05:27:00.240 --> 05:27:02.470 align:start position:0%
who's in office thank you
foreign

05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:23.090 --> 05:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:23.100 --> 05:27:35.690 align:start position:0%
 
ude

05:27:35.690 --> 05:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:37.368 --> 05:27:37.378 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
05:27:42.350 --> 05:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee I'm asking you itl HB 78 and
 
05:27:44.030 --> 05:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
first you have to look at what problem
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
are we looking to solve those who
 
05:27:48.288 --> 05:27:48.298 align:start position:0%
suggested it's unconstitutional there's
 
05:27:49.788 --> 05:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
nobody borrowing them from the courtroom
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
doors if they believe it's
 
05:27:53.330 --> 05:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional let them walk into
 
05:27:55.250 --> 05:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
court and find out
 
05:27:57.470 --> 05:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is that you have to
 
05:28:00.170 --> 05:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
look at is what are we trying to fix
 
05:28:02.448 --> 05:28:02.458 align:start position:0%
we're asking them specifically to follow
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
the law and we're telling them more
 
05:28:05.520 --> 05:28:07.250 align:start position:0%
the law and we're telling them more
importantly

05:28:07.250 --> 05:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
05:28:09.590 --> 05:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
that federal law enforcement officers
 
05:28:11.690 --> 05:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
can't come in and order New Hampshire
 
05:28:13.550 --> 05:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers around like
 
05:28:13.560 --> 05:28:14.868 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers around like
dogs

05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
05:28:16.610 --> 05:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
and that's really what we've had before
 
05:28:19.070 --> 05:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
and this allows
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
regular Rank and file Law Enforcement
 
05:28:25.430 --> 05:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
Officers to essentially refuse unlawful
 
05:28:28.250 --> 05:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
orders and it allows them a shield from
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
05:28:31.550 --> 05:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
because you have some at least in this
 
05:28:34.368 --> 05:28:34.378 align:start position:0%
state the police Chiefs Association is
 
05:28:36.410 --> 05:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
one of the most anti-gun associations
 
05:28:39.650 --> 05:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
we've ever seen every time we are at the
 
05:28:42.170 --> 05:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
state house if there's a pro firearm
 
05:28:44.510 --> 05:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
Bill Chiefs are usually against it if
 
05:28:46.430 --> 05:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
there's an anti-firm Bill Chiefs are
 
05:28:48.170 --> 05:28:48.180 align:start position:0%
usually for it and you have to
 
05:28:49.970 --> 05:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
understand those are the people that
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
order the rank and file around
 
05:28:56.448 --> 05:28:56.458 align:start position:0%
and this law gives Rank and file an
 
05:28:58.850 --> 05:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity to follow the law
 
05:29:01.490 --> 05:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
but here's the bottom line we have a
 
05:29:03.650 --> 05:29:03.660 align:start position:0%
governor that can order state workers
 
05:29:06.590 --> 05:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
state employees state troopers to do
 
05:29:09.770 --> 05:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
within the laws he chooses if he wants
 
05:29:12.110 --> 05:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
state troopers to help the feds he can
 
05:29:14.868 --> 05:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
ask them to but what you have here
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
anyone who's been out in any type of
 
05:29:18.830 --> 05:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
scene there's a hierarchy on scenes
 
05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
usually in an accident scene technically
 
05:29:24.948 --> 05:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
the highest ranking Fire officer is The
 
05:29:27.230 --> 05:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
Incident Commander but as a practical
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
matter they tend to be a little bit
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
different people and sometimes they
 
05:29:32.750 --> 05:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
allow Weber's ranking officer of police
 
05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
there to basically run the scene
 
05:29:36.890 --> 05:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
and that's what how it works is a
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
practical matter but the bottom line is
 
05:29:40.550 --> 05:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
just because the feds come into certain
 
05:29:43.850 --> 05:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
areas and run their operations doesn't
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
mean that we should be kowtowing to them
 
05:29:48.830 --> 05:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
and more importantly it's really an
 
05:29:51.708 --> 05:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate and the question is do
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
you want your tax dollars used the way
 
05:29:55.730 --> 05:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
you think your officials are using them
 
05:29:57.948 --> 05:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
or do you want them used the way the
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
feds come in and tell you and so we look
 
05:30:03.410 --> 05:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
at this and you haven't heard one person
 
05:30:06.170 --> 05:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
talk about one instance where this law
 
05:30:07.970 --> 05:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
has been a problem
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
so you ask yourself why would I want to
 
05:30:12.770 --> 05:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
itl it when there's not one problem not
 
05:30:15.230 --> 05:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
one Incident That's come up
 
05:30:18.288 --> 05:30:18.298 align:start position:0%
and we heard one person say well you
 
05:30:21.288 --> 05:30:21.298 align:start position:0%
know I have this fear about this or I
 
05:30:23.090 --> 05:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
worry about this
 
05:30:25.550 --> 05:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna change a law that hasn't
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
caused any problem because one person
 
05:30:29.448 --> 05:30:29.458 align:start position:0%
has a fear or concern
 
05:30:31.368 --> 05:30:31.378 align:start position:0%
and they can't articulate what
 
05:30:33.170 --> 05:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
specifically that fear of concern is
 
05:30:33.180 --> 05:30:34.250 align:start position:0%
specifically that fear of concern is
about

05:30:34.250 --> 05:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:30:36.770 --> 05:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
I'm back to connecting the dots you've
 
05:30:39.170 --> 05:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
got to say this is my fear this is what
 
05:30:40.490 --> 05:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think will happen
 
05:30:43.250 --> 05:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
and it just hasn't happened in a decade
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
or so so the question you have to ask
 
05:30:47.868 --> 05:30:47.878 align:start position:0%
yourself is why do we want to repeal
 
05:30:50.270 --> 05:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
something that's working
 
05:30:53.208 --> 05:30:53.218 align:start position:0%
and I go back to the fact that the
 
05:30:55.250 --> 05:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
governor and all sorts of authorities
 
05:30:58.490 --> 05:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs everyone can offer joint
 
05:30:59.690 --> 05:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
ventures there's all sorts of other
 
05:31:02.030 --> 05:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
things that can happen but the bottom
 
05:31:04.010 --> 05:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
line is we're not their lackeys and we
 
05:31:05.510 --> 05:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
05:31:07.128 --> 05:31:07.138 align:start position:0%
we're equal
 
05:31:08.990 --> 05:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's the bottom line is even though
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
federal law has Supremacy when you talk
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
about the 10th Amendment and stuff where
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
equal group of states
 
05:31:17.930 --> 05:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any mechanical
 
05:31:22.490 --> 05:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:25.250 --> 05:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
05:31:27.830 --> 05:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
at this point I'll be closing the public
 
05:31:30.430 --> 05:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
05:31:35.150 --> 05:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
78 oh we have one more you turn in a
 
05:31:37.730 --> 05:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:40.070 --> 05:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
sir did you turn in a pink card I
 
05:31:42.288 --> 05:31:42.298 align:start position:0%
apologize Mr chairman I do not believe I
 
05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
did but based on what I've heard I beg
 
05:31:48.350 --> 05:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
your Indulgence
 
05:31:49.910 --> 05:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
um sure when you're finished testifying
 
05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
I need you to fill in a pin card please
 
05:31:53.150 --> 05:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
keep it short and succinct
 
05:31:57.230 --> 05:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'll do my very best I owe you that
 
05:32:00.830 --> 05:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
the reason to itl this bill is summed up
 
05:32:06.230 --> 05:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
in three words Gregory Peter DuPont
 
05:32:09.250 --> 05:32:09.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Dupont native of Massachusetts
 
05:32:13.368 --> 05:32:13.378 align:start position:0%
convicted of oui in Massachusetts in
 
05:32:13.378 --> 05:32:14.990 align:start position:0%
convicted of oui in Massachusetts in
1999

05:32:14.990 --> 05:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
1999
 
05:32:18.170 --> 05:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
that conviction could have brought a
 
05:32:19.730 --> 05:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
sentence of up to two and a half years
 
05:32:22.730 --> 05:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
in prison as no one was hurt and there
 
05:32:25.070 --> 05:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
was no property damage there was no
 
05:32:27.708 --> 05:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
prison sentence but the potential
 
05:32:32.448 --> 05:32:32.458 align:start position:0%
sentence made him federally prohibited
 
05:32:36.070 --> 05:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
in 2004 the Massachusetts General Court
 
05:32:39.050 --> 05:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
specifically created a Firearms
 
05:32:42.610 --> 05:32:42.620 align:start position:0%
licensing review board to consider
 
05:32:48.890 --> 05:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
persons who had run afoul of the DUI Law
 
05:32:53.628 --> 05:32:53.638 align:start position:0%
and it authorizes board to restore the
 
05:32:56.270 --> 05:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
Civil Right to be armed of such persons
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
if after an evidentiary hearing the
 
05:33:02.390 --> 05:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
person proved to the board that they had
 
05:33:05.330 --> 05:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
changed their ways and had
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're not going to reoffend Mr Dupont
 
05:33:10.910 --> 05:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
went before the board he convinced the
 
05:33:13.250 --> 05:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
board to
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
issue a letter saying that he was
 
05:33:19.010 --> 05:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
eligible to be armed and he could apply
 
05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
for a license the board was not then and
 
05:33:25.730 --> 05:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
is not now an issuer of licenses he
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire he sought a
 
05:33:30.770 --> 05:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
pistol and revolve her license he sought
 
05:33:33.708 --> 05:33:33.718 align:start position:0%
an armed security guard license he fully
 
05:33:36.830 --> 05:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
improperly disclosed
 
05:33:39.770 --> 05:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
that he had been convicted and provided
 
05:33:41.990 --> 05:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
proof that his civil right to be armed
 
05:33:45.230 --> 05:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
had been restored I know these things
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
because as a non-attorney representative
 
05:33:50.208 --> 05:33:50.218 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
05:33:54.170 --> 05:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
graciously allowed me to appear as a
 
05:33:54.180 --> 05:33:55.610 align:start position:0%
graciously allowed me to appear as a
non-attorney

05:33:55.610 --> 05:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
non-attorney
 
05:33:57.350 --> 05:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
before it
 
05:33:57.360 --> 05:33:58.570 align:start position:0%
before it
because

05:33:58.570 --> 05:33:58.580 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
Mr DuPont's licenses were revoked
 
05:34:06.288 --> 05:34:06.298 align:start position:0%
on the basis of the Massachusetts
 
05:34:06.298 --> 05:34:08.270 align:start position:0%
on the basis of the Massachusetts
conviction

05:34:08.270 --> 05:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
05:34:11.208 --> 05:34:11.218 align:start position:0%
I think the feds had a hand in that they
 
05:34:14.090 --> 05:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
could have prosecuted Mr Dupont on their
 
05:34:14.100 --> 05:34:14.810 align:start position:0%
could have prosecuted Mr Dupont on their
own

05:34:14.810 --> 05:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
own
 
05:34:17.448 --> 05:34:17.458 align:start position:0%
but Folks at Nashua police department
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm ashamed to say our own
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety revoked his
 
05:34:21.840 --> 05:34:24.708 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety revoked his
licenses

05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:26.930 --> 05:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
the licenses were shared under separate
 
05:34:30.230 --> 05:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
laws there were two separate cases
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
that he brought
 
05:34:35.690 --> 05:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
armed security guards don't make a
 
05:34:37.368 --> 05:34:37.378 align:start position:0%
fortune and when his armed security
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
guard license was revoked
 
05:34:42.590 --> 05:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
it broke his race book slashed his
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
income so
 
05:34:47.868 --> 05:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
I stepped forward
 
05:34:47.878 --> 05:34:49.690 align:start position:0%
I stepped forward
to

05:34:49.690 --> 05:34:49.700 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:34:52.610 --> 05:34:52.620 align:start position:0%
file a brief on his behalf of the New
 
05:34:54.890 --> 05:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court and to argue his
 
05:34:58.190 --> 05:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
cause a very kind attorney
 
05:35:00.830 --> 05:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
stepped up pro bono
 
05:35:00.840 --> 05:35:02.270 align:start position:0%
stepped up pro bono
to

05:35:02.270 --> 05:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:35:05.690 --> 05:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
appeal the other revocation now here's
 
05:35:09.170 --> 05:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
The Clincher New Hampshire had no
 
05:35:09.180 --> 05:35:10.750 align:start position:0%
The Clincher New Hampshire had no
interest

05:35:10.750 --> 05:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
interest
 
05:35:13.788 --> 05:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
in those reputations
 
05:35:16.430 --> 05:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
we could have we meaning Department of
 
05:35:19.788 --> 05:35:19.798 align:start position:0%
Safety a national PD could have accepted
 
05:35:22.510 --> 05:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
the action of the Massachusetts
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
Firearms licensing review board they did
 
05:35:25.680 --> 05:35:27.288 align:start position:0%
Firearms licensing review board they did
not

05:35:27.288 --> 05:35:27.298 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:35:29.330 --> 05:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
and as a result
 
05:35:31.788 --> 05:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
the matter went through district court
 
05:35:34.970 --> 05:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
for his pistol and revolver license at
 
05:35:37.670 --> 05:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
Superior Court for his armed security
 
05:35:41.650 --> 05:35:41.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:45.650 --> 05:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
were if you will
 
05:35:48.590 --> 05:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
I guess prosecuted by the state on the
 
05:35:52.910 --> 05:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
basis well if we let Mr Dupont acquire
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
Firearms by respecting the Massachusetts
 
05:35:59.090 --> 05:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
decision our employees New Hampshire
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
state employees might be prosecuted
 
05:36:05.750 --> 05:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
I thought that was a joke then I think
 
05:36:08.270 --> 05:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's still a joke okay
 
05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court issued
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
an extraordinarily strong and favorable
 
05:36:16.610 --> 05:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
decision restoring Mr DuPont's licenses
 
05:36:18.350 --> 05:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
so you think that's the end of the
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
matter no someone in the AG's office I
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
do not know who
 
05:36:28.430 --> 05:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
decided to seek review by the U.S
 
05:36:31.730 --> 05:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court with a view to overturning
 
05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
with a view to overturning the New
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court decision
 
05:36:39.470 --> 05:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
maybe that person wanted to Curry favor
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
with the feds but this is a real life
 
05:36:47.330 --> 05:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
example of what happens when the feds
 
05:36:51.050 --> 05:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
and the state decide to team up in this
 
05:36:52.490 --> 05:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
case against someone who had done
 
05:36:54.590 --> 05:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong who had been totally
 
05:36:58.788 --> 05:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
honest with his licensors throughout
 
05:37:02.170 --> 05:37:02.180 align:start position:0%
so to repeal
 
05:37:06.288 --> 05:37:06.298 align:start position:0%
the statuted issue would be to encourage
 
05:37:09.230 --> 05:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
further abuse of this sort just for the
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
record as a non-attorney representative
 
05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
I could not by Court rule and therefore
 
05:37:19.788 --> 05:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
did not charge Mr Dupont even a penny so
 
05:37:23.930 --> 05:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
I met the cost of copying filing fees
 
05:37:28.190 --> 05:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
out of my own pocket because I thought
 
05:37:31.550 --> 05:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
what department of safety and Nashua
 
05:37:35.690 --> 05:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
Pete did to him was just plain wrong
 
05:37:38.330 --> 05:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
so the idea that you know this is sort
 
05:37:41.650 --> 05:37:41.660 align:start position:0%
of theoretical no it isn't theoretical
 
05:37:44.990 --> 05:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's happened you can google and find
 
05:37:46.430 --> 05:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
the decision
 
05:37:49.670 --> 05:37:49.680 align:start position:0%

and testimony is unfortunately becoming
 
05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
close to being repetitive so I would
 
05:38:23.448 --> 05:38:23.458 align:start position:0%

05:42:02.510 --> 05:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
would do because this is a a nine page
 
05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill it's very long it's very
 
05:42:05.990 --> 05:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
complicated and it has quite a history
 
05:42:07.970 --> 05:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
because I thought I just might spend
 
05:42:10.490 --> 05:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
some time going through what the bill
 
05:42:13.128 --> 05:42:13.138 align:start position:0%
does and and what it doesn't do
 
05:42:15.830 --> 05:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
so as quickly as I can
 
05:42:17.448 --> 05:42:17.458 align:start position:0%
um lender the bill law enforcement
 
05:42:19.368 --> 05:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
officers and family or household members
 
05:42:21.708 --> 05:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who recognize warning
 
05:42:24.770 --> 05:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
signs of danger could enlist the help of
 
05:42:28.550 --> 05:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
a court in filing a petition uh to issue
 
05:42:31.490 --> 05:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
an extreme risk protection order
 
05:42:34.190 --> 05:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
unlike our domestic violence or stalking
 
05:42:36.770 --> 05:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
protective order process the procedure
 
05:42:39.830 --> 05:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
for seeking an herbal order is a civil
 
05:42:42.288 --> 05:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
versus a criminal process that focuses
 
05:42:44.510 --> 05:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
solely on limiting a person's access to
 
05:42:48.170 --> 05:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
Firearms if they are found to be an
 
05:42:50.150 --> 05:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
immediate threat to themselves or to
 
05:42:50.160 --> 05:42:51.110 align:start position:0%
immediate threat to themselves or to
others

05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
others
 
05:42:53.810 --> 05:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
under the bill Law Enforcement Officers
 
05:42:56.030 --> 05:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
family or household members and intimate
 
05:42:58.190 --> 05:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
partners of the respondent can petition
 
05:42:59.810 --> 05:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
for an order
 
05:43:02.150 --> 05:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
there are two types of herpos that can
 
05:43:05.150 --> 05:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
be that can actually be issued a
 
05:43:07.788 --> 05:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
temporary order and a final order
 
05:43:10.128 --> 05:43:10.138 align:start position:0%
a temporary order can be issued in
 
05:43:12.410 --> 05:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
emergency situations if a judge finds
 
05:43:14.330 --> 05:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
there is reasonable cause to believe
 
05:43:17.090 --> 05:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
that the respondent poses a significant
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
risk of causing personal injury to
 
05:43:20.868 --> 05:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
himself or herself in the immediate
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
future by having access to firearms and
 
05:43:23.520 --> 05:43:24.830 align:start position:0%
future by having access to firearms and
ammunition

05:43:24.830 --> 05:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
ammunition
 
05:43:27.948 --> 05:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
in urgent situations the order can also
 
05:43:30.948 --> 05:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
be issued ex-party that is without
 
05:43:33.288 --> 05:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
notice to either side and before a full
 
05:43:36.050 --> 05:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
hearing but ex parte orders are only
 
05:43:38.570 --> 05:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
issued when circumstance I'm sorry when
 
05:43:41.090 --> 05:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
circumstances pose a real risk that
 
05:43:43.368 --> 05:43:43.378 align:start position:0%
irreparable harm will result if the
 
05:43:45.048 --> 05:43:45.058 align:start position:0%
judge doesn't take immediate action
 
05:43:47.510 --> 05:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
without hearing from all of the decides
 
05:43:50.090 --> 05:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
in this in this in the dispute
 
05:43:52.490 --> 05:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
temporary orders can last no longer than
 
05:43:54.890 --> 05:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
seven days and after that time the court
 
05:43:57.590 --> 05:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
must hold a full hearing at which time
 
05:43:59.810 --> 05:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
all parties have the opportunity to
 
05:44:01.628 --> 05:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
appear and present evidence
 
05:44:03.708 --> 05:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
respondents who are subject to a
 
05:44:05.330 --> 05:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
temporary europeo can request an
 
05:44:07.548 --> 05:44:07.558 align:start position:0%
expedited hearing which must take place
 
05:44:09.590 --> 05:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
within three to five days of their
 
05:44:09.600 --> 05:44:10.730 align:start position:0%
within three to five days of their
request

05:44:10.730 --> 05:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:44:13.368 --> 05:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
the temporary order automatically
 
05:44:15.708 --> 05:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
expires on the hearing date for the
 
05:44:16.910 --> 05:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
final order
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
if granted the final order can remain in
 
05:44:22.250 --> 05:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
effect for no more than one year and can
 
05:44:24.048 --> 05:44:24.058 align:start position:0%
only be issued after notice to the
 
05:44:26.090 --> 05:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
respondent in a full hearing at which
 
05:44:28.368 --> 05:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
all parties have the opportunity to be
 
05:44:28.378 --> 05:44:29.510 align:start position:0%
all parties have the opportunity to be
heard

05:44:29.510 --> 05:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:44:31.788 --> 05:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
vital orders can only be issued if the
 
05:44:33.350 --> 05:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
court finds there is clear and
 
05:44:34.850 --> 05:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence
 
05:44:37.490 --> 05:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
that will respondent poses a significant
 
05:44:39.470 --> 05:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
risk of causing personal injury to
 
05:44:42.410 --> 05:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
himself or to others by having access to
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
firearms and ammunition
 
05:44:47.090 --> 05:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
the court also has the option during the
 
05:44:49.250 --> 05:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
final hearing to order a mental health
 
05:44:52.490 --> 05:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
or chemical dependency evaluation
 
05:44:55.730 --> 05:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
throughout the process the person asking
 
05:44:57.948 --> 05:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
for the order Bears the burden of
 
05:44:59.948 --> 05:44:59.958 align:start position:0%
proving based on all relevant evidence
 
05:45:02.868 --> 05:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
that the respondent poses a serious
 
05:45:04.970 --> 05:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
threat to themselves or to others by
 
05:45:07.190 --> 05:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
having firearms representative I'm going
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
to have to stop you at that point I'll
 
05:45:10.128 --> 05:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
let you go a little over to two minutes
 
05:45:12.170 --> 05:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
I will however give you as much time as
 
05:45:13.670 --> 05:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
you like during the executive decision
 
05:45:15.530 --> 05:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
to address us
 
05:45:16.970 --> 05:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
um so we're gonna have to move on to the
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:21.708 --> 05:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
thank you at this point
 
05:45:28.310 --> 05:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:30.350 --> 05:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and find committee
 
05:45:33.288 --> 05:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
members I oppose this bill as I always
 
05:45:33.298 --> 05:45:34.430 align:start position:0%
members I oppose this bill as I always
have

05:45:34.430 --> 05:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:45:36.708 --> 05:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
it seems to keep coming back like a bad
 
05:45:36.718 --> 05:45:38.990 align:start position:0%
it seems to keep coming back like a bad
penny

05:45:38.990 --> 05:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
penny
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest reasons I oppose this
 
05:45:44.270 --> 05:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
is because I'm from the old Vermont
 
05:45:45.948 --> 05:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
not the Vermont today but the old
 
05:45:48.110 --> 05:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont that used to be there
 
05:45:51.770 --> 05:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
the new Vermont has this in a few of my
 
05:45:54.110 --> 05:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
friends have been caught up in this with
 
05:45:58.128 --> 05:45:58.138 align:start position:0%
an X that has a grind you know you know
 
05:46:00.410 --> 05:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
to get back at them they'll make up
 
05:46:02.570 --> 05:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
something and let's go to the punishment
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
of this if you make up a lie
 
05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't exist
 
05:46:10.190 --> 05:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
because when I sat on your committee
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
criminal justice when a policeman came
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
up once I asked him
 
05:46:17.390 --> 05:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
what's the chances of you Prosecuting he
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
said zero
 
05:46:22.250 --> 05:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
because you can't know the intent of the
 
05:46:23.930 --> 05:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
person you can't prove that they're
 
05:46:26.330 --> 05:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
lying I mean sometimes you can but they
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
still just won't prosecute anybody that
 
05:46:35.270 --> 05:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:38.090 --> 05:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
the other reason I'm against this is you
 
05:46:41.270 --> 05:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
know I think most of you know who I am
 
05:46:44.090 --> 05:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I I have a huge Target on my back
 
05:46:45.948 --> 05:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
and you know there's some people that
 
05:46:47.570 --> 05:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
don't like me for some reason and I
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't understand why
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
but there is they would love to have
 
05:46:53.160 --> 05:46:54.170 align:start position:0%
but there is they would love to have
this

05:46:54.170 --> 05:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:46:56.570 --> 05:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
to make up some stuff on me and take my
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
guns because I'm very vocal about my
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
guns that I have
 
05:47:02.690 --> 05:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
until I had the boat accident of course
 
05:47:06.288 --> 05:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
they're all gone now but people want to
 
05:47:09.650 --> 05:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
to you know harm certain people there
 
05:47:11.628 --> 05:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
are certain crazy people out in this
 
05:47:11.638 --> 05:47:13.070 align:start position:0%
are certain crazy people out in this
community

05:47:13.070 --> 05:47:13.080 align:start position:0%

05:47:21.048 --> 05:47:21.058 align:start position:0%
make up something on me or other people
 
05:47:25.250 --> 05:47:25.260 align:start position:0%

05:47:27.470 --> 05:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
do thank you please oppose this I tell

05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:48.948 --> 05:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:51.590 --> 05:47:51.600 align:start position:0%

bill itl we've tested mode testified
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
many times on this bill it's not con
 
05:48:00.590 --> 05:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's not consistent with the
 
05:48:03.288 --> 05:48:03.298 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States nor is
 
05:48:05.810 --> 05:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
it consistent with the constitution of
 
05:48:08.448 --> 05:48:08.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire article 20 clearly states
 
05:48:11.330 --> 05:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
in a Civil Trial that involves uh
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
property exceeding fifteen hundred
 
05:48:15.048 --> 05:48:15.058 align:start position:0%
dollars that person has a right to a
 
05:48:16.250 --> 05:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
jury trial
 
05:48:21.410 --> 05:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill will accuse try and
 
05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
convict and apply punishment without the
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
party ever being made aware let alone
 
05:48:31.250 --> 05:48:31.260 align:start position:0%

05:48:34.850 --> 05:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
witness or defend themselves in no way
 
05:48:36.430 --> 05:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
shape or form is this bill
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional or lawful as we see and
 
05:48:43.788 --> 05:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
you will hear I'm sure others testify
 
05:48:46.788 --> 05:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh our our current existing ex parte
 
05:48:50.170 --> 05:48:50.180 align:start position:0%
laws are used as a matter of of course
 
05:48:53.570 --> 05:48:53.580 align:start position:0%

05:48:56.208 --> 05:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
they're abused regularly there are no
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
consequences to it the courts don't even
 
05:49:03.490 --> 05:49:03.500 align:start position:0%
try to prosecute it we have no data
 
05:49:06.048 --> 05:49:06.058 align:start position:0%
quantifying the problem but any lawyer
 
05:49:08.448 --> 05:49:08.458 align:start position:0%
that practices family law will tell you
 
05:49:10.430 --> 05:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
as a matter of course they're abused on
 
05:49:12.110 --> 05:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
a regular basis
 
05:49:14.448 --> 05:49:14.458 align:start position:0%
New York State the New York state
 
05:49:17.030 --> 05:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
supreme court just invalidated declared
 
05:49:20.170 --> 05:49:20.180 align:start position:0%
an unconstitutional their emergency
 
05:49:22.128 --> 05:49:22.138 align:start position:0%
protective order
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
are we really going to go down that
 
05:49:27.110 --> 05:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
route too especially in light of the the
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
Bruin decision at the Supreme Court
 
05:49:32.390 --> 05:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
which is cast doubt on pretty much all
 
05:49:33.708 --> 05:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
of these laws
 
05:49:37.128 --> 05:49:37.138 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's uh it's a
 
05:49:40.310 --> 05:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
a good place to go thank you
 
05:49:42.288 --> 05:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
05:49:55.150 --> 05:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
Kathy Holmes Chichester I'm against this
 
05:49:59.040 --> 05:50:00.890 align:start position:0%
Kathy Holmes Chichester I'm against this
bill

05:50:00.890 --> 05:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:50:05.448 --> 05:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
and the main point you'll find in my
 
05:50:09.190 --> 05:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
orange box there the actual law breaker
 
05:50:12.350 --> 05:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
accuses the innocent and gets away with
 
05:50:15.530 --> 05:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
it again and again they use the system
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
to suit a myriad of purposes and this
 
05:50:22.368 --> 05:50:22.378 align:start position:0%
happened to me and then my husband just
 
05:50:22.378 --> 05:50:23.770 align:start position:0%
happened to me and then my husband just
because

05:50:23.770 --> 05:50:23.780 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:50:27.830 --> 05:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
is by proxy
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh we had a past tenant
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
long 10-year court case got the Judgment
 
05:50:37.970 --> 05:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
10 years previously they owed us twelve
 
05:50:40.610 --> 05:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars pure rent just to keep
 
05:50:43.970 --> 05:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit simple we left out damages
 
05:50:45.770 --> 05:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
pure rent
 
05:50:48.948 --> 05:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
and over the course of their
 
05:50:52.310 --> 05:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
manipulations and lying and uh they got
 
05:50:56.208 --> 05:50:56.218 align:start position:0%
warrants for their arrest we uh well we
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
were a thorn in their side
 
05:51:01.490 --> 05:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
and how convenient when I was substitute
 
05:51:05.150 --> 05:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
teaching in Concord happened to be in
 
05:51:07.010 --> 05:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
this their second grade girls class I
 
05:51:09.048 --> 05:51:09.058 align:start position:0%
don't even know the last names when
 
05:51:10.788 --> 05:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
you're subbing you don't know people's
 
05:51:13.490 --> 05:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
last names but
 
05:51:16.430 --> 05:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
um So within a flash
 
05:51:19.610 --> 05:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
we I was accused of stalking
 
05:51:22.730 --> 05:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
and they were afraid
 
05:51:25.250 --> 05:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
what might I do
 
05:51:25.260 --> 05:51:26.628 align:start position:0%
what might I do
so

05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:29.690 --> 05:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
we got the bad advice from the police oh
 
05:51:33.548 --> 05:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
ask for an expedited hearing oh we did
 
05:51:37.010 --> 05:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
and but yet we weren't heard
 
05:51:39.170 --> 05:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
and we tried to bring up what the
 
05:51:41.868 --> 05:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
situation was the judge said I can't
 
05:51:44.208 --> 05:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
hear that that was a previous that's
 
05:51:46.190 --> 05:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
another case
 
05:51:48.288 --> 05:51:48.298 align:start position:0%
when I asked why won't they be arrested
 
05:51:50.930 --> 05:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
I can't hear that
 
05:51:54.890 --> 05:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
so my husband lost the guns and I lost
 
05:51:56.650 --> 05:51:56.660 align:start position:0%
my job
 
05:52:00.048 --> 05:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
and because we asked for that expedited
 
05:52:02.390 --> 05:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
hearing we had to go to the New
 
05:52:04.730 --> 05:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court that was our
 
05:52:07.970 --> 05:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
only recourse expensive
 
05:52:11.448 --> 05:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
and here this tenant over the years they
 
05:52:14.810 --> 05:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
were living in our property that was a
 
05:52:17.288 --> 05:52:17.298 align:start position:0%
proven liar we
 
05:52:20.090 --> 05:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
time and time again Liars lie and they
 
05:52:23.510 --> 05:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
keep on lying man at this time I have to
 
05:52:25.430 --> 05:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
cut you off at two minutes
 
05:52:27.470 --> 05:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
um we will we do have that and we
 
05:52:29.448 --> 05:52:29.458 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and if any of the members
 
05:52:31.250 --> 05:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
would like to ask further questions
 
05:52:34.368 --> 05:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
um you can approach bottom to verify my
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
testimony by the court case you can look
 
05:52:38.570 --> 05:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
it up I will and I appreciate that thank
 
05:52:40.490 --> 05:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
05:52:42.530 --> 05:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
and again the chair hates to have to cut
 
05:52:44.150 --> 05:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
anybody off but there's just only so
 
05:52:46.070 --> 05:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
many that's left in the day
 
05:52:50.208 --> 05:52:50.218 align:start position:0%
um the chair recognizes
 
05:52:54.590 --> 05:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:02.990 --> 05:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again for hearing my testimony
 
05:53:05.810 --> 05:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
as a psychiatrist I have witnessed many
 
05:53:09.430 --> 05:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
05:53:12.670 --> 05:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
individuals with serious mental illness
 
05:53:16.250 --> 05:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
are suicidal
 
05:53:18.770 --> 05:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
um sometimes even homicidal and there's
 
05:53:22.730 --> 05:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
no actions really that we can take until
 
05:53:22.740 --> 05:53:23.890 align:start position:0%
no actions really that we can take until
after

05:53:23.890 --> 05:53:23.900 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:53:28.850 --> 05:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh some violent episode takes place
 
05:53:34.610 --> 05:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
23 days ago I attended a funeral
 
05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
of a 26 year old young man who I used to
 
05:53:41.208 --> 05:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
treat I still treat his mother
 
05:53:46.368 --> 05:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
and she knew that her son was very
 
05:53:46.378 --> 05:53:47.708 align:start position:0%
and she knew that her son was very
paranoid

05:53:47.708 --> 05:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
paranoid
 
05:53:51.170 --> 05:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
and was a potential danger to himself
 
05:53:53.150 --> 05:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
but she could do nothing
 
05:53:56.448 --> 05:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
and she told me at the funeral how sad
 
05:53:58.850 --> 05:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
she was that she could do nothing to
 
05:54:03.530 --> 05:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
prevent his impulsive act this
 
05:54:03.540 --> 05:54:04.810 align:start position:0%
prevent his impulsive act this
bill

05:54:04.810 --> 05:54:04.820 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:54:08.150 --> 05:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
a so-called red flag law
 
05:54:12.948 --> 05:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
are present in 19 States and they have
 
05:54:17.090 --> 05:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
reduced suicide in particular and I
 
05:54:20.570 --> 05:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
encourage you all to consider passing
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
this law so that we can do something to
 
05:54:27.350 --> 05:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
prevent mostly suicide but also
 
05:54:31.930 --> 05:54:31.940 align:start position:0%
potentially homicide thank you very much
 
05:54:40.610 --> 05:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:44.510 --> 05:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you George R jurik g-u-r-i-c-k Jr
 
05:54:48.708 --> 05:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
I live in Farmington New Hampshire
 
05:54:51.650 --> 05:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
I live in Farmington New Hampshire and I
 
05:54:55.128 --> 05:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
represent no one except myself
 
05:54:59.570 --> 05:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
the uh treating House Bill 106 is a red
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
flag law is entirely appropriate but
 
05:55:06.110 --> 05:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
what is
 
05:55:06.120 --> 05:55:07.548 align:start position:0%
what is
um

05:55:07.548 --> 05:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:11.030 --> 05:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
in my research missing from many of
 
05:55:14.930 --> 05:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
these is the consideration for what is
 
05:55:18.770 --> 05:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
called in New in American criminal law
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
state of mind
 
05:55:26.090 --> 05:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
and before the fact to bedrock
 
05:55:29.330 --> 05:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
principles and American criminal law
 
05:55:32.090 --> 05:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
before the fact
 
05:55:35.570 --> 05:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
in many applications to seize a person's
 
05:55:38.990 --> 05:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
private property under red flag laws
 
05:55:41.030 --> 05:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the person's
 
05:55:43.310 --> 05:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
background that they are convicted of
 
05:55:43.320 --> 05:55:44.510 align:start position:0%
background that they are convicted of
crime

05:55:44.510 --> 05:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
crime
 
05:55:47.930 --> 05:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
did a crime or anything else
 
05:55:50.270 --> 05:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
before the fact
 
05:55:53.650 --> 05:55:53.660 align:start position:0%
also to secure a conviction in
 
05:55:56.750 --> 05:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and felonies the
 
05:55:56.760 --> 05:55:58.850 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and felonies the
prosecution

05:55:58.850 --> 05:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
05:56:02.708 --> 05:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
Beyond Reasonable Doubt must
 
05:56:06.288 --> 05:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
get the ruling that the state of mind
 
05:56:08.570 --> 05:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
has been established
 
05:56:11.230 --> 05:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
State of Mind here in New Hampshire is
 
05:56:13.730 --> 05:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
with purpose
 
05:56:15.548 --> 05:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
with knowledge
 
05:56:19.730 --> 05:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
recklessly or negligently
 
05:56:22.368 --> 05:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
and State of Mind applies to Red Flag
 
05:56:24.670 --> 05:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
laws to show that they're
 
05:56:27.350 --> 05:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional red flag laws
 
05:56:31.190 --> 05:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
everywhere because they don't take those
 
05:56:34.670 --> 05:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
foundations into
 
05:56:34.680 --> 05:56:35.990 align:start position:0%
foundations into
effect

05:56:35.990 --> 05:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
effect
 
05:56:37.368 --> 05:56:37.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:56:41.690 --> 05:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:53.890 --> 05:56:53.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.930 --> 05:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:56:56.940 --> 05:56:57.770 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:56:57.770 --> 05:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:00.708 --> 05:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
I'll just State you know this bill of
 
05:57:03.530 --> 05:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
all the bills today this one uh is
 
05:57:05.330 --> 05:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
really kind of horrific to me it scares
 
05:57:05.340 --> 05:57:06.410 align:start position:0%
really kind of horrific to me it scares
me

05:57:06.410 --> 05:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:57:09.530 --> 05:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
um and it's I understand the intent but
 
05:57:13.250 --> 05:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
it's just the methodology uh it it's um
 
05:57:16.788 --> 05:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
it's basically saying that you're guilty
 
05:57:19.850 --> 05:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
until you're proven innocent and the ex
 
05:57:23.270 --> 05:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
parte not having representation you know
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
as you know again uh as constitutional
 
05:57:29.628 --> 05:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
right just having the ability to face
 
05:57:32.868 --> 05:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
your accuser uh you don't get that
 
05:57:34.788 --> 05:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
um I understand these situations that
 
05:57:36.410 --> 05:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
they use them as a difficult situation
 
05:57:38.390 --> 05:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
but I just don't think it's a path we
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
want to go down to I feel like we're
 
05:57:42.890 --> 05:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
treading two uh it's it's a I feel like
 
05:57:45.470 --> 05:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's a fine
 
05:57:46.910 --> 05:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
um sheet of ice we're kind of trying to
 
05:57:49.368 --> 05:57:49.378 align:start position:0%
walk across here and
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
um I I think the cold water underneath
 
05:57:54.470 --> 05:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
is something we don't want to go into
 
05:57:57.230 --> 05:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
um it just I think there's too much
 
05:57:59.270 --> 05:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
potential for abuse I think this could
 
05:58:01.430 --> 05:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
be politicized
 
05:58:03.948 --> 05:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
um and I really
 
05:58:06.288 --> 05:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
um don't it just doesn't feel who we are
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
as a Americans
 
05:58:10.970 --> 05:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't I I understand the
 
05:58:12.048 --> 05:58:12.058 align:start position:0%
intention but I think there's got to be
 
05:58:14.270 --> 05:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
a different way than this it just does
 
05:58:16.910 --> 05:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
not feel right to me
 
05:58:19.910 --> 05:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
um you know I situation with this that
 
05:58:21.650 --> 05:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
comes to mind
 
05:58:23.810 --> 05:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
and I I'm trying to be respectful of my
 
05:58:25.850 --> 05:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
language here but you know if there's a
 
05:58:29.448 --> 05:58:29.458 align:start position:0%
300 pound man per dating a 95 pound
 
05:58:29.458 --> 05:58:31.070 align:start position:0%
300 pound man per dating a 95 pound
woman

05:58:31.070 --> 05:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
woman
 
05:58:31.080 --> 05:58:32.510 align:start position:0%
woman
and

05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:58:32.520 --> 05:58:34.010 align:start position:0%
and
they

05:58:34.010 --> 05:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:58:37.788 --> 05:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
somebody calls and and uh and and
 
05:58:40.250 --> 05:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
basically uh you and this man's being
 
05:58:43.610 --> 05:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
abusive and they get a restraining order
 
05:58:45.048 --> 05:58:45.058 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
um it does not not much saying that that
 
05:58:51.650 --> 05:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
300 pound man couldn't red flag this 95
 
05:58:53.150 --> 05:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
pound woman because she knows she's got
 
05:58:54.070 --> 05:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
a gun
 
05:58:57.470 --> 05:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
and that night after the police come and
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
take her gun she comes in
 
05:59:02.090 --> 05:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
he's waiting there for
 
05:59:03.948 --> 05:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
and you know we probably know what the
 
05:59:06.048 --> 05:59:06.058 align:start position:0%
outcome would be there I'm overwhelmed
 
05:59:07.310 --> 05:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
that uh you know three to one body
 
05:59:09.530 --> 05:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
weight ratio and physically stronger

I'm here today to speak in favor of

House Bill 106 relative to explain
 
06:00:18.770 --> 06:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
extreme risk protection orders
 
06:00:20.570 --> 06:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
the United States Surgeon General has
 
06:00:22.250 --> 06:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
identified that suicide is a major
 
06:00:24.230 --> 06:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
public health issue in the United States
 
06:00:27.470 --> 06:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
and one that is largely preventable
 
06:00:30.110 --> 06:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
however we have done little as a state
 
06:00:32.868 --> 06:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
or a society to prevent suicide
 
06:00:35.270 --> 06:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
the impact of even a single death is
 
06:00:37.010 --> 06:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
profound and ripples into our family

Responders and Beyond
 
06:00:46.610 --> 06:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that 90 of all
 
06:00:49.548 --> 06:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
people who survive a suicide attempt do
 
06:00:52.610 --> 06:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
not go on to die by Suicide
 
06:00:55.070 --> 06:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
unlike almost every other means of
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
suicide use of a fire firearm in the
 
06:01:00.530 --> 06:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
suicide attempt is almost always lethal
 
06:01:02.750 --> 06:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
and leaves little opportunity for
 
06:01:02.760 --> 06:01:04.910 align:start position:0%
and leaves little opportunity for
intervention

06:01:04.910 --> 06:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
06:01:07.490 --> 06:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
while people may contemplate suicide for
 
06:01:09.770 --> 06:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
a long period of time once they make the
 
06:01:12.230 --> 06:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
decision to end their life the window of
 
06:01:13.970 --> 06:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
time before they make an attempt is
 
06:01:15.948 --> 06:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
often very small
 
06:01:19.070 --> 06:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
toward that end temporarily restricting
 
06:01:21.830 --> 06:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
access to lethal means in this case
 
06:01:21.840 --> 06:01:24.230 align:start position:0%
access to lethal means in this case

firearms
 
06:01:26.208 --> 06:01:26.218 align:start position:0%
is one tool

I'll wrap up in one second sir I
 
06:01:51.830 --> 06:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
apologize let me just wrap up by saying
 
06:01:53.990 --> 06:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
that you know simply put you've got the

chart you can look at it
 
06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
um temporarily restricting Firearms when
 
06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
individuals pose a significant risk to
 
06:02:02.270 --> 06:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
themselves for others is one tool that
 
06:02:04.190 --> 06:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
we can use to reduce suicide New

House Bill 106 the erpo red flag laws
 
06:05:32.510 --> 06:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
plain and simple red flag laws violate
 
06:05:35.208 --> 06:05:35.218 align:start position:0%
due process on its face
 
06:05:37.070 --> 06:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
we all learned in first or second grade
 
06:05:39.948 --> 06:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
in Civics that were Presumed Innocent in
 
06:05:42.230 --> 06:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
this great United States until presumed
 
06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
until proven guilty beyond a shadow of a
 
06:05:46.730 --> 06:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
doubt with a jury the judge and a whole
 
06:05:46.740 --> 06:05:47.810 align:start position:0%
doubt with a jury the judge and a whole
courtroom

06:05:47.810 --> 06:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
courtroom
 
06:05:50.930 --> 06:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
when flag laws take what any person
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
could exhibit red flags if someone
 
06:05:56.390 --> 06:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
mentions uh joke or they're angry or
 
06:05:59.270 --> 06:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
they seem upset or anything and it
 
06:06:01.250 --> 06:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
punishes them by taking away a natural
 
06:06:03.350 --> 06:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
right as protected by the Second
 
06:06:06.170 --> 06:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
Amendment and article two a I believe of
 
06:06:07.850 --> 06:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution it
 
06:06:10.730 --> 06:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
punishes them with hearsay evidence ex
 
06:06:14.110 --> 06:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
parte hearing without their
 
06:06:16.250 --> 06:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
constitutional natural right to face
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
their accuser without them being present
 
06:06:19.670 --> 06:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
without them knowing
 
06:06:22.430 --> 06:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
and it punishes them forces them after
 
06:06:24.288 --> 06:06:24.298 align:start position:0%
the fact to pay for a lawyer which you
 
06:06:26.030 --> 06:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
may know costs hundreds of thousands or
 
06:06:27.530 --> 06:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars which I don't have
 
06:06:29.448 --> 06:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
that kind of money on me and then they
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
can go to court and try to reverse a
 
06:06:32.570 --> 06:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
judgment and if you've gone to court to
 
06:06:34.310 --> 06:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
try to reverse a judgment you know it's
 
06:06:36.410 --> 06:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
pretty difficult it would cost hundreds
 
06:06:37.910 --> 06:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars in lawyers fees
 
06:06:40.128 --> 06:06:40.138 align:start position:0%
so it's flipped you're presumed guilty
 
06:06:42.048 --> 06:06:42.058 align:start position:0%
and punished until you prove your
 
06:06:44.510 --> 06:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
innocence in the country I thought I
 
06:06:46.430 --> 06:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
grew up in you're presumed innocent
 
06:06:49.490 --> 06:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
until someone proves you're guilty
 
06:06:51.650 --> 06:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
it also violates the Second Amendment
 
06:06:54.048 --> 06:06:54.058 align:start position:0%
which says shall not be infringed and
 
06:06:55.250 --> 06:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
you'll notice some amendments actually
 
06:06:57.170 --> 06:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
have some exceptions like the fourth and
 
06:06:59.708 --> 06:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
fifth amendments but upon probable cause
 
06:07:02.570 --> 06:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
but upon you know a search specific
 
06:07:04.490 --> 06:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
search the second amendment has no such
 
06:07:06.410 --> 06:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
exceptions it says shall not be
 
06:07:08.390 --> 06:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
infringed the founders could have put
 
06:07:10.548 --> 06:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
exceptions in there but they didn't for
 
06:07:11.990 --> 06:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
anything that could be considered a red
 
06:07:12.000 --> 06:07:13.788 align:start position:0%
anything that could be considered a red
flag

06:07:13.788 --> 06:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
flag
 
06:07:16.548 --> 06:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
um so for anything that could be they
 
06:07:18.230 --> 06:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
didn't put exceptions for potentially
 
06:07:20.448 --> 06:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
but flag Behavior or speech speaking of
 
06:07:22.368 --> 06:07:22.378 align:start position:0%
speech where flag laws may actually
 
06:07:24.288 --> 06:07:24.298 align:start position:0%
violate the First Amendment too that
 
06:07:25.368 --> 06:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
there have been some cases that went
 
06:07:26.810 --> 06:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
into federal courts I think the Supreme
 
06:07:29.030 --> 06:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
Court of of uh speech that someone made
 
06:07:31.548 --> 06:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
that was posting song lyrics that were
 
06:07:33.708 --> 06:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh pretty intense and passionate and
 
06:07:35.330 --> 06:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
they were he was red flagged for song
 
06:07:35.340 --> 06:07:36.230 align:start position:0%
they were he was red flagged for song
lyrics

06:07:36.230 --> 06:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
lyrics
 
06:07:37.730 --> 06:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it was even Eminem but
 
06:07:38.930 --> 06:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
I think it was a little less intense
 
06:07:40.850 --> 06:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
than that but if you post any any song
 
06:07:42.350 --> 06:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
like that they could be a red flag
 
06:07:44.208 --> 06:07:44.218 align:start position:0%
because he says some some pretty
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
um intense ridiculous stuff that should
 
06:07:48.708 --> 06:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
count yeah thank you very much I'll try
 
06:07:50.390 --> 06:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
to submit testimony to them please do I
 
06:07:52.570 --> 06:07:52.580 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
06:08:02.810 --> 06:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:06.410 --> 06:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's you're so evil no I'm gonna cut
 
06:08:07.788 --> 06:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
stuff out and try to be quick about this
 
06:08:09.770 --> 06:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh this is the same route here until
 
06:08:13.128 --> 06:08:13.138 align:start position:0%
midnight what hey hey watch it this is
 
06:08:14.628 --> 06:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
the same degree just in Draconian
 
06:08:15.948 --> 06:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
legislation that New York City
 
06:08:17.750 --> 06:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
billionaire Michael Bloomberg spent
 
06:08:19.368 --> 06:08:19.378 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars pushing a few years
 
06:08:21.410 --> 06:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
ago so we'll remind you why this
 
06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is so bad aside from the
 
06:08:25.430 --> 06:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
fact that it's completely discriminatory
 
06:08:28.250 --> 06:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
against a subset of granite Staters
 
06:08:29.390 --> 06:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
um pretty much anyone and their brother
 
06:08:31.010 --> 06:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
can make an accusation against an
 
06:08:32.810 --> 06:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
unknowing law abiding gun owner your
 
06:08:34.430 --> 06:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
ex-mother-in-law who hates that you left
 
06:08:36.770 --> 06:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
her abusive son a former Psychopathic
 
06:08:38.270 --> 06:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
roommate who was still angry and moved
 
06:08:40.430 --> 06:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
out even if it was two years ago a step
 
06:08:41.930 --> 06:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
cousin of your stepson of your husband
 
06:08:44.150 --> 06:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
from a second marriage you get the drift
 
06:08:46.490 --> 06:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
and of course the police can file a
 
06:08:49.070 --> 06:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
petition on anyone at any time ironic
 
06:08:50.448 --> 06:08:50.458 align:start position:0%
coming from the same people who support
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
that defund the police movement the bar
 
06:08:55.310 --> 06:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
is set so low for evidence that pretty
 
06:08:57.410 --> 06:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
much anything goes all the petitioner
 
06:08:59.390 --> 06:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
has to do is convince a judge that they
 
06:09:01.670 --> 06:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
believe the accused is thinking about
 
06:09:03.410 --> 06:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
thinking about harming themselves or
 
06:09:05.448 --> 06:09:05.458 align:start position:0%
others sometime in the future in other
 
06:09:07.070 --> 06:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
words the petitioner has a crystal ball
 
06:09:08.570 --> 06:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
and can see into the future in the
 
06:09:10.250 --> 06:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
courts and law enforcement will act as
 
06:09:12.590 --> 06:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
thought police the accused could have
 
06:09:14.090 --> 06:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
written or said something out of anger a
 
06:09:15.770 --> 06:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago that's considered
 
06:09:18.230 --> 06:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
evidence the rules for evidence are not
 
06:09:20.330 --> 06:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
the same as in a criminal case who are
 
06:09:22.850 --> 06:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
the accused law abiding gun owners who
 
06:09:25.190 --> 06:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
have committed no crime I'm going to
 
06:09:27.410 --> 06:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
repeat that the accused are law-abiding
 
06:09:29.330 --> 06:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
gun owners who have committed no crime
 
06:09:31.070 --> 06:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
once a petition has been granted
 
06:09:33.350 --> 06:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
surprise the thought police are your
 
06:09:35.270 --> 06:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
door confiscating your firearms and you
 
06:09:37.190 --> 06:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
have no idea why
 
06:09:39.230 --> 06:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
someone already talked about the the
 
06:09:41.690 --> 06:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
thousands that the accused would have to
 
06:09:44.208 --> 06:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
spend to get their rights back uh
 
06:09:46.310 --> 06:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
proponents of the red flag Bill have
 
06:09:48.410 --> 06:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
talked about suicide and all the states
 
06:09:50.570 --> 06:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
that have red flag laws in place neither
 
06:09:52.788 --> 06:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
suicides or homicides were decreased red
 
06:09:55.128 --> 06:09:55.138 align:start position:0%
flag laws did absolutely nothing there's
 
06:09:57.170 --> 06:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
another law we do have on the books in
 
06:09:58.430 --> 06:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire called involuntary
 
06:10:00.770 --> 06:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
admissions this is specific to mental
 
06:10:02.510 --> 06:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
health applies to every single Granite
 
06:10:05.570 --> 06:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
stator there's due process and it's
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
adjudicated by a court and that actually
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
provides and mandates mental health care
 
06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
whether outpatient or inpatient and as
 
06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
we already know spoke about it earlier
 
06:10:16.970 --> 06:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
you're adjudicated mentally how to get
 
06:10:18.890 --> 06:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
mental health help you're a prohibited
 
06:10:18.900 --> 06:10:19.850 align:start position:0%
mental health help you're a prohibited
person

06:10:19.850 --> 06:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
person
 
06:10:23.208 --> 06:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
HP 106 isn't about protection it's about
 
06:10:25.548 --> 06:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
gun confiscation Bill of Rights be
 
06:10:28.128 --> 06:10:28.138 align:start position:0%
damned and you know it's really really
 
06:10:31.190 --> 06:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
kind of ironic a New York state supreme
 
06:10:33.948 --> 06:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
court judge just ruled Michael

attorneys fees and costs paid from tax

second
 
06:12:21.830 --> 06:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
any red flag law has to have in it a
 
06:12:25.250 --> 06:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
right of private action to bring the
 
06:12:28.448 --> 06:12:28.458 align:start position:0%
prosecution for perjury against someone
 
06:12:32.930 --> 06:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
who mislead support into granting a red
 
06:12:34.070 --> 06:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
flag order
 
06:12:36.230 --> 06:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
perjury is a
 
06:12:39.350 --> 06:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
basically never prosecuted
 
06:12:43.030 --> 06:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
but since a red flag order can cause
 
06:12:45.948 --> 06:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
tremendous financial and reputational
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
damage to a person there has to be short
 
06:12:49.440 --> 06:12:50.990 align:start position:0%

recourse
 
06:12:53.150 --> 06:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
so that
 
06:12:55.850 --> 06:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
the right of private action means the
 
06:12:58.610 --> 06:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
person who's wrongly targeted falsely
 
06:13:02.270 --> 06:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
accused hires an attorney who then is
 
06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
authorized by law to bring and prosecute
 
06:13:07.368 --> 06:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
a perjury charge
 
06:13:10.190 --> 06:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
and again that attorney has to be paid
 
06:13:13.190 --> 06:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
their normal hourly rate attorneys are
 
06:13:15.110 --> 06:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
not charities
 
06:13:17.750 --> 06:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll be happy to
 
06:13:19.670 --> 06:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
answer questions and I think I'm within
 
06:13:22.250 --> 06:13:22.260 align:start position:0%

hello and thank you I believe 106 is
 
06:13:39.470 --> 06:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
essentially good intentions gone wrong a
 
06:13:41.690 --> 06:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
family the definition could be an
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
ex-spouse who no longer lives at the
 
06:13:46.670 --> 06:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
same address which means women suffering
 
06:13:49.128 --> 06:13:49.138 align:start position:0%
for an abusive ex could be stripped of
 
06:13:51.890 --> 06:13:51.900 align:start position:0%

06:13:55.128 --> 06:13:55.138 align:start position:0%

06:13:57.230 --> 06:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
mental health issues don't care about
 
06:14:00.170 --> 06:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
laws or penalties this bill will arm
 
06:14:03.110 --> 06:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
abusers with another way to weaken their
 
06:14:06.470 --> 06:14:06.480 align:start position:0%

06:14:08.628 --> 06:14:08.638 align:start position:0%

Hometown it could be from any city or
 
06:14:15.110 --> 06:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
town I'd like to remind you in 2021 the
 
06:14:17.990 --> 06:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
FBI highlighted highlighted moms
 
06:14:20.510 --> 06:14:20.520 align:start position:0%

06:14:23.150 --> 06:14:23.160 align:start position:0%

people lie they lie all the time I know
 
06:14:33.410 --> 06:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
I was in a relationship with a
 
06:14:35.270 --> 06:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
pathological liar
 
06:14:37.970 --> 06:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
and we've seen that on the testimony on
 
06:14:40.788 --> 06:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
the gun background checks criminals
 
06:14:43.670 --> 06:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't tell the truth
 
06:14:46.788 --> 06:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
but the big problems of this bill
 
06:14:49.850 --> 06:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
is that it's based on predictions not on
 
06:14:53.030 --> 06:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
actions the other main problems of the
 
06:14:55.368 --> 06:14:55.378 align:start position:0%
court is not bound by any technical

Rules of Evidence
 
06:15:00.288 --> 06:15:00.298 align:start position:0%

06:15:03.770 --> 06:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
notice to the respondent or defendant
 
06:15:08.930 --> 06:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
C-section 159 F4 what's worse is the
 
06:15:10.850 --> 06:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
temporary extreme risk protection order
 
06:15:13.490 --> 06:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
is an ex parte hearing which means the
 
06:15:16.250 --> 06:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
defendant is not even included and
 
06:15:18.970 --> 06:15:18.980 align:start position:0%
cannot defend themselves this is

order bill because it provides families
 
06:15:53.090 --> 06:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
a proven tool to reduce gun suicides and
 
06:15:55.730 --> 06:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
mass shootings I will focus my comments
 
06:15:58.610 --> 06:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
on gun suicide because a shocking 89
 
06:16:00.590 --> 06:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
percent of gun deaths in New Hampshire
 
06:16:02.330 --> 06:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
are suicides
 
06:16:04.610 --> 06:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
gun suicide in New Hampshire has
 
06:16:08.150 --> 06:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
increased 61 percent between 2011 and
 
06:16:11.208 --> 06:16:11.218 align:start position:0%

Nationwide
 
06:16:15.470 --> 06:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
many gun violence tragedies are preceded
 
06:16:18.410 --> 06:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
by red flags warning signs that are
 
06:16:21.410 --> 06:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
often noticed by family members reducing
 
06:16:24.110 --> 06:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
a suicidal person's access to Firearms
 
06:16:27.948 --> 06:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
by temporarily removing them from when
 
06:16:30.650 --> 06:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
them when that person is clearly in
 
06:16:32.990 --> 06:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
crisis could save their life
 
06:16:35.510 --> 06:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
data shows that having access to a
 
06:16:37.970 --> 06:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
firearm triples one's risk of death by
 
06:16:40.548 --> 06:16:40.558 align:start position:0%
Suicide and states that have passed this
 
06:16:43.310 --> 06:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
type of protective order or red flag law
 
06:16:46.610 --> 06:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
have seen decreases in fire firearm
 
06:16:48.110 --> 06:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
suicide rates
 
06:16:50.270 --> 06:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
my personal experience working with
 
06:16:52.208 --> 06:16:52.218 align:start position:0%
families in New Hampshire
 
06:16:55.730 --> 06:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
in crisis reinforce my belief that
 
06:16:58.670 --> 06:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
families deserve access to every tool
 
06:17:01.490 --> 06:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
that can help prevent warning signs from
 
06:17:03.708 --> 06:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
escalating into tragedy
 
06:17:06.470 --> 06:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to temporarily limit access
 
06:17:09.770 --> 06:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
to lethal Firearms by individuals in
 
06:17:12.410 --> 06:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
crisis can help save lives
 
06:17:14.510 --> 06:17:14.520 align:start position:0%

it it sounded like you said Hall I said
 
06:17:36.830 --> 06:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're in the hall I probably did
 
06:17:39.350 --> 06:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
pronounce it wrong I'm sorry that's okay
 
06:17:41.448 --> 06:17:41.458 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Representatives thank you
 
06:17:43.070 --> 06:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
for sitting there I know this is a long
 
06:17:43.080 --> 06:17:44.208 align:start position:0%
for sitting there I know this is a long
day

06:17:44.208 --> 06:17:44.218 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:17:45.948 --> 06:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
um I have four documents I want to turn
 
06:17:47.810 --> 06:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
into you one is a letter from the New
 
06:17:49.788 --> 06:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Firearms Coalition regarding
 
06:17:51.410 --> 06:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
all the bills I would ask the clerk that
 
06:17:53.448 --> 06:17:53.458 align:start position:0%
a copy be placed in each bill folder
 
06:17:55.250 --> 06:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
that's listed on that letter instead of
 
06:17:57.410 --> 06:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
me speaking multiple times I covered it
 
06:17:58.730 --> 06:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
all in one letter
 
06:18:00.110 --> 06:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
there is a letter from former
 
06:18:02.030 --> 06:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Itza relative to this
 
06:18:04.490 --> 06:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
bill in particular I would have asked
 
06:18:05.628 --> 06:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
that you would add that to the file
 
06:18:08.270 --> 06:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
second is a supreme court a third is a
 
06:18:09.708 --> 06:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision that's worth
 
06:18:12.410 --> 06:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
reviewing and fourth is the famous that
 
06:18:13.548 --> 06:18:13.558 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about New York
 
06:18:15.650 --> 06:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's Court decision that came
 
06:18:18.770 --> 06:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
out late December that has to do with
 
06:18:19.970 --> 06:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
the bill at hand
 
06:18:21.770 --> 06:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
I would like to read a couple of pieces
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
from that particular Supreme Court
 
06:18:25.690 --> 06:18:25.700 align:start position:0%
decision so everybody's on the same page
 
06:18:29.208 --> 06:18:29.218 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to ask for an extra minute
 
06:18:30.770 --> 06:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
if I can from the committee only because
 
06:18:35.448 --> 06:18:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:37.730 --> 06:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
on August 30th the petitioner filed with
 
06:18:39.230 --> 06:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
the court I'm cutting out a few words
 
06:18:41.448 --> 06:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
names and things an application for a
 
06:18:43.010 --> 06:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
temporary extreme risk protection order
 
06:18:45.650 --> 06:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
in his application the petitioner
 
06:18:47.030 --> 06:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
alleged that his estranged girlfriend
 
06:18:49.430 --> 06:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
was a threat to herself the petitioner
 
06:18:51.530 --> 06:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
or another person that was the grounds
 
06:18:53.628 --> 06:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
for this entire case
 
06:18:56.270 --> 06:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay this is the exact same case former
 
06:18:58.250 --> 06:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
speakers have talked about that says oh
 
06:18:59.990 --> 06:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is about suicide
 
06:19:03.410 --> 06:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
at the conclusion of this court case one
 
06:19:05.390 --> 06:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
or two pages from the end
 
06:19:07.010 --> 06:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
the judge right or the Supreme Court
 
06:19:08.990 --> 06:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
writes however when viewed objectively
 
06:19:12.250 --> 06:19:12.260 align:start position:0%
the law which is their law CPL are
 
06:19:14.570 --> 06:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
63-a's goal of removing weapons from
 
06:19:16.610 --> 06:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
otherwise lawful possession of of their
 
06:19:18.890 --> 06:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
owners with adequate sorry without
 
06:19:20.930 --> 06:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
adequate constitutional safeguards
 
06:19:23.150 --> 06:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
cannot be condoned by this court
 
06:19:25.548 --> 06:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
therefore temporary extreme risk
 
06:19:27.230 --> 06:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
protection orders extreme risk
 
06:19:28.368 --> 06:19:28.378 align:start position:0%
protection orders are deemed
 
06:19:30.948 --> 06:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by this court
 
06:19:33.170 --> 06:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
going on further it cannot be stated
 
06:19:34.788 --> 06:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
clearly enough that the Second Amendment
 
06:19:36.470 --> 06:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
is not a second class right nor should
 
06:19:38.270 --> 06:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
it ever be treated as such
 
06:19:40.010 --> 06:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
that is the recent Supreme Court
 
06:19:42.230 --> 06:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
decision on the heels of sorry New York
 
06:19:43.788 --> 06:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision on the heels of
 
06:19:46.128 --> 06:19:46.138 align:start position:0%
some of the Supreme Court decisions
 
06:19:47.750 --> 06:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
all of these bills that we've heard
 
06:19:50.270 --> 06:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
today violate constitutional protections
 
06:19:54.590 --> 06:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
all of these bills today okay would if
 
06:19:56.390 --> 06:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
they came out of committee would run
 
06:19:58.250 --> 06:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
afoul of
 
06:20:00.770 --> 06:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
um house rule 45a which commends or
 
06:20:02.690 --> 06:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
commands us not to pass with a positive
 
06:20:04.368 --> 06:20:04.378 align:start position:0%
recommendation any bill that violates
 
06:20:07.310 --> 06:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:09.770 --> 06:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
two years ago this bill was was sent to
 
06:20:11.330 --> 06:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
this committee I know hurry up two
 
06:20:13.190 --> 06:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
million okay and it was a financial
 
06:20:15.530 --> 06:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
protection order at that time that's how
 
06:20:17.390 --> 06:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
they were trying to get it through at
 
06:20:18.470 --> 06:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
least they've been on this this year
 
06:20:20.208 --> 06:20:20.218 align:start position:0%
they aren't intending to take our
 
06:20:23.330 --> 06:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
Firearms representative we we did
 
06:20:24.890 --> 06:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
actually Grant you an extra 30 seconds
 
06:20:27.770 --> 06:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
okay in there and we are going to have
 
06:20:30.470 --> 06:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
to okay this is a civil process not a
 
06:20:32.150 --> 06:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
criminal process if it was a criminal
 
06:20:33.770 --> 06:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
process all the new protections that the
 
06:20:35.090 --> 06:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
courts are looking for would be in place
 
06:20:37.548 --> 06:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
but this process by its design is
 
06:20:39.288 --> 06:20:39.298 align:start position:0%
intended to circumvent those civil
 
06:20:42.890 --> 06:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
protections thank you thank you
 
06:20:42.900 --> 06:20:46.850 align:start position:0%

what there's no due process at all

you're taking personal property from

that somebody may be a danger to

06:21:45.830 --> 06:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
because on the back of my business cards
 
06:21:49.190 --> 06:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
I put the suicide hotline
 
06:21:51.230 --> 06:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
nowhere in this bill
 
06:21:54.490 --> 06:21:54.500 align:start position:0%
and no one else and this hearing today
 
06:21:57.048 --> 06:21:57.058 align:start position:0%
has mentioned about the person who's in

petition to take personal property away

the firearms
 
06:22:40.250 --> 06:22:40.260 align:start position:0%

a hearing
 
06:22:44.030 --> 06:22:44.040 align:start position:0%

06:22:45.948 --> 06:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
leave them with their car keys alcohol
 
06:22:47.810 --> 06:22:47.820 align:start position:0%

I am uh Tom mannion I'm uh represent
 
06:23:26.390 --> 06:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro One Pelham I'm here to speak
 
06:23:29.448 --> 06:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
against HP 106. everybody covered uh the
 
06:23:31.310 --> 06:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
due process component of this really
 
06:23:33.470 --> 06:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
well and so I'm gonna cut through a good
 
06:23:35.448 --> 06:23:35.458 align:start position:0%
chunk of my testimony here
 
06:23:36.948 --> 06:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
um there's something that nobody covered
 
06:23:40.010 --> 06:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh as an Iraq war veteran I fortunately
 
06:23:41.990 --> 06:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
emerged mentally sound from my time over
 
06:23:44.510 --> 06:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
there not all of us did while the VA
 
06:23:46.610 --> 06:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
offers free Mental Health Care there's a
 
06:23:48.650 --> 06:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
free fear amongst veterans that if they
 
06:23:51.288 --> 06:23:51.298 align:start position:0%
seek help their guns will be taken away
 
06:23:53.868 --> 06:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
this is a very rare real fear amongst
 
06:23:55.070 --> 06:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
that community
 
06:23:57.230 --> 06:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
the mere existence of red flag laws with
 
06:23:58.610 --> 06:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
language about potential harm to
 
06:24:00.110 --> 06:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
yourself it's understandable why the
 
06:24:02.090 --> 06:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
Vets feel this way so instead of getting
 
06:24:04.190 --> 06:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
the help that they need they'd rather
 
06:24:05.390 --> 06:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
tough it out
 
06:24:07.010 --> 06:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
they'd rather grapple with their demons
 
06:24:09.350 --> 06:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
alone and have than have their firearms
 
06:24:11.990 --> 06:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
confiscated and I completely understand
 
06:24:13.788 --> 06:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
however the deadly scenario the red flag
 
06:24:15.590 --> 06:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
law is attempting to prevent can become
 
06:24:17.690 --> 06:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
a reality instead I asked the committee
 
06:24:20.208 --> 06:24:20.218 align:start position:0%
to itl HP 106 and I'm willing to take
 
06:24:23.628 --> 06:24:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:28.750 --> 06:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:48.890 --> 06:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:50.930 --> 06:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
my name is Marie Cassidy and I live in

in favor of HP 106.
 
06:25:02.690 --> 06:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
the importance of this public safety
 
06:25:04.670 --> 06:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
issue is personal to me
 
06:25:06.890 --> 06:25:06.900 align:start position:0%

06:25:08.030 --> 06:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
06:25:10.910 --> 06:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
both young men Edward Rogers and Fred
 
06:25:14.810 --> 06:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
shields were veterans dealing with PTSD
 
06:25:16.670 --> 06:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
at the bill such as this one that would
 
06:25:18.530 --> 06:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
allow family members to request the
 
06:25:21.530 --> 06:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
removal of firearms had been in place my
 
06:25:25.788 --> 06:25:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:27.770 --> 06:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
gun suicide death rates in New Hampshire
 
06:25:29.990 --> 06:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
are more than 25 percent higher than the
 
06:25:31.190 --> 06:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
national rate
 
06:25:33.708 --> 06:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
the granite state rates 26 in the
 
06:25:36.230 --> 06:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
country for gun suicide deaths
 
06:25:38.330 --> 06:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
suicide is the second leading cause of
 
06:25:40.970 --> 06:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
death for ages 10 to 14 44 in New
 
06:25:40.980 --> 06:25:41.990 align:start position:0%
death for ages 10 to 14 44 in New
Hampshire

06:25:41.990 --> 06:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:25:44.570 --> 06:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
on average one person dies by suicide
 
06:25:47.330 --> 06:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
every 68 hours in our state
 
06:25:49.610 --> 06:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
nine out of ten Firearms suicide
 
06:25:51.948 --> 06:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
attempts end in death
 
06:25:54.288 --> 06:25:54.298 align:start position:0%
suicides account for the majority of gun
 
06:25:57.410 --> 06:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
deaths in our state 89 percent
 
06:25:59.390 --> 06:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
data from states that have enacted
 
06:26:02.090 --> 06:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
herbal laws suggest one life is saved
 
06:26:04.910 --> 06:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
for every 10 to 11 gun removals carried
 
06:26:06.610 --> 06:26:06.620 align:start position:0%
out under the law
 
06:26:09.350 --> 06:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
suicide is an impulsive Act
 
06:26:12.048 --> 06:26:12.058 align:start position:0%
guns are a fast deadly way to act on
 
06:26:13.548 --> 06:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
those impulses
 
06:26:15.890 --> 06:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
people considering suicide often give
 
06:26:18.230 --> 06:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
some signs of their intentions
 
06:26:20.990 --> 06:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
passage of hb-106 would allow the family
 
06:26:23.090 --> 06:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
members and loved ones who see these
 
06:26:24.890 --> 06:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
intentions to act
 
06:26:26.868 --> 06:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
to have weapons removed and to help
 
06:26:29.208 --> 06:26:29.218 align:start position:0%
ensure that those they love and those
 
06:26:32.030 --> 06:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
around them are kept safe and whole
 
06:26:34.730 --> 06:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:26:37.670 --> 06:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Cassidy I speak for all
 
06:26:40.190 --> 06:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
of our the criminal justice members and
 
06:26:45.948 --> 06:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:09.970 --> 06:27:09.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:14.270 --> 06:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
I ask to itl this bill please
 
06:27:17.690 --> 06:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
this is merely a red flag gun seizure
 
06:27:17.700 --> 06:27:18.708 align:start position:0%
this is merely a red flag gun seizure
bill

06:27:18.708 --> 06:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:27:21.530 --> 06:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
it is discriminatory to Firearms only
 
06:27:23.690 --> 06:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
and not to other possible dangerous
 
06:27:26.030 --> 06:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
weapons such as Motor Vehicles hammers
 
06:27:29.448 --> 06:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
knives baseball bats poisons alcohol
 
06:27:32.990 --> 06:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
bottles and any other weapon like if you
 
06:27:35.750 --> 06:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
look on WMUR today the woman you use her
 
06:27:37.670 --> 06:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
exercise wrote to kill her three
 
06:27:37.680 --> 06:27:38.690 align:start position:0%
exercise wrote to kill her three
children

06:27:38.690 --> 06:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:27:41.350 --> 06:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
but we don't see that in the bill
 
06:27:45.288 --> 06:27:45.298 align:start position:0%
this bill is also right for abuse by a
 
06:27:47.510 --> 06:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
spurned spouse significant other or a
 
06:27:49.430 --> 06:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
police officer you may have had an issue
 
06:27:49.440 --> 06:27:50.090 align:start position:0%
police officer you may have had an issue
with

06:27:50.090 --> 06:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
it is not difficult to get on the wrong
 
06:27:54.650 --> 06:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
side if you file complaints against them
 
06:27:57.410 --> 06:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
as we know they are not above abusing
 
06:28:00.650 --> 06:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
Authority while it may be a minority it
 
06:28:03.048 --> 06:28:03.058 align:start position:0%
only takes one
 
06:28:05.930 --> 06:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
this is another punitive proposal to a
 
06:28:08.150 --> 06:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
firearm owner as they must pay storage
 
06:28:10.730 --> 06:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
for their Liberty strip from them and
 
06:28:12.650 --> 06:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
the respondent must prove his or her
 
06:28:14.750 --> 06:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
innocent Which flies in the face of
 
06:28:16.788 --> 06:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections
 
06:28:19.490 --> 06:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
it is also less than believable that
 
06:28:22.610 --> 06:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
someone will be prosecuted under 159 f11
 
06:28:26.330 --> 06:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
as we see domestic violence cases
 
06:28:29.628 --> 06:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
based on untruths fail and no charges
 
06:28:32.208 --> 06:28:32.218 align:start position:0%
are ever brought I know this is a fact
 
06:28:34.850 --> 06:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
because I represented a man last year a
 
06:28:36.590 --> 06:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
Conga District Court he was found not
 
06:28:40.490 --> 06:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
guilty of domestic violence and she was
 
06:28:42.590 --> 06:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
proven to have committed perjury and was
 
06:28:44.390 --> 06:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
never charged
 
06:28:47.448 --> 06:28:47.458 align:start position:0%
further charging quality is skewed in
 
06:28:50.330 --> 06:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
this bill from Felony possession to
 
06:28:53.708 --> 06:28:53.718 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor attempt for application
 
06:28:57.470 --> 06:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
lies when it's a federal felony for
 
06:29:01.610 --> 06:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
lying on the same 44 73 application form
 
06:29:07.490 --> 06:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:11.570 --> 06:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:25.010 --> 06:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:28.368 --> 06:29:28.378 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I'm Sue Newman I'm from
 
06:29:31.850 --> 06:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro for nashua's Ward 2 and I
 
06:29:34.750 --> 06:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
support this legislation
 
06:29:37.430 --> 06:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately everything I've put down
 
06:29:40.430 --> 06:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
most of it has all been said and
 
06:29:43.190 --> 06:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
especially I didn't get your name but
 
06:29:45.890 --> 06:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
the not the most recent mom but the one
 
06:29:48.590 --> 06:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
before her she really I was scratching
 
06:29:50.330 --> 06:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
out things along the way she covered
 
06:29:52.910 --> 06:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
just about everything however
 
06:29:56.930 --> 06:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
I will comment that I know no amount of
 
06:29:56.940 --> 06:29:58.730 align:start position:0%
I will comment that I know no amount of
legislation

06:29:58.730 --> 06:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:30:02.448 --> 06:30:02.458 align:start position:0%
can mandate or require good rational
 
06:30:02.458 --> 06:30:04.510 align:start position:0%
can mandate or require good rational
safe

06:30:04.510 --> 06:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
safe
 
06:30:07.430 --> 06:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
Behavior or for someone to make good
 
06:30:09.530 --> 06:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
choices we just can't legislate good
 
06:30:13.208 --> 06:30:13.218 align:start position:0%
behavior but I do believe that extreme
 
06:30:17.628 --> 06:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
this extreme risk Bill does provide a
 
06:30:20.510 --> 06:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
way a mechanism to intervene in
 
06:30:23.930 --> 06:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
situations before warning signs and
 
06:30:26.990 --> 06:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
exhibited disturbing behaviors become
 
06:30:27.000 --> 06:30:28.310 align:start position:0%
exhibited disturbing behaviors become
tragedies

06:30:28.310 --> 06:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
tragedies
 
06:30:30.350 --> 06:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to roll back just a little bit
 
06:30:33.890 --> 06:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
I think 2018 the Parklands Florida
 
06:30:37.128 --> 06:30:37.138 align:start position:0%
school shooting and not too long after
 
06:30:37.138 --> 06:30:38.330 align:start position:0%
school shooting and not too long after
that

06:30:38.330 --> 06:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:30:41.510 --> 06:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
awful tragic occurrence happened Florida
 
06:30:45.470 --> 06:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
did pass red flag laws and they did it
 
06:30:47.930 --> 06:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
primarily because the shooter at that
 
06:30:51.948 --> 06:30:51.958 align:start position:0%
school had been he was he was made
 
06:30:55.128 --> 06:30:55.138 align:start position:0%
noticed to police and other officials
 
06:30:57.890 --> 06:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
several times before that and I think
 
06:30:59.570 --> 06:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
they felt we could have we could have
 
06:31:01.128 --> 06:31:01.138 align:start position:0%
done something
 
06:31:02.868 --> 06:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
true story
 
06:31:06.470 --> 06:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
several years ago I was having a casual
 
06:31:08.448 --> 06:31:08.458 align:start position:0%
conversation with the United States
 
06:31:11.868 --> 06:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
senators staff person we were talking
 
06:31:14.448 --> 06:31:14.458 align:start position:0%
about background checks who could
 
06:31:17.170 --> 06:31:17.180 align:start position:0%
qualify to get a firearm who wasn't
 
06:31:19.970 --> 06:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
allowed to get a firearm and so forth
 
06:31:23.030 --> 06:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden it came okay but
 
06:31:25.368 --> 06:31:25.378 align:start position:0%
what do you do about the person maybe
 
06:31:28.250 --> 06:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
your brother they've lost their job the
 
06:31:31.010 --> 06:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
wife took off the mortgage is late and
 
06:31:34.070 --> 06:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
the dog just got run over by a car and
 
06:31:36.830 --> 06:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
there's a firearm in the house what do
 
06:31:38.030 --> 06:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
you do
 
06:31:40.430 --> 06:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
06:31:42.530 --> 06:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
there was silence she had nothing more
 
06:31:45.170 --> 06:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
to say I had nothing more to say so if
 
06:31:46.970 --> 06:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
there can be something
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the form of an intervention that is
 
06:31:52.610 --> 06:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
out there it's a tool I hope it could be
 
06:31:56.030 --> 06:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
used as for comments made by several
 
06:31:58.310 --> 06:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
people as to what's constitutional or
 
06:32:01.070 --> 06:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
not I'm aware of the court case that was
 
06:32:04.128 --> 06:32:04.138 align:start position:0%
cited but I'm also aware that as I came
 
06:32:06.830 --> 06:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
early this morning I hadn't seen any
 
06:32:10.490 --> 06:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
news crawler that 19 states that have
 
06:32:13.128 --> 06:32:13.138 align:start position:0%
red flag laws have repealed all their
 
06:32:16.490 --> 06:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
laws because of Any court case yet so I
 
06:32:18.410 --> 06:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
maybe some fact checking would be
 
06:32:20.930 --> 06:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
helpful so everybody knows what is
 
06:32:23.628 --> 06:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
actually fact what's constitutional and
 
06:32:25.730 --> 06:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
whatever thank you very much I would
 
06:32:25.740 --> 06:32:26.510 align:start position:0%
whatever thank you very much I would
support

06:32:26.510 --> 06:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:32:28.628 --> 06:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
OTP thank you
 
06:32:31.070 --> 06:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:32:35.570 --> 06:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:38.390 --> 06:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
06:32:40.010 --> 06:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
um something that hasn't been touched on
 
06:32:43.070 --> 06:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
but I thought of is let's think of a law
 
06:32:46.010 --> 06:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement response potentially we have
 
06:32:49.010 --> 06:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
someone who's in a psychotic break or in
 
06:32:49.020 --> 06:32:50.150 align:start position:0%
someone who's in a psychotic break or in
crisis

06:32:50.150 --> 06:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
06:32:52.250 --> 06:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
and someone has just turned them in that
 
06:32:54.350 --> 06:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
they want their guns taken away
 
06:32:56.750 --> 06:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
you think the law enforcement agency is
 
06:32:57.890 --> 06:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
going to go knocking on the door
 
06:33:00.650 --> 06:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
politely think about the response that
 
06:33:02.208 --> 06:33:02.218 align:start position:0%
they have to make
 
06:33:05.270 --> 06:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
and now you're putting law enforcement
 
06:33:07.730 --> 06:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
potentially In Harm's Way
 
06:33:10.310 --> 06:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
over this as well only to find out it's
 
06:33:12.530 --> 06:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
an ex-husband who's pissed off we all
 
06:33:14.868 --> 06:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
know ex-husbands don't lie
 
06:33:18.890 --> 06:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
so the the the potential for abuse the
 
06:33:20.390 --> 06:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
06:33:22.368 --> 06:33:22.378 align:start position:0%
putting life with them at Jeopardy for
 
06:33:24.890 --> 06:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
someone who wants to kill himself why
 
06:33:27.170 --> 06:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
why instead of one person dead now
 
06:33:30.170 --> 06:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
you've got three makes no sense as well
 
06:33:33.230 --> 06:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
as innocent until proven guilty not
 
06:33:37.430 --> 06:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
guilty until proven innocent thank you
 
06:33:45.530 --> 06:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:04.670 --> 06:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:06.708 --> 06:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
just as a friendly reminder we are
 
06:34:08.090 --> 06:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
limiting testimony to two minutes
 
06:34:10.010 --> 06:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
everybody's doing a fantastic job thank
 
06:34:10.020 --> 06:34:12.650 align:start position:0%
everybody's doing a fantastic job thank
you

06:34:12.650 --> 06:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:12.660 --> 06:34:16.850 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:34:16.850 --> 06:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:19.190 --> 06:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm John Bunker I live in
 
06:34:21.230 --> 06:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
Stratham New Hampshire
 
06:34:24.770 --> 06:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
I strongly support this bill
 
06:34:27.830 --> 06:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I support it for two reasons
 
06:34:30.048 --> 06:34:30.058 align:start position:0%
it is rational
 
06:34:32.030 --> 06:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
it is reasonable
 
06:34:34.070 --> 06:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it's common sense
 
06:34:36.708 --> 06:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
19 other states have also thought the
 
06:34:36.718 --> 06:34:38.390 align:start position:0%
19 other states have also thought the
same

06:34:38.390 --> 06:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:34:40.788 --> 06:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
I have a handout for you
 
06:34:43.910 --> 06:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
and this is from the Johns Hopkins
 
06:34:46.850 --> 06:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
Center for gun violence and solutions
 
06:34:49.670 --> 06:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's uh what we refer to in the academic
 
06:34:52.190 --> 06:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
world is a literature review of
 
06:34:54.170 --> 06:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
public policy
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
in this particular one has 17 references
 
06:34:59.330 --> 06:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
that are peer reviewed on this
 
06:35:01.070 --> 06:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
particular law
 
06:35:04.010 --> 06:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you as you deliberate
 
06:35:06.948 --> 06:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
the testimony you've heard to refer to
 
06:35:09.230 --> 06:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
these citations
 
06:35:11.628 --> 06:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
to get an appreciation for the research
 
06:35:13.970 --> 06:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's going into this field and I'll
 
06:35:15.948 --> 06:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
end with a quote from a researcher at
 
06:35:17.750 --> 06:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
Johns Hopkins
 
06:35:20.570 --> 06:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
when I look at the landscape of gun
 
06:35:23.448 --> 06:35:23.458 align:start position:0%
violence prevention policy in this
 
06:35:23.458 --> 06:35:24.650 align:start position:0%
violence prevention policy in this
country

06:35:24.650 --> 06:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:35:27.350 --> 06:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the possibilities in the progress
 
06:35:29.628 --> 06:35:29.638 align:start position:0%
I'm very hopeful
 
06:35:32.510 --> 06:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
by bringing science to policy
 
06:35:35.090 --> 06:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
we're getting good new laws that are
 
06:35:37.548 --> 06:35:37.558 align:start position:0%
making a difference in our communities
 
06:35:40.850 --> 06:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
every day and this is a prime example
 
06:35:48.470 --> 06:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:53.150 --> 06:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:57.470 --> 06:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I just had a quick note here um so
 
06:36:00.948 --> 06:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 106. so when looking at his
 
06:36:04.190 --> 06:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
historical uh American history the
 
06:36:06.590 --> 06:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
government was formed to serve the
 
06:36:09.288 --> 06:36:09.298 align:start position:0%
people and if the government wasn't
 
06:36:10.788 --> 06:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
serving a people it was the duty of the
 
06:36:13.128 --> 06:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
government to handle the situation to
 
06:36:14.868 --> 06:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
remove those not serving the people
 
06:36:19.070 --> 06:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
which means that the there's a risk of
 
06:36:20.810 --> 06:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
the government official losing her job
 
06:36:24.410 --> 06:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
because of the civilians well this bill
 
06:36:26.270 --> 06:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
is trying to flip that on its side The
 
06:36:28.490 --> 06:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
Government Can intervene into your life
 
06:36:30.948 --> 06:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
and take away your rights because of
 
06:36:32.510 --> 06:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
somebody said so and that somebody said
 
06:36:34.850 --> 06:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
so it could be neighbor friend former
 
06:36:37.010 --> 06:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
friend lover or another government
 
06:36:39.890 --> 06:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
official but because you don't know you
 
06:36:41.810 --> 06:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
have no recourse you have no it could it
 
06:36:43.368 --> 06:36:43.378 align:start position:0%
could allow for government to just
 
06:36:45.230 --> 06:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
intervene in your life and
 
06:36:47.208 --> 06:36:47.218 align:start position:0%
there's nothing you can do about it and
 
06:36:50.868 --> 06:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
therefore I suggest uh itl uh 106. thank
 
06:36:50.878 --> 06:36:53.208 align:start position:0%
therefore I suggest uh itl uh 106. thank
you

06:36:53.208 --> 06:36:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:57.850 --> 06:36:57.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:04.670 --> 06:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:06.770 --> 06:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
okay start the timer
 
06:37:06.780 --> 06:37:08.330 align:start position:0%
okay start the timer
um

06:37:08.330 --> 06:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:09.708 --> 06:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
Johanna from Governors New Hampshire
 
06:37:11.270 --> 06:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be brief I'm going to be
 
06:37:12.350 --> 06:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
quick but that's not to be a
 
06:37:14.150 --> 06:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
disrespectful topic it's a serious topic
 
06:37:14.160 --> 06:37:15.288 align:start position:0%
disrespectful topic it's a serious topic
so

06:37:15.288 --> 06:37:15.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:37:18.170 --> 06:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to run through this uh no
 
06:37:19.788 --> 06:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
adequate due process protections are
 
06:37:21.410 --> 06:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
less reliable
 
06:37:21.420 --> 06:37:22.190 align:start position:0%
less reliable
um

06:37:22.190 --> 06:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:24.470 --> 06:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason for a person to
 
06:37:25.850 --> 06:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
participate in their accident to be
 
06:37:27.288 --> 06:37:27.298 align:start position:0%
required to be at their their hearing
 
06:37:28.788 --> 06:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
then they can remove have their firearms
 
06:37:30.590 --> 06:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
removed and their rights lost but there
 
06:37:32.510 --> 06:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
is a hearing required to regain their
 
06:37:34.368 --> 06:37:34.378 align:start position:0%
property after the protection order has
 
06:37:36.530 --> 06:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
ended which does not make sense
 
06:37:38.208 --> 06:37:38.218 align:start position:0%
uh there's an increased potential
 
06:37:40.430 --> 06:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
increased risk to innocence uh in the
 
06:37:42.230 --> 06:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
respondent and possibly Law Enforcement
 
06:37:43.730 --> 06:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
Officers by increasing the chance of a
 
06:37:45.770 --> 06:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
violent encounter uh we've heard of
 
06:37:47.510 --> 06:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
cases where just mental health checks
 
06:37:48.590 --> 06:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
where someone goes in because someone
 
06:37:50.390 --> 06:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
was threatening to harm to themselves or
 
06:37:52.070 --> 06:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
others and there's a recent case in New
 
06:37:53.868 --> 06:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where a young man died I don't
 
06:37:55.070 --> 06:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
believe there's a firearm involved on
 
06:37:57.890 --> 06:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
his part but they don't show up to you
 
06:37:59.570 --> 06:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
know they're there to protect their
 
06:38:01.010 --> 06:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
safety and sometimes people die when
 
06:38:02.270 --> 06:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
that happens it could be the officers it
 
06:38:04.310 --> 06:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
could be the respondent
 
06:38:06.890 --> 06:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
um this is reminiscent of the 2002 movie
 
06:38:08.990 --> 06:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
Minority Report uh it's about pre-crime
 
06:38:10.670 --> 06:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have uh anything that
 
06:38:12.470 --> 06:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
in our laws anywhere that you lose your
 
06:38:14.448 --> 06:38:14.458 align:start position:0%
rights before you've committed any crime
 
06:38:16.610 --> 06:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
or violation just or even the threat you
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to threaten actual violence
 
06:38:20.150 --> 06:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
or commit a crime you can still be
 
06:38:21.830 --> 06:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
convicted in the sen they don't call it
 
06:38:23.390 --> 06:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
a conviction obviously but you are
 
06:38:25.490 --> 06:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
losing a constitutionally guaranteed
 
06:38:28.610 --> 06:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
right uh social media and other things
 
06:38:29.510 --> 06:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
can be used against someone they're
 
06:38:31.010 --> 06:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
using other states against people to
 
06:38:32.208 --> 06:38:32.218 align:start position:0%
even attain their rights in the first
 
06:38:32.218 --> 06:38:33.948 align:start position:0%
even attain their rights in the first
place

06:38:33.948 --> 06:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:38:36.230 --> 06:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and as you heard from another veteran
 
06:38:37.430 --> 06:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
and some other people spoke about the
 
06:38:39.170 --> 06:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
less likelihood of seeking psychiatric
 
06:38:39.180 --> 06:38:40.128 align:start position:0%
less likelihood of seeking psychiatric
help

06:38:40.128 --> 06:38:40.138 align:start position:0%
help
 
06:38:41.690 --> 06:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
um people will be less likely to talk
 
06:38:42.770 --> 06:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
about the problems they have if they're
 
06:38:43.970 --> 06:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
worried about losing their rights
 
06:38:43.980 --> 06:38:44.930 align:start position:0%
worried about losing their rights
possibly

06:38:44.930 --> 06:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
06:38:48.770 --> 06:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
and lastly I mean rumor has it that uh
 
06:38:50.270 --> 06:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
you know Abel and his parents were
 
06:38:51.770 --> 06:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
concerned about Kane's mental health so
 
06:38:54.110 --> 06:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
they had his Spears removed we all know
 
06:38:56.330 --> 06:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
what happened after that so removing one
 
06:38:58.190 --> 06:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
thing that is potentially dangerous is
 
06:38:59.990 --> 06:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
not necessarily an answer to preventing
 
06:39:02.090 --> 06:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
a violent crime or some harm to someone
 
06:39:04.250 --> 06:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
or another uh if someone commits a crime
 
06:39:06.948 --> 06:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
obviously they need to be dealt with and
 
06:39:08.750 --> 06:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
deal with the consequences but pre-crime
 
06:39:10.670 --> 06:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
is something that none of us should be
 
06:39:13.070 --> 06:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
addressing in this in this chamber or in
 
06:39:15.650 --> 06:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
any government thank you
 
06:39:18.470 --> 06:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and the
 
06:39:28.850 --> 06:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:30.948 --> 06:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity for
 
06:39:33.708 --> 06:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
letting me sneak in last moment my name
 
06:39:35.930 --> 06:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
is Jonathan Weinberg I'm a member of the
 
06:39:38.270 --> 06:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
Concord school board however I'm here in
 
06:39:40.490 --> 06:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
my capacity as an individual on behalf
 
06:39:42.230 --> 06:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the board
 
06:39:45.590 --> 06:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
I guess does wearing a seat belt prevent
 
06:39:47.628 --> 06:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
death no
 
06:39:50.510 --> 06:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
does wearing a helmet absolutely prevent
 
06:39:52.670 --> 06:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
brain injury no
 
06:39:54.708 --> 06:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
does holding a knife down while walking
 
06:39:57.048 --> 06:39:57.058 align:start position:0%
in a kitchen absolutely ensure that no
 
06:39:58.548 --> 06:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
one is hurt by it
 
06:39:58.558 --> 06:39:59.868 align:start position:0%
one is hurt by it
now

06:39:59.868 --> 06:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:40:02.868 --> 06:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
yet we don't wear a seat belt or a
 
06:40:05.930 --> 06:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
helmet or practice safe knife handling
 
06:40:08.208 --> 06:40:08.218 align:start position:0%
because we know the outcome
 
06:40:10.490 --> 06:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
we know they are designed to minimize
 
06:40:13.548 --> 06:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
the risk of a dangerous outcome
 
06:40:16.730 --> 06:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
no bills no law will completely change
 
06:40:19.310 --> 06:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
the reality that too many people are
 
06:40:21.890 --> 06:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
dying at the hands of gun violence
 
06:40:24.650 --> 06:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
but if you believe that like the other
 
06:40:27.830 --> 06:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
safeguards the helmets the seat belts
 
06:40:30.708 --> 06:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
and that this bill is proactively trying
 
06:40:33.470 --> 06:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
to address a real Challenge and save
 
06:40:36.470 --> 06:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
lives then I urge you to vote ought to
 
06:40:40.910 --> 06:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:43.128 --> 06:40:43.138 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and the
 
06:40:47.110 --> 06:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Dr Michael

um

06:40:58.250 --> 06:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:58.260 --> 06:40:59.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:40:59.390 --> 06:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:41:01.070 --> 06:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
for those of you who watch the State of
 
06:41:02.570 --> 06:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
the Union the other night
 
06:41:05.448 --> 06:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
Joe Biden talked about ending no knock
 
06:41:07.970 --> 06:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
warrants and yet here we are listening
 
06:41:09.708 --> 06:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
to testimony advocating no knock
 
06:41:11.510 --> 06:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
warrants I'm going to go through a brief
 
06:41:13.190 --> 06:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
history and in less than two minutes I
 
06:41:16.670 --> 06:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:19.010 --> 06:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
this country we've heard so much about
 
06:41:22.190 --> 06:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
systemic racism in this country nowhere
 
06:41:25.670 --> 06:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
is it more apparent nowhere is systemic
 
06:41:28.490 --> 06:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
racism more apparent than in gun control
 
06:41:30.530 --> 06:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
you can go back and look at the Dred
 
06:41:32.868 --> 06:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
Scott case specifically the words of
 
06:41:34.730 --> 06:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice Taney which I will not
 
06:41:36.708 --> 06:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
repeat you can look at the words of
 
06:41:40.190 --> 06:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Shields from Tennessee if you
 
06:41:41.810 --> 06:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
think the word Common Sense gun control
 
06:41:43.730 --> 06:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
you should be proud of using it today in
 
06:41:47.390 --> 06:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
2023 go look at his words it is right
 
06:41:48.948 --> 06:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
out of Jim Crow
 
06:41:51.830 --> 06:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely horrible unfortunately
 
06:41:53.690 --> 06:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
the United States exported gun control
 
06:41:56.990 --> 06:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
to Germany to Weimar Germany very
 
06:41:59.448 --> 06:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
Progressive State incredibly Progressive
 
06:42:02.930 --> 06:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
State thank you President Wilson
 
06:42:04.788 --> 06:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
following Weimar Germany we got the
 
06:42:07.128 --> 06:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
national socialists of Germany who very
 
06:42:10.430 --> 06:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
very effectively used a red flag law to
 
06:42:12.830 --> 06:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
disarm the undesirables which went far
 
06:42:15.590 --> 06:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
beyond the Jews it included gays the
 
06:42:17.868 --> 06:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
undesirables the not good Nazis of
 
06:42:17.878 --> 06:42:19.788 align:start position:0%
undesirables the not good Nazis of
society

06:42:19.788 --> 06:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
society
 
06:42:23.090 --> 06:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
over the past 10 years unfortunately the
 
06:42:25.070 --> 06:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
gun control policies that have been
 
06:42:26.810 --> 06:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
advanced in New Hampshire have not
 
06:42:28.490 --> 06:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
differentiated from what was used in
 
06:42:31.850 --> 06:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
Nazi Germany at all which is truly truly
 
06:42:33.230 --> 06:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
a tragedy
 
06:42:36.590 --> 06:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
this brings me to my requests in 2012
 
06:42:38.570 --> 06:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Vaillancourt was
 
06:42:41.150 --> 06:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
censured by this body for saying Z Kyle
 
06:42:43.490 --> 06:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
to then speaker of the house I thought
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
it was the right thing to do because I
 
06:42:46.670 --> 06:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
think Nazis all socialists are
 
06:42:49.610 --> 06:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely abhorrent
 
06:42:51.230 --> 06:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's still on his record he's
 
06:42:53.510 --> 06:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately passed away if you are
 
06:42:55.610 --> 06:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
going to advance this if you're going to
 
06:42:56.990 --> 06:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
spread Jim Crow and you're going to
 
06:42:58.910 --> 06:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
advance the policies of Nazi Germany
 
06:43:02.090 --> 06:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
please vindicate the late representative
 
06:43:04.610 --> 06:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
and honorable Steve Vaillancourt and
 
06:43:07.070 --> 06:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
remove the censure from him for uttering
 
06:43:09.770 --> 06:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
those words in this Hall thank you
 
06:43:09.780 --> 06:43:12.830 align:start position:0%
those words in this Hall thank you
foreign

06:43:12.830 --> 06:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:20.270 --> 06:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:22.430 --> 06:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
oh hi ladies and gentlemen thank you
 
06:43:23.990 --> 06:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
again for your time
 
06:43:26.570 --> 06:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
um I present myself through support and
 
06:43:29.030 --> 06:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
defend the Constitution which this
 
06:43:31.850 --> 06:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
legislative body is sworn to uphold
 
06:43:34.190 --> 06:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
but let me be let me disclose an
 
06:43:36.708 --> 06:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and hidden truth the
 
06:43:39.890 --> 06:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
legislature has no power of rule making
 
06:43:42.948 --> 06:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
or legislation that would impair our
 
06:43:46.250 --> 06:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights in fact this body has
 
06:43:49.128 --> 06:43:49.138 align:start position:0%
never made any statute directly
 
06:43:51.110 --> 06:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the right of the people to
 
06:43:53.330 --> 06:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
keep and bear arms take note of the
 
06:43:54.830 --> 06:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
Fallen United States Supreme Court
 
06:43:57.730 --> 06:43:57.740 align:start position:0%
decision in Miranda versus Arizona
 
06:44:00.470 --> 06:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
1990-1966 stating
 
06:44:03.110 --> 06:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're right secured by the Constitution
 
06:44:06.350 --> 06:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
are are involved there can be no
 
06:44:09.288 --> 06:44:09.298 align:start position:0%
rulemaking or legislation which would
 
06:44:10.850 --> 06:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
abrogate them
 
06:44:13.128 --> 06:44:13.138 align:start position:0%
next we have the the newest decision
 
06:44:15.170 --> 06:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
from 2022
 
06:44:19.070 --> 06:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
wherein quoting DC versus Heller
 
06:44:22.070 --> 06:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
that Bruin Court stated that the Second
 
06:44:24.650 --> 06:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment is the very product of an
 
06:44:27.708 --> 06:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
interest balancing by the people and
 
06:44:29.750 --> 06:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
surely it elevates above all other
 
06:44:32.570 --> 06:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
interests the right of law-abiding
 
06:44:35.990 --> 06:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
responsible citizens for arm or to use
 
06:44:38.330 --> 06:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
arms for defense
 
06:44:40.190 --> 06:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
that said
 
06:44:43.670 --> 06:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
in 1943 the Supreme Court also wrote
 
06:44:45.770 --> 06:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
that the very purpose of the Bill of
 
06:44:49.010 --> 06:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
Rights was to withdraw certain subjects
 
06:44:52.570 --> 06:44:52.580 align:start position:0%
from The Vicious from from the this into
 
06:44:56.448 --> 06:44:56.458 align:start position:0%
aciditudes of political controversy
 
06:44:58.788 --> 06:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
to place them beyond the reach of
 
06:45:01.250 --> 06:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
majorities and officials and to
 
06:45:03.530 --> 06:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
establish them as legal principles to be
 
06:45:06.830 --> 06:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
guided by the courts one's fundamental
 
06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
right may not be submitted to a vote
 
06:45:12.410 --> 06:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
they depend on the outcome of no
 
06:45:12.420 --> 06:45:14.270 align:start position:0%
they depend on the outcome of no
elections

06:45:14.270 --> 06:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
elections
 
06:45:16.690 --> 06:45:16.700 align:start position:0%
again you can confirm this for yourself
 
06:45:19.430 --> 06:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
as no statute
 
06:45:22.430 --> 06:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
has ever been written by this body
 
06:45:24.470 --> 06:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
that directed its subject matter
 
06:45:27.470 --> 06:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction against the right of the
 
06:45:30.948 --> 06:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
people to keep and bear arms that is the
 
06:45:33.708 --> 06:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
words to keep and bear arms are totally
 
06:45:36.110 --> 06:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
absent from the so-called
 
06:45:38.628 --> 06:45:38.638 align:start position:0%

06:46:53.990 --> 06:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
review report issued last week suicide
 
06:46:55.730 --> 06:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
was the cause of death for over 23
 
06:46:57.650 --> 06:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
percent of our residents
 
06:46:59.990 --> 06:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
age 1 to 21
 
06:47:03.770 --> 06:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
between 2017 and 2021
 
06:47:07.610 --> 06:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
and 38 of those suicides were gun deaths
 
06:47:10.610 --> 06:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
finding reasonable and practical ways to
 
06:47:12.770 --> 06:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
help prevent those deaths is part of my
 
06:47:15.468 --> 06:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
mission personally and professionally
 
06:47:16.850 --> 06:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
and as a member of the suicide
 
06:47:18.530 --> 06:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
prevention Council
 
06:47:22.788 --> 06:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill 106 is one such solution
 
06:47:25.070 --> 06:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
we all know that mental health issues
 
06:47:27.650 --> 06:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
especially among children and teens
 
06:47:30.770 --> 06:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
spiked in the past three years
 
06:47:34.430 --> 06:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
following the shutdowns in isolation
 
06:47:37.010 --> 06:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
of the covid-19 pandemic
 
06:47:39.288 --> 06:47:39.298 align:start position:0%
we also know that the state has a severe
 
06:47:40.910 --> 06:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage in the health care
 
06:47:40.920 --> 06:47:42.590 align:start position:0%

Arena
 
06:47:44.390 --> 06:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
and that extends to the Community Mental
 
06:47:45.708 --> 06:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
Health System
 
06:47:47.330 --> 06:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
we are struggling to ensure that
 
06:47:49.190 --> 06:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
everyone in all our communities gets the

06:47:52.968 --> 06:47:52.978 align:start position:0%
they need when they need it
 
06:47:55.490 --> 06:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
as you have already heard from others 19
 
06:47:57.350 --> 06:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
states in the District of Columbia now
 
06:47:59.750 --> 06:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
have so-called red flag laws
 
06:48:01.670 --> 06:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
and in New England all our neighboring
 
06:48:05.270 --> 06:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
states except for Maine have acted these
 
06:48:05.280 --> 06:48:06.708 align:start position:0%
states except for Maine have acted these
laws

06:48:06.708 --> 06:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
laws
 
06:48:09.468 --> 06:48:09.478 align:start position:0%
main passed a yellow flag law in 2019
 
06:48:11.150 --> 06:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
which was a compromise with the
 
06:48:12.590 --> 06:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
Sportsman's groups
 
06:48:14.810 --> 06:48:14.820 align:start position:0%
and which is still being evaluated for
 
06:48:17.390 --> 06:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
its effectiveness
 
06:48:19.368 --> 06:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
that's your time
 
06:48:21.288 --> 06:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
thank you if you want you can submit
 
06:48:23.448 --> 06:48:23.458 align:start position:0%
written testimony if you have more thank
 
06:48:25.368 --> 06:48:25.378 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
06:48:39.830 --> 06:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:42.048 --> 06:48:42.058 align:start position:0%
thank you for your perseverance and a
 
06:48:44.930 --> 06:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
long day I'm Penny Dean from Concord New
 
06:48:47.930 --> 06:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm sad to say that this
 
06:48:50.628 --> 06:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
12-page bill or I'm sorry
 
06:48:53.810 --> 06:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
um 106 FM of 12 Pages needs to be itl
 
06:48:56.270 --> 06:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
because of the time limit I won't be
 
06:48:59.330 --> 06:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
able to pre point out probably five
 
06:49:03.110 --> 06:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:05.990 --> 06:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
closer sorry because of the time limit I
 
06:49:08.390 --> 06:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
won't be able to point out not even five
 
06:49:10.610 --> 06:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
percent of the flaws and there's serious
 
06:49:12.830 --> 06:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
flaws when we talk about the New York
 
06:49:15.350 --> 06:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
case yes it was found on second
 
06:49:18.048 --> 06:49:18.058 align:start position:0%
constitutional but how much blood sweat
 
06:49:20.868 --> 06:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
tears and money did the plaintiffs have
 
06:49:23.330 --> 06:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
to do to do that you guys are supposed
 
06:49:26.270 --> 06:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
to be our first line of defense
 
06:49:28.250 --> 06:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to pass legislation
 
06:49:29.868 --> 06:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
and say Let them fight it out in the
 
06:49:31.730 --> 06:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
courts that's not right
 
06:49:33.650 --> 06:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
people like me can do that but what
 
06:49:35.330 --> 06:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
about the average person that's just
 
06:49:37.070 --> 06:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
going to destroy their life and destroy
 
06:49:38.448 --> 06:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
their finances
 
06:49:41.208 --> 06:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
start with the very beginning this bill
 
06:49:43.190 --> 06:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
deserves a black ribbon not a blue
 
06:49:45.708 --> 06:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
ribbon a black ribbon if you look at
 
06:49:47.208 --> 06:49:47.218 align:start position:0%
page two
 
06:49:51.530 --> 06:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
line six seven and eight that is the
 
06:49:54.288 --> 06:49:54.298 align:start position:0%
first section which talks about
 
06:49:56.390 --> 06:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
proceedings under this chapter may be
 
06:49:58.250 --> 06:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
transferred to another Court upon the
 
06:50:00.770 --> 06:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
motion of any party
 
06:50:03.410 --> 06:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
or the court is the interest of Justice
 
06:50:06.230 --> 06:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
requires there's two famous United
 
06:50:08.270 --> 06:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
States Supreme Court cases international
 
06:50:11.390 --> 06:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
shoe and Kokomo tire and they talk about
 
06:50:11.400 --> 06:50:12.948 align:start position:0%
shoe and Kokomo tire and they talk about
jurisdiction

06:50:12.948 --> 06:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
06:50:15.230 --> 06:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
so what if I'm in Concord New Hampshire
 
06:50:17.150 --> 06:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
and what if someone files one against me
 
06:50:18.530 --> 06:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
and they say we want it to be heard in
 
06:50:20.090 --> 06:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
coax County because it's more convenient
 
06:50:21.048 --> 06:50:21.058 align:start position:0%
for us
 
06:50:23.628 --> 06:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
should I behold into coax County I don't
 
06:50:25.850 --> 06:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
ever go to Cross County but yet that's
 
06:50:27.530 --> 06:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen here what's going
 
06:50:29.570 --> 06:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
to cost me to litigate and travel up
 
06:50:33.110 --> 06:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
there that's huge next what other states
 
06:50:35.810 --> 06:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
do I don't give a fake about other
 
06:50:37.850 --> 06:50:37.860 align:start position:0%
states don't have seat belt laws I mean
 
06:50:39.708 --> 06:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
do have them and we don't guess what
 
06:50:40.968 --> 06:50:40.978 align:start position:0%
we're different
 
06:50:43.310 --> 06:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
helmet laws I don't care what the other
 
06:50:45.890 --> 06:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
states have not my
 
06:50:49.310 --> 06:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
because they plan to be sillies no but
 
06:50:51.708 --> 06:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is there's two things
 
06:50:53.030 --> 06:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
you have to know
 
06:50:55.430 --> 06:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
I don't want to use the word never but I
 
06:50:57.708 --> 06:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
don't recall ever in 22 plus years of
 
06:51:01.250 --> 06:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
practice seeing anything but an ex parte
 
06:51:04.128 --> 06:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
order coming down number one ex parte
 
06:51:06.110 --> 06:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
which means one side gets to go and tell
 
06:51:08.448 --> 06:51:08.458 align:start position:0%
the judge their side for a temporary
 
06:51:11.150 --> 06:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
order now once these orders these are
 
06:51:12.948 --> 06:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
one year orders so everyone says oh
 
06:51:15.770 --> 06:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
these are temporary if it's you one year
 
06:51:18.410 --> 06:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
is not temporary I can tell you that and
 
06:51:21.350 --> 06:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
after the one year judges automatically
 
06:51:24.110 --> 06:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
rubber stamp another year and another
 
06:51:26.930 --> 06:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
year and another year the other thing is
 
06:51:29.750 --> 06:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
I have never once seen a person who
 
06:51:32.110 --> 06:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
committed perjury prosecuted for this
 
06:51:35.330 --> 06:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
prosecutors have absolute prosecutorial
 
06:51:37.788 --> 06:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
discretion and I've heard everyone say
 
06:51:41.690 --> 06:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
to me I can't prosecute a victim and I
 
06:51:45.170 --> 06:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
think you need to look at page three
 
06:51:47.270 --> 06:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
which is another highlights of bad
 
06:51:47.280 --> 06:51:48.410 align:start position:0%
which is another highlights of bad
things

06:51:48.410 --> 06:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:51:50.868 --> 06:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
lines seven and eight
 
06:51:53.448 --> 06:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
they appeal to the superior court of
 
06:51:56.030 --> 06:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
Errors along again Hoover wrote this
 
06:51:57.350 --> 06:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
looks like they took a bunch of bad
 
06:51:58.850 --> 06:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
bills and threw them together and don't
 
06:52:00.530 --> 06:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
understand how the mechanics work and
 
06:52:02.510 --> 06:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm only pointing out the big things
 
06:52:06.350 --> 06:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
because of time the other things can I
 
06:52:08.510 --> 06:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
say two one sentence just one sentence
 
06:52:13.430 --> 06:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay if you look at lines 21 and lines
 
06:52:17.868 --> 06:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
28 and line three you were told
 
06:52:21.468 --> 06:52:21.478 align:start position:0%
it was a certain standard right here you
 
06:52:23.628 --> 06:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
see preponderance of the evidence
 
06:52:25.670 --> 06:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
so don't believe what people are telling
 
06:52:28.610 --> 06:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
you read the bill and it's a bad bad bad
 
06:52:28.620 --> 06:52:31.190 align:start position:0%
you read the bill and it's a bad bad bad
Bill

06:52:31.190 --> 06:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:35.810 --> 06:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:39.410 --> 06:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
with that anyone else have a card
 
06:52:43.670 --> 06:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
going once going twice closed
 
06:52:45.770 --> 06:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
um house bill
 
06:52:48.590 --> 06:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
106 is closed and now I open the public
 
06:52:53.048 --> 06:52:53.058 align:start position:0%
hearing House Bill 351 and I recognize
 
06:52:55.190 --> 06:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative David Muse to introduce
 
06:53:01.128 --> 06:53:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:05.330 --> 06:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:07.910 --> 06:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor representative Muse you
 
06:53:10.010 --> 06:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
are not limited to the two minutes
 
06:53:22.070 --> 06:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:24.350 --> 06:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:53:28.128 --> 06:53:28.138 align:start position:0%
there are a few tragedies greater
 
06:53:30.110 --> 06:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
than the negligent death or injury of a
 
06:53:32.448 --> 06:53:32.458 align:start position:0%
child or another innocent person
 
06:53:35.090 --> 06:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
as a result of a firearm being left and
 
06:53:35.100 --> 06:53:36.830 align:start position:0%
as a result of a firearm being left and
attended

06:53:36.830 --> 06:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
attended
 
06:53:40.070 --> 06:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
while HP 351 won't end all of these
 
06:53:42.708 --> 06:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
tragedies it will reduce the risk of
 
06:53:44.208 --> 06:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
them happening
 
06:53:47.570 --> 06:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
as many of you will recall in 2019 an 11
 
06:53:49.548 --> 06:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
year old child from Alton was arrested
 
06:53:51.170 --> 06:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
for shooting and killing his parents
 
06:53:54.048 --> 06:53:54.058 align:start position:0%
with an unsecured firearm
 
06:53:57.070 --> 06:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
last month in Virginia a six-year-old
 
06:54:00.048 --> 06:54:00.058 align:start position:0%
boy brought his mother's unsecured and
 
06:54:02.570 --> 06:54:02.580 align:start position:0%

incidents involving suicide or Firearms

injuries involving children are often
 
06:55:16.190 --> 06:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
kept confidential by law enforcement
 
06:55:18.110 --> 06:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
the department of safety has told me
 
06:55:20.150 --> 06:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't collect or report this
 
06:55:22.430 --> 06:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
data in a centralized way
 
06:55:25.190 --> 06:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
depending on jurisdiction incidents may
 
06:55:26.990 --> 06:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
be handled by State Police County
 
06:55:29.690 --> 06:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
Sheriffs or local police this makes it
 
06:55:31.850 --> 06:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to examine New
 
06:55:34.070 --> 06:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire incidents from a data-driven
 
06:55:36.410 --> 06:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
perspective it's also hard to get
 
06:55:39.170 --> 06:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information because newspapers
 
06:55:41.090 --> 06:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
and media elements are very protective
 
06:55:43.310 --> 06:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
of the privacy of minors and their
 
06:55:43.320 --> 06:55:44.770 align:start position:0%
of the privacy of minors and their
parents

06:55:44.770 --> 06:55:44.780 align:start position:0%
parents
 
06:55:48.110 --> 06:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
many times if we hear of an incident at
 
06:55:51.948 --> 06:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
all we tend to hear a bit as a as an
 
06:55:53.690 --> 06:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
unreported shooting where a child might
 
06:55:55.730 --> 06:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
be involved and that's the last we hear
 
06:55:57.788 --> 06:55:57.798 align:start position:0%
of it
 
06:56:01.070 --> 06:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is unsecured Firearms
 
06:56:03.350 --> 06:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
pose significant safety risks especially
 
06:56:05.330 --> 06:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
to children
 
06:56:07.128 --> 06:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
the American Journal admitted the
 
06:56:08.448 --> 06:56:08.458 align:start position:0%
Journal of the American Medical
 
06:56:11.570 --> 06:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
Association reported that 70 percent of
 
06:56:13.810 --> 06:56:13.820 align:start position:0%
parents surveyed reported their children
 
06:56:16.788 --> 06:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
had no independent access to firearms in
 
06:56:18.890 --> 06:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
their household but over a third of the
 
06:56:20.330 --> 06:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
children actually living in those
 
06:56:22.850 --> 06:56:22.860 align:start position:0%
households reported being able to access
 
06:56:27.110 --> 06:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
a firearm in less than five minutes
 
06:56:29.868 --> 06:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it requires
 
06:56:31.730 --> 06:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
that Firearms sold their transferred
 
06:56:33.948 --> 06:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
commercially or privately be accompanied
 
06:56:36.890 --> 06:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
by a locking safety device that
 
06:56:38.810 --> 06:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
specifically designed or manufactured
 
06:56:41.270 --> 06:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of allowing the owner to
 
06:56:44.448 --> 06:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
temporarily disable or safely store the
 
06:56:44.458 --> 06:56:45.650 align:start position:0%
temporarily disable or safely store the
firearm

06:56:45.650 --> 06:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
06:56:48.708 --> 06:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
the bill also gives the buyer the option
 
06:56:51.048 --> 06:56:51.058 align:start position:0%
of complying with the law by bringing
 
06:56:53.510 --> 06:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
their own locking safety device when
 
06:56:56.868 --> 06:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
they take ownership of the firearm
 
06:56:58.850 --> 06:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
the bill also strengthens New
 
06:57:01.128 --> 06:57:01.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's existing firearm storage
 
06:57:05.330 --> 06:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
negligence law that's RSA 650 C1 by
 
06:57:07.010 --> 06:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
doing several things
 
06:57:09.490 --> 06:57:09.500 align:start position:0%
it expands the scope of the law to cover
 
06:57:12.230 --> 06:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
unattended firearms that are unloaded
 
06:57:15.468 --> 06:57:15.478 align:start position:0%
but where unsecured ammunition is also
 
06:57:17.150 --> 06:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
available to the child
 
06:57:19.490 --> 06:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
the current law only addresses loaded
 
06:57:19.500 --> 06:57:21.048 align:start position:0%
the current law only addresses loaded
weapons

06:57:21.048 --> 06:57:21.058 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
06:57:23.390 --> 06:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
it broadens the circumstances that
 
06:57:25.548 --> 06:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
constitute an offense
 
06:57:27.770 --> 06:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
currently a gun owner who allows a child
 
06:57:30.830 --> 06:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
to gain access to an unsecured weapon is
 
06:57:32.930 --> 06:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
only charged If the child uses the gun
 
06:57:35.510 --> 06:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
in a reckless manner uses it in the
 
06:57:37.968 --> 06:57:37.978 align:start position:0%
commission of a crime or negligently or
 
06:57:40.310 --> 06:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
recklessly discharges it
 
06:57:43.610 --> 06:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
under HP 351 a child displaying a
 
06:57:45.890 --> 06:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
firearm to others would also constitute
 
06:57:47.570 --> 06:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
an offense
 
06:57:50.150 --> 06:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
additionally an offense would take place
 
06:57:52.010 --> 06:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
if the child brings the weapon onto the
 
06:57:53.810 --> 06:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
grounds of any facility public or
 
06:57:55.850 --> 06:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
private that's accessible to members of
 
06:57:57.468 --> 06:57:57.478 align:start position:0%
the public where other people are
 
06:57:57.478 --> 06:57:58.868 align:start position:0%
the public where other people are
present

06:57:58.868 --> 06:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
present
 
06:58:02.270 --> 06:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is we have a plague of
 
06:58:02.280 --> 06:58:03.530 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is we have a plague of
kids

06:58:03.530 --> 06:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
kids
 
06:58:06.230 --> 06:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
bringing unsecured Firearms into
 
06:58:08.090 --> 06:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
situations where they're not only
 
06:58:10.128 --> 06:58:10.138 align:start position:0%
endangering themselves they're
 
06:58:12.530 --> 06:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
endangering other children they're
 
06:58:16.368 --> 06:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
endangering endangering as adults uh and
 
06:58:18.170 --> 06:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
they're endangering the public
 
06:58:20.330 --> 06:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason for this
 
06:58:23.208 --> 06:58:23.218 align:start position:0%
this is not an issue of taking anybody's
 
06:58:29.810 --> 06:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:32.990 --> 06:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
helping more people understand
 
06:58:35.868 --> 06:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
what a responsibility it is to own a
 
06:58:40.310 --> 06:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
firearm especially if you have a child
 
06:58:40.320 --> 06:58:42.110 align:start position:0%
firearm especially if you have a child
um

06:58:42.110 --> 06:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:43.910 --> 06:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
I think the bill is also very clear
 
06:58:46.070 --> 06:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
about exceptions which which you can
 
06:58:48.170 --> 06:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
read yourself in the bill it doesn't
 
06:58:50.890 --> 06:58:50.900 align:start position:0%
restrict access to Firearms it doesn't
 
06:58:55.070 --> 06:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
penalize any responsible law abiding gun
 
06:58:57.770 --> 06:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
owners negligence is actually already a
 
06:58:59.628 --> 06:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
crime in our state
 
06:59:01.490 --> 06:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
what it would do is offer additional
 
06:59:03.468 --> 06:59:03.478 align:start position:0%
protection for New Hampshire children
 
06:59:06.770 --> 06:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
and something to think about is it would
 
06:59:09.770 --> 06:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
save gun owners from the horror and the
 
06:59:13.250 --> 06:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
liability that is a risk whenever an
 
06:59:17.150 --> 06:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
unsecured firearm is left around a child
 
06:59:18.830 --> 06:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
in a state where guns are part of our
 
06:59:21.410 --> 06:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
culture responsibility in protecting our
 
06:59:23.090 --> 06:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
kids from the very real danger that
 
06:59:25.610 --> 06:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
unsecured Firearms can present
 
06:59:28.310 --> 06:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
really needs to also be part of our
 
06:59:29.990 --> 06:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
culture and a stronger part of our
 
06:59:35.030 --> 06:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
culture and hopefully HP 351 will make
 
06:59:37.190 --> 06:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
it a stronger part of New Hampshire law
 
06:59:38.448 --> 06:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
as well
 
06:59:42.948 --> 06:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh please give HP 351 and not to pass
 
06:59:42.958 --> 06:59:44.208 align:start position:0%
uh please give HP 351 and not to pass
recommendation

06:59:44.208 --> 06:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
06:59:46.910 --> 06:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:49.670 --> 06:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:59:51.650 --> 06:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
and the chair calls
 
07:00:04.310 --> 07:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:05.990 --> 07:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity to testify
 
07:00:08.690 --> 07:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
this bill like previous bills attempts
 
07:00:12.110 --> 07:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
to re-classify what a private sale is
 
07:00:15.948 --> 07:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
come here this is well established it's
 
07:00:17.868 --> 07:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
a it's a theme or a problem that exists
 
07:00:20.510 --> 07:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
on several bills today this bill isn't
 
07:00:22.548 --> 07:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish anything it's a
 
07:00:28.208 --> 07:00:28.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:30.890 --> 07:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
why are we
 
07:00:32.868 --> 07:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
we're painting with a broad brush we're
 
07:00:36.410 --> 07:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
just applying additional requirements to
 
07:00:38.390 --> 07:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
a problem that doesn't currently exist
 
07:00:41.150 --> 07:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
nobody's brought forth examples where
 
07:00:43.250 --> 07:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
cable lock would solve a problem in this
 
07:00:43.260 --> 07:00:45.230 align:start position:0%
cable lock would solve a problem in this
state

07:00:45.230 --> 07:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:00:47.390 --> 07:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
I live in other states where where
 
07:00:48.948 --> 07:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
they've had these laws and it
 
07:00:51.350 --> 07:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
accomplishes nothing
 
07:00:54.048 --> 07:00:54.058 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much I urge you to to
 
07:00:56.270 --> 07:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh vote this itl
 
07:00:58.670 --> 07:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and the
 
07:01:07.850 --> 07:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:10.968 --> 07:01:10.978 align:start position:0%
the CDC stats include children up to the
 
07:01:13.548 --> 07:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
age of 19 years old the more majority of
 
07:01:15.288 --> 07:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
children that are killed with Firearms
 
07:01:17.390 --> 07:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
are gang bangers
 
07:01:17.400 --> 07:01:17.930 align:start position:0%
are gang bangers
um

07:01:17.930 --> 07:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:20.448 --> 07:01:20.458 align:start position:0%
it would be really really actually
 
07:01:22.610 --> 07:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
useful of gun controllers we're
 
07:01:24.288 --> 07:01:24.298 align:start position:0%
concerned with getting illegal guns off
 
07:01:26.090 --> 07:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
the street because there would be less
 
07:01:28.610 --> 07:01:28.620 align:start position:0%
dead children according to ages 19 and
 
07:01:28.620 --> 07:01:29.810 align:start position:0%
dead children according to ages 19 and
under

07:01:29.810 --> 07:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
under
 
07:01:31.430 --> 07:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
um also once again this is another out
 
07:01:33.468 --> 07:01:33.478 align:start position:0%
of state gun control organization that
 
07:01:35.208 --> 07:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
seeks to change existing laws in New
 
07:01:36.770 --> 07:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these out-of-state
 
07:01:38.628 --> 07:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
organizations attempt to solve problems
 
07:01:40.730 --> 07:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
that don't exist in one of the safest
 
07:01:43.010 --> 07:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
states in the country please vote in
 
07:01:46.190 --> 07:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on HB 351 there's
 
07:01:48.048 --> 07:01:48.058 align:start position:0%
no need to change the law there's
 
07:01:50.510 --> 07:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
especially no need to change the law to
 
07:01:52.128 --> 07:01:52.138 align:start position:0%
satisfy gun control organizations
 
07:01:54.708 --> 07:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
located in states that aren't nearly as
 
07:01:57.590 --> 07:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
safe as New Hampshire thank you
 
07:02:06.590 --> 07:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:11.930 --> 07:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:13.788 --> 07:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
07:02:15.948 --> 07:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
I grew up in a household where the
 
07:02:18.770 --> 07:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
shotgun was stored in the corner we knew
 
07:02:21.288 --> 07:02:21.298 align:start position:0%
where it was nobody ever touched it we
 
07:02:24.530 --> 07:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
knew better we just knew better we were
 
07:02:27.288 --> 07:02:27.298 align:start position:0%
all familiar with Firearms nobody ever
 
07:02:30.110 --> 07:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
touched it until we were 14 and able to
 
07:02:34.190 --> 07:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
take an NRA hunting hunting course then
 
07:02:35.930 --> 07:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
but it still was there
 
07:02:38.830 --> 07:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
again the the people's lack of
 
07:02:41.990 --> 07:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
understanding how how firearm
 
07:02:45.288 --> 07:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
purchases work is every gun I've ever
 
07:02:47.628 --> 07:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
bought probably in the last 20 years
 
07:02:51.468 --> 07:02:51.478 align:start position:0%
comes with a lot it comes with a lot
 
07:02:54.410 --> 07:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
we don't need to legislate you cannot
 
07:02:56.930 --> 07:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
legislate common sense you cannot
 
07:02:56.940 --> 07:02:58.850 align:start position:0%
legislate common sense you cannot
legislate

07:02:58.850 --> 07:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
07:03:02.030 --> 07:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
good behavior all you can do is make
 
07:03:04.090 --> 07:03:04.100 align:start position:0%
good citizens
 
07:03:04.100 --> 07:03:05.690 align:start position:0%
good citizens
violators

07:03:05.690 --> 07:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
violators
 
07:03:07.730 --> 07:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
I keep guns in my house I have
 
07:03:10.128 --> 07:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
grandchildren I have children when they
 
07:03:11.330 --> 07:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
come over
 
07:03:13.910 --> 07:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
believe me there's no way they can get
 
07:03:15.948 --> 07:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
it but I don't need a law to tell me to
 
07:03:17.750 --> 07:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
do that because I have half a brain
 
07:03:22.190 --> 07:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:24.288 --> 07:03:24.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
07:03:24.298 --> 07:03:25.490 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
calls

07:03:25.490 --> 07:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
calls
 
07:03:32.990 --> 07:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:37.010 --> 07:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony again
 
07:03:40.010 --> 07:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
on this bill let me start
 
07:03:42.170 --> 07:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
with just a couple of comments first
 
07:03:45.230 --> 07:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
since I've sat here and listened to all
 
07:03:48.350 --> 07:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
the testimony today
 
07:03:51.110 --> 07:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
first of all in terms of Mental Health
 
07:03:54.230 --> 07:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
people say do something about Mental
 
07:03:54.240 --> 07:03:55.310 align:start position:0%
people say do something about Mental
Health

07:03:55.310 --> 07:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
Health
 
07:03:57.890 --> 07:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
I'm a psychiatrist I'm interested in
 
07:04:01.788 --> 07:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:05.990 --> 07:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
but when we present
 
07:04:08.330 --> 07:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
possible laws
 
07:04:10.730 --> 07:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
to do something about mental health you
 
07:04:12.170 --> 07:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
say no
 
07:04:12.180 --> 07:04:12.850 align:start position:0%
say no
no

07:04:12.850 --> 07:04:12.860 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:04:15.230 --> 07:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that
 
07:04:15.240 --> 07:04:17.750 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that
so

07:04:17.750 --> 07:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:04:21.708 --> 07:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
not sure really how we can do something
 
07:04:25.208 --> 07:04:25.218 align:start position:0%
about mental health if when we present
 
07:04:28.430 --> 07:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable ideas
 
07:04:31.548 --> 07:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
about mental health the answer
 
07:04:34.788 --> 07:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
seems to always be no
 
07:04:36.590 --> 07:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
and let me talk about something about
 
07:04:40.190 --> 07:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:43.788 --> 07:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
nothing in New Hampshire law
 
07:04:46.788 --> 07:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
says anything about gun law about ghost
 
07:04:46.798 --> 07:04:48.468 align:start position:0%
says anything about gun law about ghost
guns

07:04:48.468 --> 07:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
guns
 
07:04:51.530 --> 07:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
as far as I know nothing about New
 
07:04:54.890 --> 07:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law says anything about
 
07:04:59.090 --> 07:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
turning in the names of people who are
 
07:05:02.208 --> 07:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
committed to the state hospital
 
07:05:05.448 --> 07:05:05.458 align:start position:0%
to the National Data Bank
 
07:05:08.990 --> 07:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not a constitutional issue it's
 
07:05:11.810 --> 07:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
just a reasonable issue that we're
 
07:05:14.330 --> 07:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
interested in and this has to these have
 
07:05:16.788 --> 07:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
to do with mental health now
 
07:05:19.548 --> 07:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
in terms of negligent storage of
 
07:05:19.558 --> 07:05:21.468 align:start position:0%
in terms of negligent storage of
firearms

07:05:21.468 --> 07:05:21.478 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
07:05:24.650 --> 07:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable
 
07:05:28.368 --> 07:05:28.378 align:start position:0%
for people who have a license to drive a
 
07:05:32.208 --> 07:05:32.218 align:start position:0%
car for them to do it reasonably
 
07:05:36.110 --> 07:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable for people who have guns
 
07:05:39.048 --> 07:05:39.058 align:start position:0%
to store them reasonably especially if
 
07:05:41.990 --> 07:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
they have children in the house
 
07:05:47.890 --> 07:05:47.900 align:start position:0%
now it used to be that the major most
 
07:05:50.030 --> 07:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
incidents of
 
07:05:54.110 --> 07:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
death for kids or car accidents
 
07:05:56.628 --> 07:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
but that's no longer because we have a
 
07:06:01.128 --> 07:06:01.138 align:start position:0%
lot of good laws to do something about
 
07:06:04.730 --> 07:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
child safety in cars and safety and cars
 
07:06:06.590 --> 07:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
in general that's your that's your time
 
07:06:06.600 --> 07:06:08.750 align:start position:0%
in general that's your that's your time
doctor

07:06:08.750 --> 07:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
07:06:08.760 --> 07:06:10.670 align:start position:0%
doctor
so

07:06:10.670 --> 07:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:06:13.250 --> 07:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
please let's do something about
 
07:06:16.250 --> 07:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
negligent storage of firearms thank you
 
07:06:17.930 --> 07:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
very much thank you for your testimony
 
07:06:23.448 --> 07:06:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:23.458 --> 07:06:32.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:06:32.690 --> 07:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:35.330 --> 07:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
I have more
 
07:06:38.750 --> 07:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
comments just on my testimony on this
 
07:06:38.760 --> 07:06:40.670 align:start position:0%
comments just on my testimony on this
um

07:06:40.670 --> 07:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:44.510 --> 07:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
I you know one is that most
 
07:06:46.070 --> 07:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
I I can't think of any newer
 
07:06:47.510 --> 07:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
manufactured firearm that you would
 
07:06:48.650 --> 07:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
purchase that doesn't already come with
 
07:06:51.288 --> 07:06:51.298 align:start position:0%
a cable lock so I think a lot of this is
 
07:06:53.448 --> 07:06:53.458 align:start position:0%
already happening
 
07:06:56.750 --> 07:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
um anyhow my observation with that is
 
07:06:59.510 --> 07:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
you can pass a law on it pass all the
 
07:07:01.548 --> 07:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
laws you want but somebody has to use
 
07:07:03.048 --> 07:07:03.058 align:start position:0%
that cable lock so if you get a cable
 
07:07:05.690 --> 07:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
lock somebody doesn't use it you still
 
07:07:06.770 --> 07:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
07:07:09.788 --> 07:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
the um the means of
 
07:07:12.350 --> 07:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
making the firearm inoperable to
 
07:07:14.810 --> 07:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
essentially I'm assuming this is you
 
07:07:17.570 --> 07:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
know uh primarily quite a bit aimed at
 
07:07:19.548 --> 07:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
uh preventing children from getting a
 
07:07:21.350 --> 07:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
hold of these Firearms
 
07:07:21.360 --> 07:07:22.548 align:start position:0%
hold of these Firearms
um

07:07:22.548 --> 07:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:07:25.190 --> 07:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know the the other thing uh that
 
07:07:27.350 --> 07:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
comes to mind is
 
07:07:30.230 --> 07:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
um there is already a law it's a federal
 
07:07:33.110 --> 07:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
law to the ATF and the problem of the
 
07:07:34.490 --> 07:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
gum dealers it can probably speak better
 
07:07:36.830 --> 07:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
of it to me than I can I don't I don't
 
07:07:38.810 --> 07:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
know it intimately but um you are
 
07:07:40.510 --> 07:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
federally under federal law already
 
07:07:43.368 --> 07:07:43.378 align:start position:0%
responsible I think it's called I think
 
07:07:44.690 --> 07:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
I wrote it down here at the best of my
 
07:07:47.330 --> 07:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
memory just like the child safety I
 
07:07:48.468 --> 07:07:48.478 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's protection act or
 
07:07:50.510 --> 07:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
something like that but quite often
 
07:07:52.070 --> 07:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
you'll get a flyer if you buy a firearm
 
07:07:53.208 --> 07:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
and it'll open they'll give it to you
 
07:07:56.270 --> 07:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
and so there is Federal Regulation it
 
07:07:58.250 --> 07:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
makes you accountable if somebody who
 
07:08:00.650 --> 07:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
underage gets a hold of your gun
 
07:08:03.530 --> 07:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
um so again it's a law are we doing
 
07:08:05.090 --> 07:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
anything about it we Prosecuting anybody
 
07:08:07.150 --> 07:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
because a child get
 
07:08:09.410 --> 07:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
harmed or damage we're going to approx
 
07:08:11.150 --> 07:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
you know pass another law that we're not
 
07:08:12.650 --> 07:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
going to prosecute somebody for if
 
07:08:16.368 --> 07:08:16.378 align:start position:0%
something bad happens so I would say we
 
07:08:18.468 --> 07:08:18.478 align:start position:0%
may already have the tools to do what
 
07:08:19.670 --> 07:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is intended I don't know we need
 
07:08:23.330 --> 07:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
another law to achieve what is wanted
 
07:08:26.270 --> 07:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
here and lastly I'll just
 
07:08:29.448 --> 07:08:29.458 align:start position:0%
um State personally I think education is
 
07:08:32.208 --> 07:08:32.218 align:start position:0%
important here uh education of parents
 
07:08:35.030 --> 07:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
adults and children
 
07:08:37.548 --> 07:08:37.558 align:start position:0%
um how that happens there's a lot of
 
07:08:40.270 --> 07:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
ways to do it I know personally
 
07:08:43.310 --> 07:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
my kindergarten my son my parents Kids
 
07:08:44.868 --> 07:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
kindergarten Keisha came up to me I said
 
07:08:46.368 --> 07:08:46.378 align:start position:0%
boy you boys are so well behaved you
 
07:08:47.390 --> 07:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
know all the other kids are running
 
07:08:48.830 --> 07:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
around making things in the guns and
 
07:08:50.448 --> 07:08:50.458 align:start position:0%
shooting each other with them your kids
 
07:08:52.610 --> 07:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
don't do that and you know I taught them
 
07:08:55.070 --> 07:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
my youngest son I taught him at age five
 
07:08:57.530 --> 07:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
how to shoot under my supervision
 
07:09:01.128 --> 07:09:01.138 align:start position:0%
my next son I actually taught him at six
 
07:09:02.690 --> 07:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
because he thought he knew more than I
 
07:09:04.548 --> 07:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
did at five so we waited and said this
 
07:09:05.690 --> 07:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
is going to happen another day when he
 
07:09:08.690 --> 07:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
was six and um they have always been
 
07:09:10.368 --> 07:09:10.378 align:start position:0%
very respectful I feel safer with them
 
07:09:12.590 --> 07:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
than I do just about anybody I know who
 
07:09:15.530 --> 07:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
keeps and bears a firearm and uh so I I
 
07:09:17.810 --> 07:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
will just leave you with that but I I uh
 
07:09:19.070 --> 07:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know thank you that's the time
 
07:09:23.390 --> 07:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:29.270 --> 07:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:30.590 --> 07:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
07:09:31.968 --> 07:09:31.978 align:start position:0%
committee I'd like to share a sad story
 
07:09:33.770 --> 07:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
about a horrific act of violence where a
 
07:09:35.090 --> 07:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
safe storage techniques led to a
 
07:09:37.190 --> 07:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
fatality I'd like to share the story of
 
07:09:38.690 --> 07:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
the fate of Mrs orpington
 
07:09:41.090 --> 07:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
on a gorgeous Autumn night in New
 
07:09:42.830 --> 07:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a loud noise was heard outside
 
07:09:44.390 --> 07:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
of rural New Hampshire home while a
 
07:09:46.128 --> 07:09:46.138 align:start position:0%
family was sleeping sensing danger the
 
07:09:47.510 --> 07:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
man of the house looked outside to see
 
07:09:49.310 --> 07:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
Mrs orpington's home under Invasion
 
07:09:51.110 --> 07:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
thinking quickly the man ran to his
 
07:09:52.850 --> 07:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
office and started unlocking his rifle a
 
07:09:55.250 --> 07:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
Ruger 10 22. it was dark and he had a
 
07:09:56.570 --> 07:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
punch in the code multiple times for the
 
07:09:58.610 --> 07:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
mechanism to work correctly but finally
 
07:10:00.170 --> 07:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
he did open the safe and once he had it
 
07:10:02.030 --> 07:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
he found the rifle unloaded he searched
 
07:10:03.410 --> 07:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
around for the magazine and found it on
 
07:10:05.208 --> 07:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
the floor he loaded the rifle and headed
 
07:10:07.010 --> 07:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
outside nothing could prepare him for
 
07:10:09.048 --> 07:10:09.058 align:start position:0%
the Carnage that awaited him the once
 
07:10:10.250 --> 07:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
beautiful blonde and buff hen
 
07:10:12.110 --> 07:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
affectionately called Mrs orpington laid
 
07:10:13.250 --> 07:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
dead on the ground surrounded by
 
07:10:15.468 --> 07:10:15.478 align:start position:0%
feathers the culbert was a skunk who had
 
07:10:17.390 --> 07:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
already gone long gone
 
07:10:19.310 --> 07:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
she was the only she was only one year
 
07:10:20.628 --> 07:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
old and had the potential to lay
 
07:10:22.548 --> 07:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
hundreds of eggs before retirement but
 
07:10:24.170 --> 07:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
due to the inaccessibility of a tool
 
07:10:25.968 --> 07:10:25.978 align:start position:0%
capable of saving her life she never
 
07:10:28.250 --> 07:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
laid those eggs in the current economy
 
07:10:30.890 --> 07:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
those actions represented a 500 retail
 
07:10:30.900 --> 07:10:31.788 align:start position:0%
those actions represented a 500 retail
value

07:10:31.788 --> 07:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
value
 
07:10:33.468 --> 07:10:33.478 align:start position:0%
this bill would enable more tragic
 
07:10:35.448 --> 07:10:35.458 align:start position:0%
stories like this to occur for centuries
 
07:10:36.890 --> 07:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
those who had poultry and livestock
 
07:10:38.570 --> 07:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
stored their rifles above the door to
 
07:10:40.730 --> 07:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
their home this allowed them and their
 
07:10:42.288 --> 07:10:42.298 align:start position:0%
family the ability to handle Critters
 
07:10:43.548 --> 07:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
that would attack their homesteads
 
07:10:44.810 --> 07:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
without having to jump through hoops
 
07:10:46.968 --> 07:10:46.978 align:start position:0%
this bill would endanger farm animals by
 
07:10:48.170 --> 07:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
taking away the protections of the
 
07:10:50.810 --> 07:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
farmers Fox into their damage quick
 
07:10:53.208 --> 07:10:53.218 align:start position:0%
raccoons as well chickens even well
 
07:10:54.708 --> 07:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
guarded blocked with a rooster present
 
07:10:56.270 --> 07:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
are always at risk from Critters to
 
07:10:58.250 --> 07:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
attack swiftly and often for fun seconds
 
07:11:00.230 --> 07:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
count this bill also puts unreasonable
 
07:11:02.150 --> 07:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
age restrictions in Annie Oakley was
 
07:11:03.708 --> 07:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
eight when she began to hunt to feed her
 
07:11:05.510 --> 07:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
family she was winning competitions at
 
07:11:07.610 --> 07:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
15. in New Hampshire if this bill is
 
07:11:09.468 --> 07:11:09.478 align:start position:0%
signed her Widow mother would be guilty
 
07:11:11.690 --> 07:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
of a misdemeanor I I ask you to please
 
07:11:13.868 --> 07:11:13.878 align:start position:0%
vote itl on this Bill thank you
 
07:11:17.330 --> 07:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:11:23.150 --> 07:11:23.160 align:start position:0%

thank you for letting me testify
 
07:11:28.010 --> 07:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues I have with the
 
07:11:30.708 --> 07:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
quick analysis here where it says there
 
07:11:31.910 --> 07:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
has to be locking safety device a
 
07:11:33.830 --> 07:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
company all private in commercial
 
07:11:36.830 --> 07:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
Firearms this build requires infringing
 
07:11:38.390 --> 07:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
on the right to privacy as outlined in
 
07:11:41.930 --> 07:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights and therefore I
 
07:11:43.788 --> 07:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
should just be I tell this Bill thank
 
07:11:43.798 --> 07:11:45.650 align:start position:0%
should just be I tell this Bill thank
you

07:11:45.650 --> 07:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:11:48.350 --> 07:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:11:55.070 --> 07:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:55.080 --> 07:11:56.868 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:11:56.868 --> 07:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:11:59.930 --> 07:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
early evening to everyone
 
07:12:02.448 --> 07:12:02.458 align:start position:0%
um johannan Gunners New Hampshire uh
 
07:12:05.690 --> 07:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
we're in opposition to HB 351
 
07:12:08.030 --> 07:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
um there are several reasons obviously
 
07:12:11.868 --> 07:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
one I mean you're requiring a citizen to
 
07:12:13.788 --> 07:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
purchase something commercially so we've
 
07:12:15.110 --> 07:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
talked about commercial sales and all
 
07:12:16.968 --> 07:12:16.978 align:start position:0%
this stuff I don't know of any laws that
 
07:12:18.468 --> 07:12:18.478 align:start position:0%
mandate you buy something well there's
 
07:12:20.150 --> 07:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
one but we won't get into that here uh
 
07:12:21.530 --> 07:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's a federal thing
 
07:12:23.330 --> 07:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
um so as far from besides health
 
07:12:25.070 --> 07:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
insurance you have this you're going to
 
07:12:27.770 --> 07:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
mandate that they buy a lock I've never
 
07:12:29.208 --> 07:12:29.218 align:start position:0%
bought a firearm from a dealer that
 
07:12:30.410 --> 07:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
didn't have one available or didn't have
 
07:12:32.330 --> 07:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
a big bag or a bucket or a bin somewhere
 
07:12:34.010 --> 07:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
they said take one
 
07:12:35.570 --> 07:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
um I've rarely seen a gun show without
 
07:12:38.330 --> 07:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
them around or everywhere uh Private
 
07:12:40.010 --> 07:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
Sales like you heard earlier you can't
 
07:12:41.868 --> 07:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
really dictate what's happening at a
 
07:12:43.730 --> 07:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
private sale you don't know if they have
 
07:12:44.990 --> 07:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
it you'd think that people would have it
 
07:12:46.910 --> 07:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing is you can't mandate
 
07:12:49.368 --> 07:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
having them locked up either
 
07:12:51.350 --> 07:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
um they've done they did a study uh last
 
07:12:54.048 --> 07:12:54.058 align:start position:0%
year that talked about interviewed 55
 
07:12:55.788 --> 07:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
000 Firearms owners and states that had
 
07:12:57.468 --> 07:12:57.478 align:start position:0%
child access laws and we are one of
 
07:12:59.090 --> 07:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
those States we have child access laws
 
07:12:59.100 --> 07:13:00.048 align:start position:0%
those States we have child access laws
currently

07:13:00.048 --> 07:13:00.058 align:start position:0%
currently
 
07:13:02.330 --> 07:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
and states that didn't have them and
 
07:13:03.830 --> 07:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
most people didn't even know the
 
07:13:05.810 --> 07:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
difference if you know they didn't it
 
07:13:07.850 --> 07:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
didn't affect greatly whether they
 
07:13:10.310 --> 07:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
locked them or not uh so as far as
 
07:13:12.048 --> 07:13:12.058 align:start position:0%
mandatory locking them they're not even
 
07:13:13.310 --> 07:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
doing that when it's required by law
 
07:13:16.368 --> 07:13:16.378 align:start position:0%
sometimes or even know what the law was
 
07:13:16.378 --> 07:13:17.048 align:start position:0%
sometimes or even know what the law was
um

07:13:17.048 --> 07:13:17.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:19.730 --> 07:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
real quick um
 
07:13:21.350 --> 07:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know this takes a violation and
 
07:13:23.448 --> 07:13:23.458 align:start position:0%
makes it a misdemeanor uh we already
 
07:13:26.448 --> 07:13:26.458 align:start position:0%
have a lot of exceptions for uh safety
 
07:13:29.150 --> 07:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh for firearm storage you know you
 
07:13:31.490 --> 07:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
heard hunter safety course uh parental
 
07:13:33.170 --> 07:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
permission is one thing if you say I'm
 
07:13:35.090 --> 07:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
giving my child permission to have
 
07:13:37.730 --> 07:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
access that can be an exception to the
 
07:13:39.530 --> 07:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
law currently so what's going to happen
 
07:13:40.788 --> 07:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
they're going to get in trouble for this
 
07:13:41.990 --> 07:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
and they're going to say you know the
 
07:13:43.190 --> 07:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
kid might have had permission now the
 
07:13:44.510 --> 07:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
parent's going to go to jail possibly
 
07:13:45.170 --> 07:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
and they're going to say well I didn't
 
07:13:46.730 --> 07:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
give that kid permission they're not
 
07:13:48.110 --> 07:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
going to lock up the kid but hey you
 
07:13:49.490 --> 07:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a bad position to put
 
07:13:52.330 --> 07:13:52.340 align:start position:0%
people in and they added also lastly
 
07:13:55.250 --> 07:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
Firearms is exhibited or displayed to
 
07:13:57.530 --> 07:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
others that's not recklessly threatening
 
07:13:58.910 --> 07:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's not using the commission of a
 
07:14:00.110 --> 07:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or not an English
 
07:14:02.030 --> 07:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
negligently or recklessly discharging it
 
07:14:03.830 --> 07:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's just showing it to someone now I
 
07:14:04.968 --> 07:14:04.978 align:start position:0%
don't want to encourage that I don't
 
07:14:06.230 --> 07:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea I think it's bad
 
07:14:08.868 --> 07:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
parenting it's a bad kid in some senses
 
07:14:11.330 --> 07:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
if they don't know better but uh just
 
07:14:12.530 --> 07:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
the mirror exhibiting of something
 
07:14:13.968 --> 07:14:13.978 align:start position:0%
should not rise to the level of a crime
 
07:14:15.230 --> 07:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
for the parent
 
07:14:17.090 --> 07:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh and what if the parent of the other
 
07:14:19.010 --> 07:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
child doesn't like guns in general you
 
07:14:20.570 --> 07:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
know if I know that and this is a law
 
07:14:22.430 --> 07:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to let those kids come to
 
07:14:24.170 --> 07:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
my house just they're locked up and
 
07:14:25.310 --> 07:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
they're safe but I don't want to have
 
07:14:26.510 --> 07:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
the risk of them even making that
 
07:14:26.520 --> 07:14:29.090 align:start position:0%
the risk of them even making that
accusation

07:14:29.090 --> 07:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:31.128 --> 07:14:31.138 align:start position:0%
um two time yep thank you that's good
 
07:14:34.670 --> 07:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:36.948 --> 07:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:14:36.958 --> 07:14:37.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
um

07:14:37.910 --> 07:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:44.350 --> 07:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:47.628 --> 07:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Linda Haskins Rockingham
 
07:14:47.638 --> 07:14:48.730 align:start position:0%

07:14:51.230 --> 07:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
representing Exeter
 
07:14:54.830 --> 07:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your forbearance
 
07:14:58.368 --> 07:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
and kind attention this afternoon
 
07:15:01.190 --> 07:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired school counselor and Dr
 
07:15:03.530 --> 07:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
horn has said it better than I
 
07:15:06.830 --> 07:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
Gunn rights Advocates always talk about
 
07:15:08.690 --> 07:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
07:15:11.690 --> 07:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's a problem of Mental Health
 
07:15:14.628 --> 07:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
we are here today
 
07:15:18.110 --> 07:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
with the opportunity to do something
 
07:15:20.830 --> 07:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's not everything but it's something
 
07:15:24.890 --> 07:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
and I think with all the bipartisan talk
 
07:15:27.468 --> 07:15:27.478 align:start position:0%
I hear in the hall
 
07:15:30.890 --> 07:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
this is one bill that we could agree on
 
07:15:34.670 --> 07:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's not about taking anybody's guns
 
07:15:38.390 --> 07:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
away it's about preserving life it's
 
07:15:41.390 --> 07:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
about giving us an opportunity to
 
07:15:44.330 --> 07:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
intervene when there are only very good
 
07:15:47.150 --> 07:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
reasons and let's have some confidence
 
07:15:50.090 --> 07:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
in the judges in our court system to be
 
07:15:52.968 --> 07:15:52.978 align:start position:0%
able to distinguish when it is a
 
07:15:55.968 --> 07:15:55.978 align:start position:0%
critical need it's not willy-nilly
 
07:15:57.830 --> 07:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're not going to go along with a
 
07:16:00.530 --> 07:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
protective order I am the proud daughter
 
07:16:03.530 --> 07:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
of a dad who spent my entire childhood
 
07:16:07.190 --> 07:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement the only time I ever
 
07:16:10.430 --> 07:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
saw his gun was when he was in uniform I
 
07:16:12.230 --> 07:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
have no idea where he kept it in the
 
07:16:16.788 --> 07:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
house but this is not 1980. this is 2023
 
07:16:19.250 --> 07:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
and we have to acknowledge there are
 
07:16:22.190 --> 07:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
many more guns and parents are very busy
 
07:16:24.350 --> 07:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
and even the most well-intentioned
 
07:16:26.930 --> 07:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
parent could neglect
 
07:16:29.868 --> 07:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
to put the gun safely where it belongs
 
07:16:33.410 --> 07:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
we've got to do this for our kids and as
 
07:16:36.110 --> 07:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
I say this is an opportunity for us to
 
07:16:39.350 --> 07:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
have a bipartisan agreement to help save
 
07:16:41.990 --> 07:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
our kids thank you
 
07:16:45.468 --> 07:16:45.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:57.650 --> 07:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:01.910 --> 07:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
Jay simpkin born once going twice
 
07:17:28.730 --> 07:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:31.310 --> 07:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
I will ask that you it all the spill
 
07:17:31.320 --> 07:17:32.628 align:start position:0%
I will ask that you it all the spill
please

07:17:32.628 --> 07:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
please
 
07:17:35.030 --> 07:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
I will go through again the bad parts
 
07:17:37.250 --> 07:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
quickly 351.
 
07:17:39.468 --> 07:17:39.478 align:start position:0%
we start at the beginning I think this
 
07:17:41.628 --> 07:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
is a cute little back door trick nice
 
07:17:44.510 --> 07:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
try to get us to redefine again
 
07:17:47.030 --> 07:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
commercial sales of firearms and get it
 
07:17:49.310 --> 07:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
through the back door so that all
 
07:17:51.170 --> 07:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
firearms get checked through the system
 
07:17:53.810 --> 07:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
and personal sales are not a lot
 
07:17:56.170 --> 07:17:56.180 align:start position:0%
because if you look at the first lines
 
07:18:02.510 --> 07:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
in 1A it's on page 1 8 9 and 10.
 
07:18:06.110 --> 07:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
public sale or exchange including but
 
07:18:08.628 --> 07:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
not limited to and then when you look at
 
07:18:11.990 --> 07:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
the next page which is page two
 
07:18:14.448 --> 07:18:14.458 align:start position:0%
um lines three seller means a person
 
07:18:16.910 --> 07:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
offering a firearm for commercial sale
 
07:18:19.310 --> 07:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
private sale or barter we're getting
 
07:18:21.948 --> 07:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
back to the fact that they want all guns
 
07:18:23.690 --> 07:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
to be checked through the system that no
 
07:18:25.548 --> 07:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
Private Sales will be allowed that's
 
07:18:28.010 --> 07:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
really what this is coming down to
 
07:18:29.930 --> 07:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
and second
 
07:18:32.390 --> 07:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
when someone says oh they can access the
 
07:18:33.830 --> 07:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
firearm in five minutes that's about
 
07:18:35.690 --> 07:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
four and a half minutes too late
 
07:18:39.530 --> 07:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
in most instances not quick enough
 
07:18:43.788 --> 07:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
the next thing that we talk about is
 
07:18:43.798 --> 07:18:45.250 align:start position:0%
the next thing that we talk about is
specifically

07:18:45.250 --> 07:18:45.260 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
07:18:52.128 --> 07:18:52.138 align:start position:0%
on page two lines 29 30 31 32.
 
07:18:55.490 --> 07:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay so without the supervision or
 
07:18:58.730 --> 07:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
permission of the child's parent
 
07:19:00.590 --> 07:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
so if the child's parents are
 
07:19:02.930 --> 07:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
supervising what does that means I mean
 
07:19:04.490 --> 07:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
they're out at the pool watching what
 
07:19:06.770 --> 07:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
what does supervision mean but when it
 
07:19:08.330 --> 07:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
comes to parent
 
07:19:11.048 --> 07:19:11.058 align:start position:0%
I'm the step parent is that good enough
 
07:19:14.150 --> 07:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'm the parent without custody is that
 
07:19:16.310 --> 07:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
good enough does it have to be written
 
07:19:18.530 --> 07:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
is that good enough what if Mom and
 
07:19:20.810 --> 07:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
father differ and they're divorced is
 
07:19:22.250 --> 07:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
that good enough
 
07:19:24.830 --> 07:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
these type of things really become to
 
07:19:24.840 --> 07:19:26.410 align:start position:0%
these type of things really become to
matter

07:19:26.410 --> 07:19:26.420 align:start position:0%
matter
 
07:19:29.570 --> 07:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
next you're looking about gross
 
07:19:32.208 --> 07:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
negligence that necessarily has it on
 
07:19:36.250 --> 07:19:36.260 align:start position:0%
page three lines four
 
07:19:38.990 --> 07:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
going back to the fact that you're
 
07:19:41.628 --> 07:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
basically saying the kid can't defend
 
07:19:43.070 --> 07:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
themselves in the house we've had
 
07:19:44.270 --> 07:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
six-year-olds seven-year-olds
 
07:19:46.070 --> 07:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
eight-year-olds camping in Firearms
 
07:19:48.650 --> 07:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
defend their family defend their
 
07:19:50.810 --> 07:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
siblings defend their mother and save
 
07:19:53.208 --> 07:19:53.218 align:start position:0%
lives so you're gonna punish these
 
07:19:53.218 --> 07:19:54.048 align:start position:0%
lives so you're gonna punish these
people

07:19:54.048 --> 07:19:54.058 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:19:56.810 --> 07:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's just plain old crazy
 
07:19:59.448 --> 07:19:59.458 align:start position:0%
but the other thing when we look at this
 
07:20:02.270 --> 07:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
and we have to look at this as someone
 
07:20:04.788 --> 07:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
said we're giving your time oh one line
 
07:20:07.548 --> 07:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
one line we're gonna trust our judges
 
07:20:10.070 --> 07:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're unelected judges you can't an
 
07:20:11.628 --> 07:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
elect them they're appointed judges
 
07:20:13.910 --> 07:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's a big deal
 
07:20:16.610 --> 07:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:20:19.010 --> 07:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
um last try for JE simpkin have you
 
07:20:26.170 --> 07:20:26.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:28.490 --> 07:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm closing the public
 
07:20:31.128 --> 07:20:31.138 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 351 and I'm
 
07:20:33.070 --> 07:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
opening to public hearing on House Bill
 
07:20:36.890 --> 07:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
444 and I recognize representative Muse
 
07:20:39.830 --> 07:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
to introduce his bill excuse me that
 
07:20:41.930 --> 07:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
looks like I showed up in person and I
 
07:20:43.730 --> 07:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
gratefully thank representative Muse for
 
07:20:45.350 --> 07:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
filling in for me I we have a long
 
07:20:47.330 --> 07:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
executive session to Judiciary and I'm
 
07:20:50.270 --> 07:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
here to get back to that we've got Lord
 
07:20:51.830 --> 07:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington will be introducing as well
 
07:20:55.610 --> 07:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
what and uh although he certainly would
 
07:20:57.708 --> 07:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
have been prepared done a great job of
 
07:20:59.030 --> 07:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
introducing it and probably would have
 
07:21:00.948 --> 07:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer any questions
 
07:21:00.958 --> 07:21:01.968 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer any questions
um

07:21:01.968 --> 07:21:01.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:04.788 --> 07:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping this issue has come up
 
07:21:07.128 --> 07:21:07.138 align:start position:0%
before uh most recently in 2022
 
07:21:09.048 --> 07:21:09.058 align:start position:0%
representative Muse actually sponsored
 
07:21:11.690 --> 07:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
1096 which is a very good bill that fell
 
07:21:13.548 --> 07:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
a little short I think
 
07:21:15.410 --> 07:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
this one is uh
 
07:21:17.090 --> 07:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
this one is similar I think it's a
 
07:21:19.368 --> 07:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
little bit simpler uh for sure it
 
07:21:21.410 --> 07:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
creates fewer problems for the uh for
 
07:21:23.628 --> 07:21:23.638 align:start position:0%
the gun owners because I know there's
 
07:21:25.368 --> 07:21:25.378 align:start position:0%
always the issue of keeping track of
 
07:21:27.650 --> 07:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
where your gun is welcome and where it
 
07:21:29.150 --> 07:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
isn't where you can carry it where you
 
07:21:30.770 --> 07:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
can't and I think just makes it easier
 
07:21:33.708 --> 07:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
it bans guns and other deadly weapons
 
07:21:36.048 --> 07:21:36.058 align:start position:0%
with a hundred feet of the polling place
 
07:21:38.030 --> 07:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
and we're just I'm just using the
 
07:21:39.530 --> 07:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
commonly understood definition of
 
07:21:41.810 --> 07:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
polling place which is uh
 
07:21:44.030 --> 07:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
well understood appears in many other
 
07:21:46.548 --> 07:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
places in both state and federal law and
 
07:21:49.610 --> 07:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
and rules too and it's the place where
 
07:21:52.250 --> 07:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
the election activities are taking place
 
07:21:54.650 --> 07:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
only places are very clearly marked it's
 
07:21:56.270 --> 07:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
very specific requirements for how to
 
07:21:58.730 --> 07:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
mark them in addition there's signs
 
07:22:00.708 --> 07:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
marking the 100 foot radius around the
 
07:22:00.718 --> 07:22:02.150 align:start position:0%
marking the 100 foot radius around the
entrance

07:22:02.150 --> 07:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
entrance
 
07:22:04.010 --> 07:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
even if the signs are missing I think
 
07:22:06.288 --> 07:22:06.298 align:start position:0%
most people maybe not everyone but most
 
07:22:07.788 --> 07:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
of us can recently have a pretty good
 
07:22:09.890 --> 07:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
idea like how long a distance 100 feet
 
07:22:09.900 --> 07:22:10.968 align:start position:0%
idea like how long a distance 100 feet
is

07:22:10.968 --> 07:22:10.978 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:22:13.190 --> 07:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
and unless that turned out is extremely
 
07:22:14.690 --> 07:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
low or it's just not a very
 
07:22:16.010 --> 07:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
controversial issue at the election
 
07:22:18.048 --> 07:22:18.058 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a few individuals
 
07:22:20.750 --> 07:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
holding political signs 101 feet from
 
07:22:23.690 --> 07:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
the entrance and I'll say two here I
 
07:22:25.368 --> 07:22:25.378 align:start position:0%
have enough confidence in our law
 
07:22:26.990 --> 07:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement our Judiciary here that
 
07:22:28.368 --> 07:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be like swooping in
 
07:22:30.468 --> 07:22:30.478 align:start position:0%
and nabbing somebody who accidentally
 
07:22:32.690 --> 07:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
carries his gun you know 90 finds
 
07:22:34.670 --> 07:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
himself 99 feet from the entrance of the
 
07:22:36.170 --> 07:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
high school or wherever else
 
07:22:38.270 --> 07:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
whatever place where the polls are pink
 
07:22:40.430 --> 07:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
place and if you're worried about you
 
07:22:42.410 --> 07:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
know running into bad guys Bears
 
07:22:44.868 --> 07:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
whatever while you're trying to vote
 
07:22:46.730 --> 07:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
she takes solace in the fact that
 
07:22:48.650 --> 07:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
there's always law enforcement officers
 
07:22:51.190 --> 07:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
on duty at the polling place
 
07:22:53.510 --> 07:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
is a pretty large one usually have about
 
07:22:56.750 --> 07:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
at least five or six armed officers uh
 
07:22:58.490 --> 07:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
in the polling place some even out in
 
07:23:00.110 --> 07:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
the parking lot mostly directing traffic
 
07:23:00.120 --> 07:23:01.128 align:start position:0%
the parking lot mostly directing traffic
but

07:23:01.128 --> 07:23:01.138 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:23:02.990 --> 07:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
if there's an attack on the polling
 
07:23:04.490 --> 07:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
place they would be our first line of
 
07:23:06.948 --> 07:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
defense and it actually originally when
 
07:23:08.570 --> 07:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
I put in the LSR I was originally
 
07:23:11.390 --> 07:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
playing just put in open carry but I
 
07:23:13.010 --> 07:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
decided to go ahead and just make it all
 
07:23:15.650 --> 07:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
weapons so simpler that's practical
 
07:23:16.850 --> 07:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
matter if you're
 
07:23:18.890 --> 07:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
if you're concealing your weapon they're
 
07:23:20.030 --> 07:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
not going to know you're carrying a
 
07:23:22.010 --> 07:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
concealed weapon anyway so the issue is
 
07:23:24.708 --> 07:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
not going to come up and I've got a
 
07:23:27.230 --> 07:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
a specific carve out for unloaded
 
07:23:29.448 --> 07:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
weapons secured in Motor Vehicles even
 
07:23:31.010 --> 07:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
if your parking place is less than 100
 
07:23:33.788 --> 07:23:33.798 align:start position:0%
feet from the door and also
 
07:23:36.288 --> 07:23:36.298 align:start position:0%
also for law enforcement officers not
 
07:23:37.850 --> 07:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
those who are not just those who are
 
07:23:39.708 --> 07:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
specifically in duty at duty at the
 
07:23:41.690 --> 07:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
plumbing place but also those
 
07:23:44.628 --> 07:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
who are you know voting on their way to
 
07:23:45.890 --> 07:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
work and the way to back work and
 
07:23:48.048 --> 07:23:48.058 align:start position:0%
happened to be wearing the uniform of
 
07:23:49.968 --> 07:23:49.978 align:start position:0%
which the gun is an integral part I know
 
07:23:52.430 --> 07:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
I have a neighbor who's a member lives
 
07:23:54.110 --> 07:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
in Durham but she's a member of a force
 
07:23:55.730 --> 07:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
in another town I think it's Northampton
 
07:23:58.070 --> 07:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
she showed up on the last election day
 
07:24:00.288 --> 07:24:00.298 align:start position:0%
with her Northampton Police Department
 
07:24:02.330 --> 07:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
uniform including her service revolver
 
07:24:04.610 --> 07:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
and I had no problem with that
 
07:24:06.948 --> 07:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
and uh also the
 
07:24:09.230 --> 07:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
the penalty is a class A misdemeanor
 
07:24:11.150 --> 07:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
which usually it could theoretically
 
07:24:13.010 --> 07:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
result in a year in jail but once again
 
07:24:14.390 --> 07:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
I have confidence in our criminal
 
07:24:16.548 --> 07:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
Judiciary or they're not going around
 
07:24:17.810 --> 07:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
I don't think they're going around
 
07:24:20.150 --> 07:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting uh someone who somehow
 
07:24:21.948 --> 07:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
accidentally manages to carry the gun
 
07:24:23.810 --> 07:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
into the polling place and in most cases
 
07:24:25.968 --> 07:24:25.978 align:start position:0%
a good moderator would probably just
 
07:24:27.770 --> 07:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
tell them to lock it up in their car and
 
07:24:30.170 --> 07:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
go back and vote so I heard she
 
07:24:32.090 --> 07:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
committee to ought to pass
 
07:24:33.770 --> 07:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
and pretty here to get back to my own
 
07:24:35.510 --> 07:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
executive session but I suppose I have
 
07:24:35.520 --> 07:24:36.410 align:start position:0%
executive session but I suppose I have
to

07:24:36.410 --> 07:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:24:38.390 --> 07:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
open it up for any questions bear in
 
07:24:41.150 --> 07:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
mind uh president Muse was definitely
 
07:24:42.410 --> 07:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
probably would have done a better job of
 
07:24:43.968 --> 07:24:43.978 align:start position:0%
testifying to me but I guess he'll have
 
07:24:46.128 --> 07:24:46.138 align:start position:0%
to say his observations for the exact
 
07:24:47.510 --> 07:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
session unless you want to recognize
 
07:24:50.390 --> 07:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
them as a speaker but thank you
 
07:24:53.810 --> 07:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:24:56.090 --> 07:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
07:25:03.670 --> 07:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:06.410 --> 07:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and find committee
 
07:25:09.410 --> 07:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
members I do oppose this bill I have
 
07:25:12.170 --> 07:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
fought this bill many times and luckily
 
07:25:13.968 --> 07:25:13.978 align:start position:0%
been successful at killing it each time
 
07:25:17.270 --> 07:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:21.948 --> 07:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
open carry a lot I like open carrying
 
07:25:25.128 --> 07:25:25.138 align:start position:0%
today I'm concealed carrying but what I
 
07:25:27.288 --> 07:25:27.298 align:start position:0%
believe is uh I have the right to do
 
07:25:29.510 --> 07:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
either so in Goffstown when I go to Home
 
07:25:32.090 --> 07:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
Depot Hannaford's anywhere as I go I'm
 
07:25:35.810 --> 07:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
carrying my nine millimeter on my head
 
07:25:35.820 --> 07:25:36.650 align:start position:0%
carrying my nine millimeter on my head
um

07:25:36.650 --> 07:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:39.590 --> 07:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
Bartlett School is within 100 feet of
 
07:25:41.390 --> 07:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
the polling place you know where we
 
07:25:44.628 --> 07:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
stand with our political signs so that
 
07:25:44.638 --> 07:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
stand with our political signs so that
means

07:25:45.830 --> 07:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
means
 
07:25:47.690 --> 07:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be able to stand there
 
07:25:50.750 --> 07:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
and also this disenfranchises me from
 
07:25:54.410 --> 07:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
voting because I feel I have a right a
 
07:25:56.330 --> 07:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to bring my gun to
 
07:25:58.190 --> 07:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
the poll in place to make sure I'm
 
07:26:00.590 --> 07:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
protected while I'm voting
 
07:26:04.010 --> 07:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I just don't see why we need this uh
 
07:26:07.850 --> 07:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
up in where when I was a State Rep and
 
07:26:10.788 --> 07:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
at some point I will return
 
07:26:10.798 --> 07:26:11.868 align:start position:0%
at some point I will return
um

07:26:11.868 --> 07:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:14.390 --> 07:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
when up and where we're within 20 feet
 
07:26:17.930 --> 07:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
of the polling place here's the door
 
07:26:20.030 --> 07:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
here we are right outside the door
 
07:26:22.270 --> 07:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
saying hi to the voters as they come in
 
07:26:25.670 --> 07:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
and most of us are carrying so this
 
07:26:27.530 --> 07:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
isn't going to work so I hope you it
 
07:26:29.990 --> 07:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
yell it and please do the right thing to
 
07:26:32.030 --> 07:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that the people that decide to
 
07:26:34.730 --> 07:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
carry a gun constitutionally they have a
 
07:26:37.090 --> 07:26:37.100 align:start position:0%
right they can still vote or you're
 
07:26:39.288 --> 07:26:39.298 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising them and I know how one
 
07:26:41.150 --> 07:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
party does not want to disenfranchise
 
07:26:43.850 --> 07:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
anybody so I hope that you will do this
 
07:26:45.770 --> 07:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:26:48.948 --> 07:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
I give you testimony and the chair
 
07:26:57.230 --> 07:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:59.810 --> 07:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
so while we're practicing our right to
 
07:27:02.390 --> 07:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
vote this bill makes it so we aren't
 
07:27:04.310 --> 07:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to practice our fundamental
 
07:27:07.010 --> 07:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
human right to self-defense protected by
 
07:27:08.930 --> 07:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment
 
07:27:10.968 --> 07:27:10.978 align:start position:0%
again just like with the school zone
 
07:27:12.890 --> 07:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
bill this bill creates a gun-free zone
 
07:27:15.288 --> 07:27:15.298 align:start position:0%
that enables criminals to easily prey on
 
07:27:17.810 --> 07:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
victims especially women who choose to
 
07:27:19.128 --> 07:27:19.138 align:start position:0%
protect themselves and their children
 
07:27:21.650 --> 07:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
with a firearm once again this is
 
07:27:23.390 --> 07:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
legislation looking to solve a problem
 
07:27:25.730 --> 07:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist in New Hampshire
 
07:27:28.190 --> 07:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
please vote in expedient to legislate on
 
07:27:29.868 --> 07:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
HB 444
 
07:27:32.270 --> 07:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
all of these gun control bills we've
 
07:27:35.090 --> 07:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
heard today do nothing but make Granite
 
07:27:38.708 --> 07:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
standards less safe thank you
 
07:27:42.350 --> 07:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:27:56.690 --> 07:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:00.048 --> 07:28:00.058 align:start position:0%
I'd urge you to vote this itl
 
07:28:03.830 --> 07:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor didn't offer any
 
07:28:06.948 --> 07:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
problem that it's looking to solve do we
 
07:28:10.250 --> 07:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
have a problem with people carrying guns
 
07:28:13.548 --> 07:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
quietly silently not obviously when they
 
07:28:16.250 --> 07:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:18.530 --> 07:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
again solution the solution in search of
 
07:28:21.288 --> 07:28:21.298 align:start position:0%
a problem it creates a mass
 
07:28:23.090 --> 07:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment
 
07:28:26.030 --> 07:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
both you know at the state level on the
 
07:28:28.548 --> 07:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
federal level doesn't say accept at a
 
07:28:30.250 --> 07:28:30.260 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
07:28:32.868 --> 07:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
this is silly
 
07:28:34.850 --> 07:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
I can't believe that that somebody's
 
07:28:37.548 --> 07:28:37.558 align:start position:0%
suggesting we should suspend one
 
07:28:39.708 --> 07:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected right in
 
07:28:41.628 --> 07:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
order to exercise another one please
 
07:28:44.350 --> 07:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
vote this itl
 
07:28:46.788 --> 07:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and the
 
07:29:04.150 --> 07:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:08.030 --> 07:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
now it's on red red light okay
 
07:29:08.040 --> 07:29:08.930 align:start position:0%
now it's on red red light okay
um

07:29:08.930 --> 07:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:11.270 --> 07:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
again this is just a I oppose this bill
 
07:29:13.850 --> 07:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
it's uh basically just another gun-free
 
07:29:17.330 --> 07:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
zone and um which I do not agree with
 
07:29:19.910 --> 07:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I I again I have to reiterate what
 
07:29:21.350 --> 07:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
some of these other folks have said uh
 
07:29:22.968 --> 07:29:22.978 align:start position:0%
you know why is that we have a problem
 
07:29:25.430 --> 07:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
with this I don't usually if you Pat you
 
07:29:27.110 --> 07:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
want to legislate something like this is
 
07:29:28.670 --> 07:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
because you've had a problem I don't
 
07:29:30.110 --> 07:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
think I haven't heard of any problems
 
07:29:31.128 --> 07:29:31.138 align:start position:0%
with this in New Hampshire I don't
 
07:29:33.530 --> 07:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
really see it being necessary I don't
 
07:29:35.570 --> 07:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
think we're having an issue uh seemed
 
07:29:36.830 --> 07:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
kind of ridiculous to me that I can be
 
07:29:39.770 --> 07:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
101 feet outside of a polling site with
 
07:29:41.990 --> 07:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
a firearm that has a effective range
 
07:29:43.788 --> 07:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
farther than that but if I step inside
 
07:29:46.310 --> 07:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
that Circle it's a problem
 
07:29:47.930 --> 07:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
um kind of silly especially if I am
 
07:29:49.850 --> 07:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
intent on harming peaceful
 
07:29:52.310 --> 07:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
um which I'm not uh but if somebody is I
 
07:29:53.570 --> 07:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
don't really think they care about this
 
07:29:55.250 --> 07:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
gun-free zone
 
07:29:58.490 --> 07:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
um I do feel
 
07:30:00.170 --> 07:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
um what we're trying to achieve here is
 
07:30:01.968 --> 07:30:01.978 align:start position:0%
going to have the opposite effect if
 
07:30:04.010 --> 07:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
anything I think it would Empower people
 
07:30:06.288 --> 07:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
who are intent on this sort of harm uh
 
07:30:09.410 --> 07:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
simply because they know nobody in there
 
07:30:11.090 --> 07:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
is armed you know nobody in that
 
07:30:13.430 --> 07:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
circle's arm so I I can be more
 
07:30:15.110 --> 07:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
effective and do more damage and harm
 
07:30:16.968 --> 07:30:16.978 align:start position:0%
because that's what I want to do
 
07:30:19.190 --> 07:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
um so uh that said
 
07:30:20.628 --> 07:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
um you know just doesn't make sense to
 
07:30:23.448 --> 07:30:23.458 align:start position:0%
me on a basic logical level and I would
 
07:30:25.190 --> 07:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
just ask that um
 
07:30:29.208 --> 07:30:29.218 align:start position:0%
uh you pose this as well thank you
 
07:30:31.070 --> 07:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:30:31.080 --> 07:30:32.390 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
oh

07:30:32.390 --> 07:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:30:38.150 --> 07:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:40.788 --> 07:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
so thank you I recommend you I tell this
 
07:30:40.798 --> 07:30:41.868 align:start position:0%
so thank you I recommend you I tell this
bill

07:30:41.868 --> 07:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:30:44.390 --> 07:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
um every person has right to speak be
 
07:30:46.910 --> 07:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
safe while they're voting and this is an
 
07:30:49.250 --> 07:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
infringement on the right to vote
 
07:30:50.990 --> 07:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the Bill's sponsor suggested that uh
 
07:30:54.230 --> 07:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
some assumptions on behavior of Law and
 
07:30:55.968 --> 07:30:55.978 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's we can really do
 
07:30:58.368 --> 07:30:58.378 align:start position:0%
that and so it's better to err on the
 
07:31:00.170 --> 07:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
side of caution and instead of innocence
 
07:31:02.930 --> 07:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
and therefore this bill should not pass
 
07:31:06.070 --> 07:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:08.690 --> 07:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony in the
 
07:31:20.690 --> 07:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:23.930 --> 07:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
so again again it seems like
 
07:31:26.628 --> 07:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
or some people
 
07:31:29.150 --> 07:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
07:31:31.968 --> 07:31:31.978 align:start position:0%
does not allow any
 
07:31:38.090 --> 07:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
uh any restrictions on guns and the gun
 
07:31:41.690 --> 07:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
violence then in our country will just
 
07:31:44.448 --> 07:31:44.458 align:start position:0%
get greater and greater
 
07:31:48.250 --> 07:31:48.260 align:start position:0%
now this is a bill to
 
07:31:53.150 --> 07:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
make polling places less threatening for
 
07:31:56.810 --> 07:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
some people now I obviously some people
 
07:31:59.690 --> 07:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
who want to carry guns don't find that
 
07:32:02.510 --> 07:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
threatening but other people do
 
07:32:05.530 --> 07:32:05.540 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:32:08.510 --> 07:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
intimidation and threatened or actual
 
07:32:10.968 --> 07:32:10.978 align:start position:0%
violence at voting places is so
 
07:32:13.750 --> 07:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
detrimental to our democracy
 
07:32:19.368 --> 07:32:19.378 align:start position:0%
that we'd like this limited restriction
 
07:32:21.288 --> 07:32:21.298 align:start position:0%
to be in place
 
07:32:26.930 --> 07:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:30.468 --> 07:32:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:33.890 --> 07:32:33.900 align:start position:0%
the chair calls J.E simpkin in case he's
 
07:32:36.650 --> 07:32:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:41.690 --> 07:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:45.110 --> 07:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay and the chair recognizes Brian
 
07:32:45.120 --> 07:32:59.030 align:start position:0%
okay and the chair recognizes Brian
blackton

07:32:59.030 --> 07:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:59.040 --> 07:33:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:33:07.070 --> 07:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:10.190 --> 07:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
I have a license to carry concealed
 
07:33:12.948 --> 07:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
firearms I am a federal firearms
 
07:33:16.128 --> 07:33:16.138 align:start position:0%
licensee I have a constitutional right
 
07:33:19.070 --> 07:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
to carry a firearm I should not be
 
07:33:21.170 --> 07:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
threatened with incarceration for
 
07:33:24.170 --> 07:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
exercising my right to carry and don't
 
07:33:24.180 --> 07:33:25.368 align:start position:0%
exercising my right to carry and don't
forget

07:33:25.368 --> 07:33:25.378 align:start position:0%
forget
 
07:33:27.948 --> 07:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
nobody likes guns until the wolf is
 
07:33:29.690 --> 07:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
knocking on your door
 
07:33:32.030 --> 07:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:33:34.430 --> 07:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:33:37.270 --> 07:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes William Reyes
 
07:33:41.390 --> 07:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:43.910 --> 07:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
still can't read it huh
 
07:33:47.330 --> 07:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
I apologize for that thank you again
 
07:33:50.090 --> 07:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
my firearm on my side
 
07:33:53.750 --> 07:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
or or rather I am never a threat when I
 
07:33:56.930 --> 07:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
carry my firearm my firearm is not a
 
07:33:59.930 --> 07:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
threat at the polling place it's not a
 
07:34:02.090 --> 07:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
threat at the registry it's not a threat
 
07:34:04.368 --> 07:34:04.378 align:start position:0%
in a supermarket it's not a threat at
 
07:34:07.150 --> 07:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk it's not a threat
 
07:34:10.250 --> 07:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
anywhere because it's on me the one
 
07:34:12.948 --> 07:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
place I would take exception and where I
 
07:34:14.570 --> 07:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
would not take a gun
 
07:34:17.448 --> 07:34:17.458 align:start position:0%
is to leave it in my car while I go
 
07:34:20.570 --> 07:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
someplace else because now the potential
 
07:34:22.368 --> 07:34:22.378 align:start position:0%
is there for it to become a threat if
 
07:34:25.070 --> 07:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
someone steals it from my car and that's
 
07:34:28.368 --> 07:34:28.378 align:start position:0%
that's not talk I don't leave my gun in
 
07:34:30.708 --> 07:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
my car ever and yet
 
07:34:34.490 --> 07:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
this is the solution when I go to vote I
 
07:34:37.310 --> 07:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
put my gun in my car or lock it up and
 
07:34:37.320 --> 07:34:38.090 align:start position:0%
put my gun in my car or lock it up and
hold

07:34:38.090 --> 07:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
hold
 
07:34:41.810 --> 07:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
no solution thank you
 
07:34:44.330 --> 07:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and the
 
07:34:48.948 --> 07:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:51.368 --> 07:34:51.378 align:start position:0%
it's gone
 
07:34:55.190 --> 07:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:00.230 --> 07:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:02.628 --> 07:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
hi my name is ALU axelman I live in
 
07:35:05.810 --> 07:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
Hooksett with my great wife and son
 
07:35:07.670 --> 07:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
um speaking in opposition to House Bill
 
07:35:10.490 --> 07:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
444 I think it's to get a quick Swift
 
07:35:14.390 --> 07:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
itl on consent calendar hopefully
 
07:35:17.750 --> 07:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
um it's a simple bill that violates the
 
07:35:20.208 --> 07:35:20.218 align:start position:0%
natural right to own property in this
 
07:35:21.830 --> 07:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
case the property made of steel and
 
07:35:23.690 --> 07:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
polymer and it violates the natural
 
07:35:25.310 --> 07:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
right assault defense
 
07:35:27.288 --> 07:35:27.298 align:start position:0%
both those natural rights are also
 
07:35:29.810 --> 07:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
protected by the New Hampshire and U.S
 
07:35:29.820 --> 07:35:31.548 align:start position:0%
protected by the New Hampshire and U.S
constitutions

07:35:31.548 --> 07:35:31.558 align:start position:0%
constitutions
 
07:35:34.910 --> 07:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
I do not know of any place in the New
 
07:35:37.070 --> 07:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or U.S constitutions that it
 
07:35:39.910 --> 07:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
says we have a right to own firearms
 
07:35:42.350 --> 07:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
except at polling places
 
07:35:43.968 --> 07:35:43.978 align:start position:0%
there's no exception
 
07:35:46.670 --> 07:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
as I said on an earlier Bill the
 
07:35:50.030 --> 07:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
founders knew what exceptions were the
 
07:35:50.990 --> 07:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
fourth and fifth Amendments have
 
07:35:51.000 --> 07:35:52.788 align:start position:0%
fourth and fifth Amendments have
exceptions

07:35:52.788 --> 07:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
07:35:54.890 --> 07:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
um the second does not so if you want to
 
07:35:57.948 --> 07:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
amend the Second Amendment or the New
 
07:35:59.690 --> 07:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution to have some
 
07:36:01.788 --> 07:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
exceptions that's fine there's a process
 
07:36:03.350 --> 07:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the state and federally to amend
 
07:36:05.628 --> 07:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
constitutions so we can work on the
 
07:36:08.628 --> 07:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
Constitutional amendment to add you have
 
07:36:10.430 --> 07:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
a right to keep Firearms accept that
 
07:36:12.170 --> 07:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
polling places
 
07:36:15.288 --> 07:36:15.298 align:start position:0%
um or accept as deemed necessary by the
 
07:36:17.690 --> 07:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
legislature or any time anything is
 
07:36:19.490 --> 07:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
dangerous ever you know that'll be a
 
07:36:21.048 --> 07:36:21.058 align:start position:0%
broad Amendment at least then it
 
07:36:23.510 --> 07:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't violate the constitution so it
 
07:36:25.250 --> 07:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
just infringes on my natural right to be
 
07:36:27.948 --> 07:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
safe at all times including when I do my
 
07:36:30.170 --> 07:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
civic duty and vote so thank you very
 
07:36:30.180 --> 07:36:32.810 align:start position:0%
civic duty and vote so thank you very
much

07:36:32.810 --> 07:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:35.810 --> 07:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:36:44.090 --> 07:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:46.128 --> 07:36:46.138 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh Johann and Gunners of
 
07:36:47.990 --> 07:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh we stand in opposition
 
07:36:50.150 --> 07:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 444
 
07:36:53.030 --> 07:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a little peculiar I mean I
 
07:36:56.448 --> 07:36:56.458 align:start position:0%
understand some of the uh about carrying
 
07:36:58.010 --> 07:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
a loaded firearm carrying an unloaded
 
07:37:00.288 --> 07:37:00.298 align:start position:0%
pistol revolver firearm is it's still a
 
07:37:01.670 --> 07:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
firearm but it's more of a paperweight
 
07:37:03.590 --> 07:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not something that's dangerous
 
07:37:06.948 --> 07:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh whether it's concealed or not we've
 
07:37:09.010 --> 07:37:09.020 align:start position:0%
had tens of thousands of people carrying
 
07:37:11.750 --> 07:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
concealed or even open carrying firearms
 
07:37:13.910 --> 07:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
for many years in New Hampshire and I
 
07:37:15.770 --> 07:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
can't think of an incident that has
 
07:37:17.270 --> 07:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
occurred I mean there may have but I
 
07:37:19.610 --> 07:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
just don't know about it uh
 
07:37:21.230 --> 07:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
also and something that's very
 
07:37:23.930 --> 07:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
concerning is uh carrying uh you know
 
07:37:26.690 --> 07:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
within 100 feet you know I stood at the
 
07:37:28.250 --> 07:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
polls like many of you for years and
 
07:37:29.690 --> 07:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
you're about 100 feet away where I was
 
07:37:32.170 --> 07:37:32.180 align:start position:0%
they made a stand back that's where most
 
07:37:34.670 --> 07:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know conversations and political
 
07:37:36.288 --> 07:37:36.298 align:start position:0%
dialogue would occur there's very little
 
07:37:38.150 --> 07:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
happening when people go inside so it's
 
07:37:40.310 --> 07:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
almost an arbitrary number and it's not
 
07:37:41.810 --> 07:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
like a bullet can't go 100 feet so I
 
07:37:43.730 --> 07:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
don't know why 100 feet was picked if
 
07:37:44.990 --> 07:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
someone has the intent to hurt someone
 
07:37:48.048 --> 07:37:48.058 align:start position:0%
that's not gonna really do anything
 
07:37:48.058 --> 07:37:48.830 align:start position:0%
that's not gonna really do anything
um

07:37:48.830 --> 07:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:37:52.128 --> 07:37:52.138 align:start position:0%
and the most dangerous thing is you're
 
07:37:54.110 --> 07:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to unload a firearm in your car
 
07:37:55.610 --> 07:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
in the parking lot of a polling place
 
07:37:57.708 --> 07:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
and people that are not very familiar
 
07:37:59.930 --> 07:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
with Firearms should know that that is
 
07:38:02.208 --> 07:38:02.218 align:start position:0%
one of the most dangerous times to
 
07:38:04.190 --> 07:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
handle to have a firearm carrying it on
 
07:38:05.750 --> 07:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
your hip or even in your safe or on your
 
07:38:07.850 --> 07:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
shelf you know if that's my gun I can
 
07:38:08.930 --> 07:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
leave it there all day it's not going to
 
07:38:10.548 --> 07:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
do anything I pick it up and I start
 
07:38:12.890 --> 07:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
messing with it in a parking lot in a
 
07:38:14.330 --> 07:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
cramped space I'm wearing a winter coat
 
07:38:16.730 --> 07:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
because it's November election time it's
 
07:38:18.288 --> 07:38:18.298 align:start position:0%
more dangerous I don't want to have to
 
07:38:19.850 --> 07:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
do that I buy a little firearm it's
 
07:38:21.708 --> 07:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
usually at a range or at a safe place in
 
07:38:23.090 --> 07:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
my home that I have a bulletproof
 
07:38:24.650 --> 07:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
backstop for I don't want to do that in
 
07:38:25.850 --> 07:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
a parking lot
 
07:38:27.650 --> 07:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
and that's what would be required for
 
07:38:29.330 --> 07:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
people that normally carry on a daily
 
07:38:31.010 --> 07:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
basis for personal protection and safety
 
07:38:32.690 --> 07:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
and if they go to vote that's something
 
07:38:34.310 --> 07:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to subject not just them to
 
07:38:35.810 --> 07:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
but the other people in that parking lot
 
07:38:37.548 --> 07:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
so this bill is actually more dangerous
 
07:38:39.948 --> 07:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
than it first appears on at first look
 
07:38:42.530 --> 07:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
so I'd ask you to please uh not pass
 
07:38:43.968 --> 07:38:43.978 align:start position:0%
this you know we don't want to make a
 
07:38:45.590 --> 07:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
crime and potentially put someone in
 
07:38:48.110 --> 07:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
jail for just under a year for the mere
 
07:38:50.090 --> 07:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
fact that They Carried something that
 
07:38:52.968 --> 07:38:52.978 align:start position:0%
was okay here at 101 feet and 100 feet
 
07:38:54.590 --> 07:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
now they have to go to jail for almost a
 
07:38:56.030 --> 07:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
year that's the difference we're talking
 
07:38:58.490 --> 07:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
about and that makes no sense
 
07:39:00.530 --> 07:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh you have to take any questions but I
 
07:39:02.330 --> 07:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
see your faces so
 
07:39:03.830 --> 07:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:39:06.288 --> 07:39:06.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh the
 
07:39:10.090 --> 07:39:10.100 align:start position:0%
chair calls Joshua L Barry
 
07:39:15.288 --> 07:39:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:18.110 --> 07:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Joshua it's close
 
07:39:21.350 --> 07:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
enough I reside in Manchester and I am
 
07:39:24.170 --> 07:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to this bill
 
07:39:26.390 --> 07:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
I wanted to note I believe this is
 
07:39:28.730 --> 07:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
already a non-issue at the most recent
 
07:39:31.310 --> 07:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
state election that I voted in I saw
 
07:39:34.128 --> 07:39:34.138 align:start position:0%
plenty of people open caring and most
 
07:39:38.448 --> 07:39:38.458 align:start position:0%
likely concealing Firearms at schools to
 
07:39:41.750 --> 07:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
restrict this in any capacity I think as
 
07:39:44.090 --> 07:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
ALU had mentioned is a violation of
 
07:39:47.150 --> 07:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
natural rights and constitutional rights
 
07:39:49.910 --> 07:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
so furthermore I personally would feel
 
07:39:52.850 --> 07:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
extremely unsafe if I'm singled out
 
07:39:56.090 --> 07:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
amongst my peers in any venue regardless
 
07:39:58.610 --> 07:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
of whether it's a school or not if it's
 
07:40:00.830 --> 07:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
known that I'm not caring or legally
 
07:40:03.590 --> 07:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
carrying a firearm I feel like a Sitting
 
07:40:06.590 --> 07:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
Duck so I potentially see this bill as
 
07:40:09.708 --> 07:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
only violating rights and by letting my
 
07:40:12.610 --> 07:40:12.620 align:start position:0%
potential safety if the fear is security
 
07:40:15.110 --> 07:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know you can increase the security
 
07:40:17.390 --> 07:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
add more cops whatever you need to do
 
07:40:21.730 --> 07:40:21.740 align:start position:0%
but don't violate my rights thank you
 
07:40:24.230 --> 07:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:40:46.330 --> 07:40:46.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:49.730 --> 07:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
I am exhibit one of why we need Firearms
 
07:40:52.190 --> 07:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
at polling places and and everywhere I
 
07:40:54.850 --> 07:40:54.860 align:start position:0%
go I ask that you itl this bill
 
07:40:57.110 --> 07:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm not the spry young
 
07:40:58.910 --> 07:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
woman that ran distance that I used to
 
07:41:01.310 --> 07:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
be some days I hobble around pretty darn
 
07:41:02.990 --> 07:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
bad with a crutch
 
07:41:06.468 --> 07:41:06.478 align:start position:0%
I gotta tell you I don't stand a chance
 
07:41:09.048 --> 07:41:09.058 align:start position:0%
against some of the larger boys and more
 
07:41:10.310 --> 07:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
agile people
 
07:41:12.048 --> 07:41:12.058 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of problems with this
 
07:41:14.868 --> 07:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
bill that I find offensive
 
07:41:18.590 --> 07:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
number one and line 11 law enforcement
 
07:41:20.750 --> 07:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
individuals in uniform are exempt from
 
07:41:20.760 --> 07:41:21.948 align:start position:0%
individuals in uniform are exempt from
it

07:41:21.948 --> 07:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:41:24.530 --> 07:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's not fair their life is worth no
 
07:41:26.448 --> 07:41:26.458 align:start position:0%
more than mine is
 
07:41:28.670 --> 07:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
and it isn't like ones that are working
 
07:41:30.410 --> 07:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
though we're talking people they could
 
07:41:31.968 --> 07:41:31.978 align:start position:0%
leave their gun in the car just like the
 
07:41:33.530 --> 07:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
rest of us do
 
07:41:35.810 --> 07:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say coming and going to work
 
07:41:37.250 --> 07:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say any of those things
 
07:41:39.230 --> 07:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
they're just treated special
 
07:41:41.510 --> 07:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
but the next issue which I think is
 
07:41:44.448 --> 07:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
larger is those people talk about what
 
07:41:46.368 --> 07:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
makes them feel uncomfortable
 
07:41:48.230 --> 07:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
there are people who bikers make them
 
07:41:50.390 --> 07:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable young kids wearing
 
07:41:52.430 --> 07:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
dreads make them feel uncondual kid
 
07:41:54.048 --> 07:41:54.058 align:start position:0%
throwing gang signs make them feel
 
07:41:56.990 --> 07:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable where do we stop
 
07:41:59.510 --> 07:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
the bottom line here is there's no
 
07:42:01.730 --> 07:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
proven issues that we've heard about
 
07:42:04.190 --> 07:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
and you are asking people to give up a
 
07:42:06.048 --> 07:42:06.058 align:start position:0%
constitutional right that is clear on
 
07:42:08.330 --> 07:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
its face in order to exercise the right
 
07:42:10.010 --> 07:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
to vote which is something that people
 
07:42:12.070 --> 07:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
in this country have spilled blood over
 
07:42:14.570 --> 07:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
they're both important rights people
 
07:42:16.610 --> 07:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to choose and I'd ask you
 
07:42:19.190 --> 07:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
I tell it please
 
07:42:26.868 --> 07:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:31.010 --> 07:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:32.208 --> 07:42:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
07:42:33.770 --> 07:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
committee I'll make it very quick I
 
07:42:35.930 --> 07:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
stand outside of polling places quite a
 
07:42:37.730 --> 07:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
bit I think we all have done that before
 
07:42:40.430 --> 07:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I really don't want to get shot and
 
07:42:42.650 --> 07:42:42.660 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair members of the
 
07:43:11.208 --> 07:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tom minion I
 
07:43:13.310 --> 07:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro One Pelham I'm here
 
07:43:15.530 --> 07:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
to introduce HP 474 relative to
 
07:43:17.390 --> 07:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal firearms laws and
 
07:43:19.250 --> 07:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
establishment of penalties
 
07:43:22.368 --> 07:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
last year we had a fantastic build HB
 
07:43:26.510 --> 07:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
1178 courtesy of our John Burt uh it
 
07:43:27.410 --> 07:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
came through this committee and
 
07:43:29.030 --> 07:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately ultimately was signed into
 
07:43:31.070 --> 07:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
law it is commonly referred to as gun
 
07:43:32.990 --> 07:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
sanctuary Bill and its language is
 
07:43:34.548 --> 07:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
modeled after immigration Sanctuary
 
07:43:36.110 --> 07:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
provisions and other states and cities
 
07:43:37.730 --> 07:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
across the United States the difference
 
07:43:39.590 --> 07:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
being this one solidified New
 
07:43:40.930 --> 07:43:40.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's dedication to protect
 
07:43:42.830 --> 07:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
protected citizens rights against
 
07:43:45.048 --> 07:43:45.058 align:start position:0%
Federal overreach
 
07:43:46.968 --> 07:43:46.978 align:start position:0%
this law was already covered in the
 
07:43:49.128 --> 07:43:49.138 align:start position:0%
hearings all during the day we've
 
07:43:50.570 --> 07:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned it many times so I'll focus on
 
07:43:52.368 --> 07:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
HP 474
 
07:43:55.368 --> 07:43:55.378 align:start position:0%
uh during the tank uh testimony for a
 
07:43:56.750 --> 07:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
sanctuary Bill one of the chief
 
07:43:58.310 --> 07:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
complaints from our citizens was the
 
07:44:00.530 --> 07:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
lack of penalties or teeth
 
07:44:02.628 --> 07:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
to any law enforcement that decided to
 
07:44:05.270 --> 07:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
ignore this New Hampshire law and Aid
 
07:44:07.010 --> 07:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
the feds in trampling our natural rights
 
07:44:08.868 --> 07:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
to keep and bear arms
 
07:44:11.448 --> 07:44:11.458 align:start position:0%
this bill corrects for that I consider
 
07:44:13.368 --> 07:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
it a government accountability bill it
 
07:44:15.048 --> 07:44:15.058 align:start position:0%
weighs qualified immunity and permits a
 
07:44:16.910 --> 07:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
wronged individual to have their day in
 
07:44:16.920 --> 07:44:17.930 align:start position:0%
wronged individual to have their day in
court

07:44:17.930 --> 07:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
court
 
07:44:17.940 --> 07:44:19.548 align:start position:0%
court
furthermore

07:44:19.548 --> 07:44:19.558 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
07:44:21.770 --> 07:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
I do not believe our state could benefit
 
07:44:23.690 --> 07:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
from employing federal agents that have
 
07:44:26.390 --> 07:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
disregarded our natural rights and bars
 
07:44:28.490 --> 07:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
them from employment if they have a
 
07:44:29.990 --> 07:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
history of doing so
 
07:44:32.090 --> 07:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
this type of Insidious perversion from
 
07:44:34.910 --> 07:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
within can ultimately would ultimately
 
07:44:36.590 --> 07:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
diminish the quality of law enforcement
 
07:44:38.330 --> 07:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
in the state dragging them down to the
 
07:44:39.948 --> 07:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
levels of the right trampoline the
 
07:44:43.190 --> 07:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
rights trampling federal agents
 
07:44:45.230 --> 07:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
we should be ostracizing individuals
 
07:44:47.690 --> 07:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
with this mindset not allowing them to
 
07:44:49.128 --> 07:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
train alongside or manage police
 
07:44:51.288 --> 07:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
departments and granted Staters
 
07:44:54.590 --> 07:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry or managed police departments
 
07:44:56.030 --> 07:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
with granted Staters that respect the
 
07:44:57.650 --> 07:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
rights of our citizens
 
07:45:00.110 --> 07:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
the militarization of police which has
 
07:45:01.850 --> 07:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
caused disharmony and strife in our
 
07:45:03.230 --> 07:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
communities traces back to Federal
 
07:45:05.330 --> 07:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
programs doctrines and enforcement of
 
07:45:06.708 --> 07:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
their laws
 
07:45:08.690 --> 07:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
if we hope to amend the distrust of law
 
07:45:12.048 --> 07:45:12.058 align:start position:0%
enforcement bills like HB 474 are a path
 
07:45:13.610 --> 07:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
towards it
 
07:45:15.530 --> 07:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
we should not
 
07:45:18.048 --> 07:45:18.058 align:start position:0%
be employing individuals that consider
 
07:45:19.730 --> 07:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
our rights an obstacle for them to
 
07:45:19.740 --> 07:45:21.110 align:start position:0%
our rights an obstacle for them to
overcome

07:45:21.110 --> 07:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
overcome
 
07:45:23.030 --> 07:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
and create arbitrary rules on the fly
 
07:45:25.850 --> 07:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
with no Congressional feedback only to
 
07:45:27.288 --> 07:45:27.298 align:start position:0%
eventually be struck down by courts
 
07:45:29.390 --> 07:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
after the harm has already been done I
 
07:45:32.270 --> 07:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
asked the committee to OTP hb474 and I'm
 
07:45:36.830 --> 07:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:38.750 --> 07:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony introducing
 
07:45:42.670 --> 07:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:46.930 --> 07:45:46.940 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes William Rogers
 
07:45:49.128 --> 07:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
I got it
 
07:45:52.250 --> 07:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
could read that one
 
07:45:53.810 --> 07:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
07:45:56.090 --> 07:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to see you Common Sense gun
 
07:45:59.750 --> 07:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
control bill on the floor finally
 
07:46:01.730 --> 07:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
I support this bill
 
07:46:04.750 --> 07:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
Federal reach is only getting worse
 
07:46:08.510 --> 07:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
as the federal government becomes more
 
07:46:10.490 --> 07:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
and more politicized and more and more
 
07:46:13.610 --> 07:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
weaponized we need to protect the the
 
07:46:15.948 --> 07:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
granite state people from from the
 
07:46:18.770 --> 07:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
federal laws I firmly support this Bill

07:46:40.850 --> 07:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
the question of self-protection keeps
 
07:46:42.310 --> 07:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
coming up today
 
07:46:44.750 --> 07:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
I support this bill
 
07:46:49.610 --> 07:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court in 1989 in the shade
 
07:46:52.190 --> 07:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
the Winnebago County of Social Services
 
07:46:56.090 --> 07:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
State stated the police had no duty to
 
07:46:56.100 --> 07:46:57.048 align:start position:0%
State stated the police had no duty to
protect

07:46:57.048 --> 07:46:57.058 align:start position:0%
protect
 
07:47:01.190 --> 07:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
in 1981 Warren the District of Columbia
 
07:47:03.770 --> 07:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
appeals court held police out of general
 
07:47:07.850 --> 07:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
duty but no specific legal Duty exists
 
07:47:09.250 --> 07:47:09.260 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
07:47:13.430 --> 07:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
in 2005 Castle Rock B Gonzalez sued the
 
07:47:16.070 --> 07:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
police for failing to protect her from
 
07:47:18.590 --> 07:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
her husband after he abducted and killed
 
07:47:20.690 --> 07:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
her three children justices said police
 
07:47:24.410 --> 07:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
had no such duty to protect them
 
07:47:27.770 --> 07:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the 11th circuit upheld the
 
07:47:29.990 --> 07:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
police were not liable for for not
 
07:47:32.208 --> 07:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
protecting students in Parkland Florida
 
07:47:35.208 --> 07:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
with 17 lives were lost
 
07:47:38.628 --> 07:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
this simply means we can protect
 
07:47:42.770 --> 07:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
ourselves and we should thank you
 
07:47:44.868 --> 07:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:47:51.410 --> 07:47:51.420 align:start position:0%

um I support and thank the prime sponsor
 
07:48:06.830 --> 07:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill it would enhance my 11 my
 
07:48:09.948 --> 07:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 1178.
 
07:48:14.208 --> 07:48:14.218 align:start position:0%
where the police cannot be used for a
 
07:48:17.208 --> 07:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
federal unconstitutional gun law so what
 
07:48:19.430 --> 07:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping for you guys to please do is
 
07:48:21.548 --> 07:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
support House Bill
 
07:48:25.730 --> 07:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
474 and itl the other bill of House Bill
 
07:48:28.548 --> 07:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
78 and then that way New Hampshire will
 
07:48:32.690 --> 07:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
be even a stronger and more safe and I
 
07:48:34.910 --> 07:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
trust me in that we will be the safest
 
07:48:38.810 --> 07:48:38.820 align:start position:0%

thank you for your testimony
 
07:48:55.548 --> 07:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:57.948 --> 07:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here today to urge you to support
 
07:49:00.708 --> 07:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
this bill I I don't understand why there
 
07:49:03.968 --> 07:49:03.978 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be penalties for a person
 
07:49:07.128 --> 07:49:07.138 align:start position:0%
violating the law under the auspices of
 
07:49:09.230 --> 07:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
their official duties
 
07:49:10.968 --> 07:49:10.978 align:start position:0%
um the construction of the New Hampshire
 
07:49:13.670 --> 07:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
and the federal Constitutions are such
 
07:49:13.680 --> 07:49:15.770 align:start position:0%
and the federal Constitutions are such
that

07:49:15.770 --> 07:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:49:18.650 --> 07:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment in article two are
 
07:49:22.250 --> 07:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
there to to guarantee our rights
 
07:49:24.468 --> 07:49:24.478 align:start position:0%
and the way they guarantee our rights is
 
07:49:26.868 --> 07:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
to restrict government
 
07:49:30.170 --> 07:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
is the infringer
 
07:49:32.270 --> 07:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
officially or unofficially on our
 
07:49:35.628 --> 07:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
natural rights so restrictions are good
 
07:49:38.810 --> 07:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
consequences are similarly good
 
07:49:40.788 --> 07:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I hope you support
 
07:49:42.410 --> 07:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:49:46.490 --> 07:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:49.368 --> 07:49:49.378 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Andrew Schuler is
 
07:49:51.968 --> 07:49:51.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:55.430 --> 07:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay we'll set his card aside uh
 
07:50:05.810 --> 07:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:07.310 --> 07:50:07.320 align:start position:0%

opportunity to testify on this bill uh
 
07:50:12.048 --> 07:50:12.058 align:start position:0%
police accountability is a hot issue on
 
07:50:13.730 --> 07:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
today's heated political climate this
 
07:50:15.530 --> 07:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
bill is a small step towards ensuring
 
07:50:17.330 --> 07:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
those who protect us don't abuse that
 
07:50:19.310 --> 07:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
trust the law requires that the state
 
07:50:20.750 --> 07:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
police do not cooperate with Federal
 
07:50:22.610 --> 07:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement without penalties this is
 
07:50:25.190 --> 07:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
merely a polite request this bill would
 
07:50:26.690 --> 07:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
fix that and send a message that police
 
07:50:28.368 --> 07:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
are not above the law merely because
 
07:50:29.990 --> 07:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
they enforced the law
 
07:50:31.968 --> 07:50:31.978 align:start position:0%
I wish to remind the committee why this
 
07:50:33.530 --> 07:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
law was required in the first place the
 
07:50:36.288 --> 07:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
ATF has become a rogue agency one that
 
07:50:38.150 --> 07:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily changes the rules in drastic
 
07:50:39.830 --> 07:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
ways that render thousands upon thousand
 
07:50:41.448 --> 07:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
people into being felons for only
 
07:50:43.910 --> 07:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
Firearms at the ATF themselves have
 
07:50:45.530 --> 07:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
approved of
 
07:50:47.150 --> 07:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
the rules they enforce and frequently
 
07:50:49.490 --> 07:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
change are not the result of changes in
 
07:50:51.830 --> 07:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
law made in Washington they are mayor
 
07:50:53.810 --> 07:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
rule changes put in place by unelected
 
07:50:56.208 --> 07:50:56.218 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats the ATF is not a simple
 
07:50:58.368 --> 07:50:58.378 align:start position:0%
regulatory body their primary purpose is
 
07:51:00.230 --> 07:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
tax collection when you make a
 
07:51:01.968 --> 07:51:01.978 align:start position:0%
short-barreled shotgun you are not a
 
07:51:04.368 --> 07:51:04.378 align:start position:0%
felon for possession of a shotgun it is
 
07:51:05.810 --> 07:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
perfectly legal to have a short barrel
 
07:51:08.270 --> 07:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
shotgun this is America no you only
 
07:51:10.190 --> 07:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
become a felon if you don't pay the tax
 
07:51:12.590 --> 07:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
on the shotgun the tax is two hundred
 
07:51:14.750 --> 07:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
dollars the ATF just changed the rules
 
07:51:16.010 --> 07:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
and made a wide variety of commonly
 
07:51:18.410 --> 07:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
owned pistols into short-barreled rifles
 
07:51:21.110 --> 07:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
which are taxed short-barreled rifles
 
07:51:23.868 --> 07:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
get taxed pistols do not despite nothing
 
07:51:25.610 --> 07:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
about the Firearms themselves being
 
07:51:27.650 --> 07:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
changed the ATF decided these Firearms
 
07:51:29.510 --> 07:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
are taxable and the punishment for not
 
07:51:31.430 --> 07:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
paying the tax is potentially fatal
 
07:51:33.350 --> 07:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
remember the Ruby Ridge Massacre was
 
07:51:35.448 --> 07:51:35.458 align:start position:0%
started over the potential sale of a
 
07:51:37.310 --> 07:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
short-barreled shotgun without the
 
07:51:40.070 --> 07:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
paying of the appropriate tax what
 
07:51:41.510 --> 07:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
happens to the people who didn't get the
 
07:51:43.368 --> 07:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
memo that the ATF changed their mind
 
07:51:45.770 --> 07:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
what is their fate when it is discovered
 
07:51:47.270 --> 07:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
that they didn't pay the tax on a
 
07:51:49.310 --> 07:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
short-barreled rifle they thought was a
 
07:51:51.650 --> 07:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
pistol why should everyday gun owners be
 
07:51:53.270 --> 07:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
required to become legal experts in
 
07:51:55.850 --> 07:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
order to exercise basic rights at least
 
07:51:57.530 --> 07:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
we can the least we can do is borrow
 
07:51:59.510 --> 07:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
police from helping the ATF this bill
 
07:52:01.010 --> 07:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
puts in reasonable penalties for
 
07:52:02.990 --> 07:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the Rogue agency please
 
07:52:06.468 --> 07:52:06.478 align:start position:0%
OTP hb474 thank you for your time
 
07:52:09.230 --> 07:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:52:17.448 --> 07:52:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:19.670 --> 07:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you again for listening to my
 
07:52:19.680 --> 07:52:21.610 align:start position:0%
thank you again for listening to my
testimony

07:52:21.610 --> 07:52:21.620 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
07:52:24.830 --> 07:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
I guess According to some people it's a
 
07:52:29.690 --> 07:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
natural right to die and close to 50 000
 
07:52:32.270 --> 07:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
people in this country die from gun
 
07:52:32.280 --> 07:52:33.730 align:start position:0%
people in this country die from gun
violence

07:52:33.730 --> 07:52:33.740 align:start position:0%
violence
 
07:52:40.010 --> 07:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:43.610 --> 07:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable again as I've stated
 
07:52:46.968 --> 07:52:46.978 align:start position:0%
before to pass Common Sense was
 
07:52:52.548 --> 07:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
and it's reasonable for the state to
 
07:52:57.230 --> 07:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
follow reasonable federal laws and this
 
07:53:00.410 --> 07:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
type of Statute takes us in the wrong
 
07:53:04.190 --> 07:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:06.048 --> 07:53:06.058 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
07:53:13.548 --> 07:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:16.070 --> 07:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
hi Johanna Gunners New Hampshire house
 
07:53:19.010 --> 07:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
bill I'm opposed I mean I'm up for this
 
07:53:21.350 --> 07:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
one sorry it's been after nine or ten in
 
07:53:24.590 --> 07:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
a row uh so you know we've already heard
 
07:53:25.910 --> 07:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
some arguments I'm not going to make uh
 
07:53:27.410 --> 07:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
the same ones but there's a few good
 
07:53:28.310 --> 07:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
things that I could bring up that
 
07:53:30.170 --> 07:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
haven't been brought up already
 
07:53:32.628 --> 07:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
um we we just heard about reasonableness
 
07:53:35.030 --> 07:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
and you know we want reasonable laws
 
07:53:37.010 --> 07:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
well wouldn't it be reasonable if
 
07:53:39.048 --> 07:53:39.058 align:start position:0%
someone violates their rights that they
 
07:53:40.128 --> 07:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
should actually have to pay some
 
07:53:42.170 --> 07:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
consequence for doing so that is one of
 
07:53:43.548 --> 07:53:43.558 align:start position:0%
the most reasonable things that
 
07:53:45.590 --> 07:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislators could possibly come up with
 
07:53:47.690 --> 07:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's accountability
 
07:53:49.850 --> 07:53:49.860 align:start position:0%
and I think that this does provide that
 
07:53:52.128 --> 07:53:52.138 align:start position:0%
we have the laws that do protect us from
 
07:53:54.350 --> 07:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
overreach of uh you know the things that
 
07:53:56.030 --> 07:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
are mentioned in here but uh you know
 
07:53:57.288 --> 07:53:57.298 align:start position:0%
one example in particular there's a
 
07:53:58.310 --> 07:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
recent rule you might have heard about
 
07:54:00.830 --> 07:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
pistol braces uh now being considered
 
07:54:03.830 --> 07:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
short power rifles and they are now
 
07:54:05.930 --> 07:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
going to require a tax stamp and a long
 
07:54:07.368 --> 07:54:07.378 align:start position:0%
process to go through millions of people
 
07:54:09.468 --> 07:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
have them I even know a few that have
 
07:54:12.288 --> 07:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
them and now those people are going to
 
07:54:13.968 --> 07:54:13.978 align:start position:0%
be felons if they don't get the tax
 
07:54:15.888 --> 07:54:15.898 align:start position:0%
stamp to pay for something they already
 
07:54:17.628 --> 07:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
had something interesting about these
 
07:54:20.150 --> 07:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
things they're not more lethal if
 
07:54:21.770 --> 07:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
someone holds a short barrel rifle
 
07:54:23.150 --> 07:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
they're actually a little less strong
 
07:54:24.650 --> 07:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
because the long sort of the barrel the
 
07:54:26.150 --> 07:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
less energy the bullet has when it comes
 
07:54:28.310 --> 07:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
out so not necessarily more lethal they
 
07:54:29.868 --> 07:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
might be more maneuverable but that is
 
07:54:31.430 --> 07:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
actually something that is very useful
 
07:54:33.888 --> 07:54:33.898 align:start position:0%
in a home situation for home defense is
 
07:54:35.208 --> 07:54:35.218 align:start position:0%
also very helpful for people with
 
07:54:36.948 --> 07:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
physical disabilities handicaps small
 
07:54:39.170 --> 07:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
people of smaller stature the reason why
 
07:54:40.548 --> 07:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
the braces were developed is because
 
07:54:41.930 --> 07:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
some people have maybe a physical
 
07:54:43.548 --> 07:54:43.558 align:start position:0%
difficulty holding it up now you might
 
07:54:44.990 --> 07:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
say they don't deserve they shouldn't
 
07:54:46.010 --> 07:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
have a firearm but there's something
 
07:54:46.968 --> 07:54:46.978 align:start position:0%
that just need a reasonable
 
07:54:48.708 --> 07:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
accommodation that's something we allow
 
07:54:50.690 --> 07:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
people for all things in society
 
07:54:52.788 --> 07:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
including surgery I was a surgeon I knew
 
07:54:54.110 --> 07:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
stock doctors that couldn't do certain
 
07:54:55.310 --> 07:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
things without having a reasonable
 
07:54:57.170 --> 07:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
accommodation and they were allowed to
 
07:54:58.610 --> 07:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
operate on people if they were given a
 
07:55:00.770 --> 07:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
stool or a certain prosthetic to use of
 
07:55:02.750 --> 07:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
some sort this is something that's very
 
07:55:03.948 --> 07:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
important to people and I think it's
 
07:55:06.410 --> 07:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
important to have a reasonable uh
 
07:55:08.030 --> 07:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
consequence to violating someone's
 
07:55:10.788 --> 07:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
rights so please pass this bill and uh
 
07:55:12.490 --> 07:55:12.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not taking any questions it's late
 
07:55:16.090 --> 07:55:16.100 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you for your testimony
 
07:55:22.490 --> 07:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:25.310 --> 07:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience
 
07:55:28.310 --> 07:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
she said in my car anyways uh so
 
07:55:31.850 --> 07:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
I would like to uh support this bill
 
07:55:33.590 --> 07:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh there's too many infringements
 
07:55:35.930 --> 07:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
generally with when
 
07:55:37.250 --> 07:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
the government like the FED isn't
 
07:55:38.690 --> 07:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
serving people
 
07:55:41.388 --> 07:55:41.398 align:start position:0%
there's a little incentive to change
 
07:55:43.610 --> 07:55:43.620 align:start position:0%
laws to serve the people and this
 
07:55:47.090 --> 07:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
thought is used to force the guaranteed
 
07:55:50.448 --> 07:55:50.458 align:start position:0%
to serve us and allow for
 
07:55:53.930 --> 07:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
yeah net Firearms as a natural right as
 
07:55:57.110 --> 07:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:01.310 --> 07:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
and I the idea here was of course
 
07:56:03.530 --> 07:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
or I support the forcing of the public
 
07:56:06.530 --> 07:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
officials to be served and by allowing
 
07:56:08.570 --> 07:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
other public servants like police to
 
07:56:13.128 --> 07:56:13.138 align:start position:0%
suit Force the potential to uh I guess
 
07:56:15.230 --> 07:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
can't take the punishment for having not
 
07:56:16.968 --> 07:56:16.978 align:start position:0%
served the
 
07:56:21.288 --> 07:56:21.298 align:start position:0%
people uh thanks that's all
 
07:56:24.230 --> 07:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:56:36.350 --> 07:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:38.868 --> 07:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
hi my name is still Aloo axelman I still
 
07:56:40.670 --> 07:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
live in Hooksett
 
07:56:42.468 --> 07:56:42.478 align:start position:0%
um I am speaking in support of house
 
07:56:44.690 --> 07:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
bill 474. I think it's a great Common
 
07:56:48.170 --> 07:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
Sense bill that would use a state law
 
07:56:50.690 --> 07:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
to protect our natural rights to
 
07:56:53.090 --> 07:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
property and self-defense and I think
 
07:56:54.650 --> 07:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's great that representative Manion
 
07:56:57.170 --> 07:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
put in some punishments in this bill
 
07:56:58.788 --> 07:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's in the form of a civil cause of
 
07:57:01.070 --> 07:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
action as opposed to criminal penalties
 
07:57:03.830 --> 07:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's great um I don't think it's
 
07:57:05.990 --> 07:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
too strong at all I think it's really
 
07:57:06.000 --> 07:57:07.310 align:start position:0%
too strong at all I think it's really
appropriate

07:57:07.310 --> 07:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
07:57:10.548 --> 07:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
that if law enforcement agents violate
 
07:57:12.650 --> 07:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
their oath of office violate the natural
 
07:57:15.110 --> 07:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
rights of the citizens they're sworn to
 
07:57:16.610 --> 07:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
protect that there should be a civil
 
07:57:18.830 --> 07:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
cause of action to send them in court
 
07:57:20.330 --> 07:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
for violating our rights
 
07:57:22.490 --> 07:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
so I urge you all to please support this
 
07:57:22.500 --> 07:57:23.510 align:start position:0%
so I urge you all to please support this
OTP

07:57:23.510 --> 07:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
07:57:25.010 --> 07:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm happy to take
 
07:57:25.020 --> 07:57:28.548 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm happy to take
questions

07:57:28.548 --> 07:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:30.948 --> 07:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
07:57:42.610 --> 07:57:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:44.750 --> 07:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
07:57:47.270 --> 07:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee this bill also although I
 
07:57:49.910 --> 07:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
support the concept I do not support the
 
07:57:52.670 --> 07:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
language it also gets a black ribbon
 
07:57:55.850 --> 07:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
and here's the problems that I see in
 
07:57:57.170 --> 07:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
the law we have a saying it's called
 
07:57:59.510 --> 07:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
sauce for the goose sauce for the gander
 
07:58:01.490 --> 07:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
which means each side needs to be
 
07:58:03.288 --> 07:58:03.298 align:start position:0%
treated equally
 
07:58:05.510 --> 07:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
there are certainly a lot of bad law
 
07:58:07.490 --> 07:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement I've had some retaliate
 
07:58:10.128 --> 07:58:10.138 align:start position:0%
against me personally but
 
07:58:12.590 --> 07:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
this does not make it clear will a
 
07:58:14.810 --> 07:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
person of average intelligence what is
 
07:58:17.570 --> 07:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
prohibited and just like we have to have
 
07:58:20.030 --> 07:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
speed someone be speed limit Lines on
 
07:58:21.948 --> 07:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
the Highway before we get pulled over
 
07:58:24.410 --> 07:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
for a ticket law enforcement needs to
 
07:58:27.110 --> 07:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
know what they can and can't do and I
 
07:58:28.730 --> 07:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
think what's most important to me here
 
07:58:30.110 --> 07:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
if any of you who followed the
 
07:58:32.150 --> 07:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence schedule or the
 
07:58:34.490 --> 07:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
Lori list there are certainly a lot of
 
07:58:36.410 --> 07:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
officers that were put on it that I'm
 
07:58:37.910 --> 07:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
not sure belonged on it and it was
 
07:58:39.888 --> 07:58:39.898 align:start position:0%
politics because your supervisor could
 
07:58:41.270 --> 07:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
put you on it
 
07:58:43.548 --> 07:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
there are also a ton of officers that
 
07:58:45.590 --> 07:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
need to be on it that aren't
 
07:58:49.730 --> 07:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
and so when you look at for example
 
07:58:54.888 --> 07:58:54.898 align:start position:0%
um 159e which is page 3 line 30.
 
07:58:57.468 --> 07:58:57.478 align:start position:0%
I want bad law enforcement more than
 
07:58:59.690 --> 07:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
anybody way more than anybody probably
 
07:59:02.990 --> 07:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
but they get hearings they get due
 
07:59:05.090 --> 07:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
process just like we do
 
07:59:07.430 --> 07:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I think all of us in
 
07:59:09.170 --> 07:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
order to have good law enforcement you
 
07:59:10.968 --> 07:59:10.978 align:start position:0%
have to treat them fairly
 
07:59:13.310 --> 07:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
and I think this bill is a wonderful
 
07:59:15.350 --> 07:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
concept but it needs to be retained and
 
07:59:17.388 --> 07:59:17.398 align:start position:0%
it needs to have a whole whole lot of
 
07:59:19.968 --> 07:59:19.978 align:start position:0%
work done to it because we need more
 
07:59:22.430 --> 07:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
specifics as to what you're prohibiting
 
07:59:24.110 --> 07:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
and what you consider to be a violation
 
07:59:26.330 --> 07:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
of our rights and I think there's a
 
07:59:28.730 --> 07:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
wholeness that can be put together but
 
07:59:30.590 --> 07:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
when you look at this
 
07:59:33.590 --> 07:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
the way it is now the other and most
 
07:59:35.930 --> 07:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
important thing which
 
07:59:38.330 --> 07:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
um prosecutor is going to be assigned to
 
07:59:40.368 --> 07:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
do this because if you don't assign them
 
07:59:43.128 --> 07:59:43.138 align:start position:0%
prosecutors have absolute prosecutorial
 
07:59:44.690 --> 07:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
discretion you won't have anybody
 
07:59:46.910 --> 07:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
bringing charges and that's a problem
 
07:59:49.310 --> 07:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
and I can think of Catherine Rogers when
 
07:59:51.590 --> 07:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
she was the county attorney and she and
 
07:59:54.048 --> 07:59:54.058 align:start position:0%
I agreed on little but one particular
 
07:59:56.810 --> 07:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
time when Brian blackton's
 
07:59:59.690 --> 07:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
camera was wrongfully seized short of
 
08:00:01.190 --> 08:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
the State Police to return it to him
 
08:00:03.830 --> 08:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
they refused her answer is who's going
 
08:00:05.628 --> 08:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
to bring be bringing your felony cases
 
08:00:07.730 --> 08:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack County boys
 
08:00:11.270 --> 08:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
and so you have to look at that and you
 
08:00:13.310 --> 08:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
have to say who specifically is going to
 
08:00:15.468 --> 08:00:15.478 align:start position:0%
be responsible for that and will that be
 
08:00:17.330 --> 08:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
a person who's willing to Buck the boys
 
08:00:19.548 --> 08:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
in blue and do whatever the right thing
 
08:00:21.650 --> 08:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
is but this is not clear it's not fair
 
08:00:23.750 --> 08:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
to the police quite frankly
 
08:00:25.850 --> 08:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
and coming out of my mouth people say
 
08:00:27.770 --> 08:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
penny Dean saying that but I'm like I'm
 
08:00:29.448 --> 08:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
for fairness
 
08:00:32.388 --> 08:00:32.398 align:start position:0%
and I just don't think this is fair and
 
08:00:32.398 --> 08:00:33.770 align:start position:0%
and I just don't think this is fair and
clear

08:00:33.770 --> 08:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
clear
 
08:00:35.150 --> 08:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:00:37.190 --> 08:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony to be clear
 
08:00:39.350 --> 08:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
on your card you you mark support are
 
08:00:40.610 --> 08:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
you good Amendment support with
 
08:00:43.968 --> 08:00:43.978 align:start position:0%
amendments so as is not support and as I
 
08:00:45.410 --> 08:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
would not support but support the
 
08:00:46.910 --> 08:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
concept and support with amendments
 
08:00:50.208 --> 08:00:50.218 align:start position:0%
because I support it but not in this
 
08:00:51.468 --> 08:00:51.478 align:start position:0%
language because I don't think it's
 
08:00:54.048 --> 08:00:54.058 align:start position:0%
workable and I would suggest a sponsor
 
08:00:55.730 --> 08:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
wherever he is take advantage of free
 
08:00:58.310 --> 08:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
legal advice and speak to people and
 
08:00:59.930 --> 08:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
again it's a one thank you to the
 
08:01:01.788 --> 08:01:01.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor and it's a good concept because
 
08:01:04.250 --> 08:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
we all need to be treated fairly but I
 
08:01:05.628 --> 08:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
just don't think it'll do what he wants
 
08:01:06.770 --> 08:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
it to do
 
08:01:10.310 --> 08:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:12.110 --> 08:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
anyone holding a pink crowd who hasn't
 
08:01:14.810 --> 08:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
turned it in yet there ain't none
 
08:01:18.610 --> 08:01:18.620 align:start position:0%
I hereby close the public hearing on
 
08:01:23.448 --> 08:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
hb474 and we are going to take a
 
08:01:29.810 --> 08:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:29.820 --> 08:01:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
huh

08:01:31.070 --> 08:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
huh
 
08:01:36.948 --> 08:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:36.958 --> 08:01:39.288 align:start position:0%
 
okay

08:01:39.288 --> 08:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:39.298 --> 08:08:43.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

08:08:43.090 --> 08:08:43.100 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:48.230 --> 08:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
at this time I call or open the public
 
08:08:51.770 --> 08:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 512 and recognize
 
08:08:56.270 --> 08:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:57.948 --> 08:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
 
08:08:57.958 --> 08:08:59.090 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
committee

08:08:59.090 --> 08:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
08:09:00.650 --> 08:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
you guys are definitely put in overtime
 
08:09:00.660 --> 08:09:02.690 align:start position:0%
you guys are definitely put in overtime
tonight

08:09:02.690 --> 08:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
08:09:07.250 --> 08:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 512 would allow any firearm or
 
08:09:08.990 --> 08:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
accessory that's made within and
 
08:09:10.490 --> 08:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
ammunition it covers a lot of things
 
08:09:12.350 --> 08:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
made within the confines of the State of
 
08:09:14.628 --> 08:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to not be subject to
 
08:09:16.368 --> 08:09:16.378 align:start position:0%
Federal jurisdiction
 
08:09:18.230 --> 08:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
so I was going to take a different tact
 
08:09:19.310 --> 08:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
because I have a feeling that the people
 
08:09:20.570 --> 08:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
behind we're going to cover the whole
 
08:09:22.968 --> 08:09:22.978 align:start position:0%
gun rights aspect of this and just go
 
08:09:25.030 --> 08:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
into how the federal government actually
 
08:09:27.530 --> 08:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
claims ownership over things that happen
 
08:09:31.628 --> 08:09:31.638 align:start position:0%
within a state so in 1940
 
08:09:34.730 --> 08:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
1942 to be specific there was a farmer
 
08:09:37.310 --> 08:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
in Ohio Roscoe filburn he produced a
 
08:09:38.930 --> 08:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
greater quantity of wheat than what
 
08:09:40.128 --> 08:09:40.138 align:start position:0%
Congress had allowed under the
 
08:09:42.288 --> 08:09:42.298 align:start position:0%
agricultural adjustment act they were
 
08:09:44.208 --> 08:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
trying to stabilize the price of wheat
 
08:09:46.910 --> 08:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
so he grew 23 Acres
 
08:09:49.010 --> 08:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
which was double what he was allotted by
 
08:09:51.590 --> 08:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
the powers that ought not be
 
08:09:53.208 --> 08:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
so writing through unanimous Supreme
 
08:09:53.218 --> 08:09:54.230 align:start position:0%
so writing through unanimous Supreme
Court

08:09:54.230 --> 08:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
Court
 
08:09:55.670 --> 08:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
they found that the Commerce Clause
 
08:09:57.350 --> 08:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
gives Congress the power to regulate
 
08:09:59.510 --> 08:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
prices in the industry and this law was
 
08:10:01.430 --> 08:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
rational rationally related to that
 
08:10:03.948 --> 08:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
legitimate goal okay he pointed out that
 
08:10:05.930 --> 08:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
filburn would not have needed to buy
 
08:10:07.548 --> 08:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
wheat if he had not used his own wheat
 
08:10:09.948 --> 08:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
for personal consumption so this man did
 
08:10:12.530 --> 08:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
not sell any Wheat over state lines he
 
08:10:15.170 --> 08:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
simply fed it to us his livestock and
 
08:10:17.330 --> 08:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
they claimed I'll finish up he pointed
 
08:10:19.010 --> 08:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
over would have needed to buy wheat if
 
08:10:20.388 --> 08:10:20.398 align:start position:0%
he had not used his own wheat for
 
08:10:21.770 --> 08:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
personal consumption
 
08:10:23.868 --> 08:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
so his choice still affected the
 
08:10:26.330 --> 08:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
national economy and Interstate Commerce
 
08:10:28.850 --> 08:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
by removing a buyer from the market
 
08:10:31.430 --> 08:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
so my whole argument would be
 
08:10:33.288 --> 08:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
it's absurd why is the federal
 
08:10:34.850 --> 08:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
government have the ability to tell us
 
08:10:37.730 --> 08:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
what we can own in this state if we as a
 
08:10:39.530 --> 08:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
legislature choose to Outlaw certain
 
08:10:41.270 --> 08:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
guns or accessories or whatever it may
 
08:10:43.310 --> 08:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
be let's do it fine let's have the
 
08:10:45.708 --> 08:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
debate here and figure it out but to to
 
08:10:48.430 --> 08:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
delegate that authority to a bunch of
 
08:10:50.330 --> 08:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
unelected bureaucrats because what's
 
08:10:52.010 --> 08:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
been going on with the ATF they say oh
 
08:10:53.448 --> 08:10:53.458 align:start position:0%
this is legal today that's not illegal
 
08:10:54.708 --> 08:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to go raid people's
 
08:10:56.570 --> 08:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
houses with no not warrants that bill is
 
08:10:58.730 --> 08:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
coming up tomorrow but the point being
 
08:11:01.610 --> 08:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
is I think we need to really
 
08:11:03.468 --> 08:11:03.478 align:start position:0%
well first off breathing Hampshire State
 
08:11:05.330 --> 08:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 7 State sovereignty
 
08:11:06.948 --> 08:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
and just say okay this is our state
 
08:11:09.288 --> 08:11:09.298 align:start position:0%
people within the state they want to
 
08:11:10.968 --> 08:11:10.978 align:start position:0%
produce a gun within the confines of the
 
08:11:10.978 --> 08:11:11.930 align:start position:0%
produce a gun within the confines of the
state

08:11:11.930 --> 08:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
state
 
08:11:13.310 --> 08:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's subject to this state's
 
08:11:16.788 --> 08:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction not the federalism so I had
 
08:11:18.048 --> 08:11:18.058 align:start position:0%
probably not going to have any questions
 
08:11:20.448 --> 08:11:20.458 align:start position:0%
but I'll take some
 
08:11:20.458 --> 08:11:22.070 align:start position:0%
but I'll take some
okay

08:11:22.070 --> 08:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:11:25.788 --> 08:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:32.448 --> 08:11:32.458 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:33.770 --> 08:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
08:11:35.030 --> 08:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tom minion
 
08:11:36.770 --> 08:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro One Pelham I'm here here to
 
08:11:39.708 --> 08:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
speak and support of hb512 the one thing
 
08:11:42.170 --> 08:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
we did cover my testimony is covering a
 
08:11:43.610 --> 08:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
lot of the exact same ground with the
 
08:11:46.070 --> 08:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
the filburn case I do believe that
 
08:11:47.570 --> 08:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
that's the impetus of a lot of the
 
08:11:48.708 --> 08:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
problems that we're seeing from the
 
08:11:49.670 --> 08:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
federal government where they just
 
08:11:52.070 --> 08:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
assume that because anything could
 
08:11:54.230 --> 08:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
potentially ever be sold across state
 
08:11:55.670 --> 08:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
lines it is now covered by the
 
08:11:57.288 --> 08:11:57.298 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause I completely
 
08:11:59.330 --> 08:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
disagree with this interpretation I
 
08:12:01.190 --> 08:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
think it's important now that we uh
 
08:12:03.230 --> 08:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
states with the current makeup of the
 
08:12:05.990 --> 08:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
scotus that we do begin to reevaluate
 
08:12:08.090 --> 08:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
this activist judged behavior from
 
08:12:10.910 --> 08:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
almost a century ago that has given us
 
08:12:12.410 --> 08:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
the monster Behemoth that is the federal
 
08:12:15.590 --> 08:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
government that we see today uh so I'm
 
08:12:18.650 --> 08:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
here speaking in in support OTP uh HP
 
08:12:20.330 --> 08:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
512 and I'm willing to take any of your
 
08:12:20.340 --> 08:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
512 and I'm willing to take any of your
questions

08:12:23.750 --> 08:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:27.948 --> 08:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:32.090 --> 08:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
the chair calls William Rogers
 
08:12:36.350 --> 08:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:45.888 --> 08:12:45.898 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:51.888 --> 08:12:51.898 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:53.930 --> 08:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you again for inviting me
 
08:12:57.410 --> 08:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
um so I think I support this bill
 
08:12:59.868 --> 08:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
um I think that the federal firearms
 
08:13:02.930 --> 08:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
laws especially NFA are arbitrarily
 
08:13:05.150 --> 08:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
enforced to see the recent ruling with
 
08:13:07.548 --> 08:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
the pistol brace Rule and I think that
 
08:13:08.810 --> 08:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens should have an
 
08:13:10.490 --> 08:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
option to opt out of Interstate Commerce
 
08:13:12.170 --> 08:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
and therefore these Federal Regulations
 
08:13:15.948 --> 08:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
as long as they the full in
 
08:13:19.310 --> 08:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
use of the Second Amendment or yeah
 
08:13:20.270 --> 08:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
resuming right two is the Second
 
08:13:21.650 --> 08:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment if within the state of New
 
08:13:22.610 --> 08:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shouldn't use federal
 
08:13:25.368 --> 08:13:25.378 align:start position:0%
regulations and the current regulations
 
08:13:26.690 --> 08:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
because there's arbitrarily
 
08:13:26.700 --> 08:13:28.128 align:start position:0%
because there's arbitrarily
unfortunately

08:13:28.128 --> 08:13:28.138 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
08:13:31.010 --> 08:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
it curates felons out of your neighbors
 
08:13:32.990 --> 08:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
and friends and family and there's
 
08:13:34.850 --> 08:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
nothing you can do about it
 
08:13:37.490 --> 08:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
and I'd also like to say that one part
 
08:13:39.288 --> 08:13:39.298 align:start position:0%
of the NFA you know it mentions all of
 
08:13:40.910 --> 08:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
the weapons well anything can be level
 
08:13:43.610 --> 08:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
up into some creativity and intent so
 
08:13:45.530 --> 08:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to just immediately
 
08:13:47.030 --> 08:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
make everything government regulated
 
08:13:49.010 --> 08:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
free New Hampshire residents from this
 
08:13:50.930 --> 08:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
over regulation I think that's all I had
 
08:13:52.490 --> 08:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
to say
 
08:13:55.128 --> 08:13:55.138 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony chair calls
 
08:14:01.070 --> 08:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:02.930 --> 08:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for hearing me today Joe
 
08:14:04.310 --> 08:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
Gunners New Hampshire this is everybody
 
08:14:07.190 --> 08:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
after five o'clock version of testifying
 
08:14:08.868 --> 08:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh we're in support of the bill
 
08:14:12.170 --> 08:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's very important that uh
 
08:14:14.750 --> 08:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
we we realize that this is as needed as
 
08:14:16.010 --> 08:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
this bill is it's going to be a very
 
08:14:17.510 --> 08:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
limited scope it's got to be
 
08:14:19.850 --> 08:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
manufactured in New Hampshire for actual
 
08:14:21.288 --> 08:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
Firearms accessories are a little
 
08:14:23.628 --> 08:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
different in the bill but uh it's you
 
08:14:25.010 --> 08:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
know we're not gonna have to more you
 
08:14:25.020 --> 08:14:25.670 align:start position:0%
know we're not gonna have to more you
know

08:14:25.670 --> 08:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
08:14:27.230 --> 08:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
um pull the iron out of the ground
 
08:14:29.270 --> 08:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves and get the ore but you're
 
08:14:30.530 --> 08:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
gonna have to make everything from the
 
08:14:33.650 --> 08:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
raw materials uh that's a very intensive
 
08:14:34.910 --> 08:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
process but it's actually a very
 
08:14:36.048 --> 08:14:36.058 align:start position:0%
exciting process for New Hampshire
 
08:14:38.090 --> 08:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of potential business and
 
08:14:40.368 --> 08:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
development opportunities this could uh
 
08:14:42.708 --> 08:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
could bring about and made New Hampshire
 
08:14:44.750 --> 08:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
is something that we're very proud of uh
 
08:14:46.910 --> 08:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know I'm wearing limber boots from
 
08:14:48.770 --> 08:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
up and up in you know the White
 
08:14:50.628 --> 08:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
Mountains they're the oldest boot in the
 
08:14:53.090 --> 08:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
country right you should try them but um
 
08:14:55.250 --> 08:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
anyway I I'm I think you should really
 
08:14:57.948 --> 08:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
consider passing this the only uh
 
08:15:00.170 --> 08:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
comment I would make is uh and I'm not
 
08:15:01.910 --> 08:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
against it but I think you know I'd be
 
08:15:03.948 --> 08:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
willing to bend on the the penalty parts
 
08:15:05.810 --> 08:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
of Class A misdemeanor and class B
 
08:15:07.368 --> 08:15:07.378 align:start position:0%
felony I think like I said before
 
08:15:08.570 --> 08:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
punishments are definitely something
 
08:15:10.968 --> 08:15:10.978 align:start position:0%
they're needed but I'm not sure seven
 
08:15:13.310 --> 08:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
years in prison is the acceptable
 
08:15:15.650 --> 08:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
response some people may differ uh but
 
08:15:17.690 --> 08:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
there should be some penalties but um
 
08:15:19.368 --> 08:15:19.378 align:start position:0%
I'm up for negotiation if these are
 
08:15:20.628 --> 08:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
something that would be sticking points
 
08:15:23.388 --> 08:15:23.398 align:start position:0%
for some some members thank you and good
 
08:15:23.398 --> 08:15:24.708 align:start position:0%
for some some members thank you and good
night

08:15:24.708 --> 08:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
night
 
08:15:26.990 --> 08:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and the
 
08:15:28.310 --> 08:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
chair calls
 
08:15:36.650 --> 08:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:40.070 --> 08:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
I support this bill I I think New
 
08:15:41.750 --> 08:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire made firearm to be a great
 
08:15:44.388 --> 08:15:44.398 align:start position:0%
thing and that we should regulate it in
 
08:15:45.948 --> 08:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
state and completely out of federal
 
08:15:48.530 --> 08:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
control thank you
 
08:15:59.750 --> 08:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:01.910 --> 08:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you again for
 
08:16:08.270 --> 08:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:10.250 --> 08:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should give a free pass
 
08:16:13.610 --> 08:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
to any manufacturer
 
08:16:17.208 --> 08:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
whether due to faulty guns or faulty
 
08:16:17.218 --> 08:16:18.468 align:start position:0%
whether due to faulty guns or faulty
cars

08:16:18.468 --> 08:16:18.478 align:start position:0%
cars
 
08:16:20.810 --> 08:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
or anything that's fought the nor should
 
08:16:24.410 --> 08:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
we allow any manufacturer to falsely
 
08:16:24.420 --> 08:16:26.330 align:start position:0%
we allow any manufacturer to falsely
advertise

08:16:26.330 --> 08:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
advertise
 
08:16:29.510 --> 08:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
and promote products that malfunction
 
08:16:32.090 --> 08:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
and cause harm
 
08:16:34.250 --> 08:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think we should give a
 
08:16:37.910 --> 08:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
pass to a company that makes
 
08:16:41.510 --> 08:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
a firearm or a firearm accessory in New
 
08:16:44.690 --> 08:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if it's malfunctions
 
08:16:46.490 --> 08:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
we should
 
08:16:51.048 --> 08:16:51.058 align:start position:0%
insist that all products made in New
 
08:16:54.948 --> 08:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh function properly
 
08:16:58.010 --> 08:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
guns killed and it's obviously important
 
08:17:01.368 --> 08:17:01.378 align:start position:0%
that gun manufacturers produce safe guns
 
08:17:05.628 --> 08:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
and safe devices and this law would
 
08:17:05.638 --> 08:17:07.610 align:start position:0%
and safe devices and this law would
allow

08:17:07.610 --> 08:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
allow
 
08:17:11.030 --> 08:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
great exceptions to that basic principle
 
08:17:13.190 --> 08:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
08:17:15.948 --> 08:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony
 
08:17:21.948 --> 08:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:17:23.208 --> 08:17:23.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
08:17:25.128 --> 08:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
committee the interstate commerce clause
 
08:17:26.690 --> 08:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
has been abused for a very long time
 
08:17:28.368 --> 08:17:28.378 align:start position:0%
this bill does something very small to
 
08:17:29.930 --> 08:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
help Granite State businesses operate
 
08:17:31.250 --> 08:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
smoothly in an area where federal
 
08:17:33.170 --> 08:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
government tries its darndest to usurp
 
08:17:35.150 --> 08:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
the power of the states it wields the
 
08:17:36.410 --> 08:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause like a
 
08:17:38.090 --> 08:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
sledgehammer everything that can
 
08:17:39.468 --> 08:17:39.478 align:start position:0%
potentially be bought or sold May
 
08:17:41.330 --> 08:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
apparently be regulated by the federal
 
08:17:43.070 --> 08:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
government their army of bureaucrat
 
08:17:44.810 --> 08:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
stands ready to tell everyone what to do
 
08:17:46.730 --> 08:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
at all times unless States come in and
 
08:17:48.110 --> 08:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
protect their citizens and their
 
08:17:49.968 --> 08:17:49.978 align:start position:0%
businesses this bill would protect New
 
08:17:51.530 --> 08:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire firearm manufacturers from an
 
08:17:53.150 --> 08:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of bureaucracy we love
 
08:17:54.830 --> 08:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
our local businesses every dollar they
 
08:17:56.208 --> 08:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
spend on compliance is another dollar
 
08:17:57.830 --> 08:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
they have to they can't spend on our
 
08:18:00.110 --> 08:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce this bill doesn't spare them
 
08:18:01.310 --> 08:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
the wrath of regulators when the
 
08:18:03.048 --> 08:18:03.058 align:start position:0%
manufacturers export their products to
 
08:18:05.448 --> 08:18:05.458 align:start position:0%
other states therefore any firearms
 
08:18:07.250 --> 08:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
company that wishes to have Safe
 
08:18:08.750 --> 08:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
products that are sold in other states
 
08:18:10.968 --> 08:18:10.978 align:start position:0%
they will be making sure that their uh
 
08:18:13.490 --> 08:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
their products are safe uh you guys are
 
08:18:14.810 --> 08:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
probably eager to get out of dive so
 
08:18:17.208 --> 08:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
I'll leave with that thank you very much
 
08:18:19.310 --> 08:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
08:18:26.930 --> 08:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:28.610 --> 08:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
hi thank you my name is still Olu
 
08:18:30.590 --> 08:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
axelman I still live in Hooksett
 
08:18:32.388 --> 08:18:32.398 align:start position:0%
um I'm speaking in support of house bill
 
08:18:35.930 --> 08:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
512. I think it's a simple bill that
 
08:18:38.810 --> 08:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
just reasserts our 10th Amendment type
 
08:18:40.670 --> 08:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
states rights that the state is supposed
 
08:18:43.070 --> 08:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
to be Sovereign as per article 7 of the
 
08:18:44.990 --> 08:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution like a few
 
08:18:46.670 --> 08:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
others alluded to today the federal
 
08:18:48.830 --> 08:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
government for decades now maybe 100
 
08:18:50.628 --> 08:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
years has been using the Commerce Clause
 
08:18:52.310 --> 08:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution
 
08:18:54.770 --> 08:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
to say they can control everything in
 
08:18:57.170 --> 08:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
the universe and here's how the Supreme
 
08:18:59.388 --> 08:18:59.398 align:start position:0%
Court ruled in wickard versus filburn
 
08:19:03.468 --> 08:19:03.478 align:start position:0%
like 80 years ago that even if a person
 
08:19:06.708 --> 08:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh grows grain wheat on his own property
 
08:19:08.570 --> 08:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
feeds it to his own cows because
 
08:19:10.670 --> 08:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
theoretically he's feeding us cows from
 
08:19:12.708 --> 08:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
his own grow and not buying it from the
 
08:19:13.968 --> 08:19:13.978 align:start position:0%
neighboring state because he lived on
 
08:19:15.770 --> 08:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
the border of Iowa and Nebraska or
 
08:19:18.110 --> 08:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
something technically the price of the
 
08:19:20.208 --> 08:19:20.218 align:start position:0%
market of wheat could be affected
 
08:19:22.430 --> 08:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
because he's growing his own therefore
 
08:19:23.868 --> 08:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
anything in the universe that could
 
08:19:26.208 --> 08:19:26.218 align:start position:0%
affect any price of anything ever
 
08:19:28.190 --> 08:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
could be interstate commerce because it
 
08:19:30.048 --> 08:19:30.058 align:start position:0%
affects prices and I think wicker versus
 
08:19:31.548 --> 08:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
Phil Burton which might have been the
 
08:19:33.708 --> 08:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
most Broad and terrible Supreme Court
 
08:19:35.448 --> 08:19:35.458 align:start position:0%
case in history of existence
 
08:19:36.590 --> 08:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
um but there are a lot to choose from
 
08:19:38.330 --> 08:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
that was one of the worst things and
 
08:19:39.110 --> 08:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's what allowed the federal
 
08:19:40.968 --> 08:19:40.978 align:start position:0%
government to say anything is Commerce
 
08:19:43.310 --> 08:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
If I Grow something if I collect my own
 
08:19:44.810 --> 08:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
rain water and I buy less Poland Spring
 
08:19:47.270 --> 08:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
from Maine I'm affecting the price and
 
08:19:48.288 --> 08:19:48.298 align:start position:0%
it's interstate from New Hampshire
 
08:19:50.150 --> 08:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
domain so it's obviously Preposterous
 
08:19:52.070 --> 08:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
any three-year-old with 12 brain cells
 
08:19:54.230 --> 08:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
understands that it's way too far and
 
08:19:55.610 --> 08:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
this pushes back a little bit on this
 
08:19:57.590 --> 08:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause by saying things made in
 
08:20:00.468 --> 08:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
the state by Ruger or Sig Sauer kept in
 
08:20:02.990 --> 08:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
the state and carried by me my Sega my
 
08:20:04.910 --> 08:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
hip the federal government should have
 
08:20:07.010 --> 08:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
zero involvement at all there's there's
 
08:20:09.110 --> 08:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
no justification for it and it'll be a
 
08:20:10.490 --> 08:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
violation it was half Amendment and
 
08:20:11.690 --> 08:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
under the use of their Converse clause
 
08:20:13.368 --> 08:20:13.378 align:start position:0%
which I reject so thank you very much
 
08:20:16.448 --> 08:20:16.458 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:19.788 --> 08:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
08:20:27.048 --> 08:20:27.058 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:29.030 --> 08:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you take two and my name was much
 
08:20:30.230 --> 08:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
better this time
 
08:20:33.170 --> 08:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
I am speaking in support of this house
 
08:20:37.010 --> 08:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
bill 512. and I wanted to say I
 
08:20:39.530 --> 08:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
generally on principle it is my firm
 
08:20:42.590 --> 08:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
belief that any laws restricting guns
 
08:20:45.708 --> 08:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
accessories Etc is a violation of the
 
08:20:48.350 --> 08:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution but let's think even more
 
08:20:51.170 --> 08:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
just practically for a moment as many of
 
08:20:53.930 --> 08:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
others have alluded already a lot of
 
08:20:56.530 --> 08:20:56.540 align:start position:0%
federal gun laws are
 
08:20:59.448 --> 08:20:59.458 align:start position:0%
ill-informed at best and schizophrenic
 
08:21:01.968 --> 08:21:01.978 align:start position:0%
at worst you know a law can be passed
 
08:21:04.190 --> 08:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
with no grandfathering Clause that turns
 
08:21:06.170 --> 08:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
millions of law-abiding people
 
08:21:08.868 --> 08:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
suddenly into criminals they can't even
 
08:21:11.810 --> 08:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
go and you know address the law
 
08:21:14.410 --> 08:21:14.420 align:start position:0%
themselves already there are Criminal
 
08:21:16.910 --> 08:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
there are all sorts of laws that are not
 
08:21:19.490 --> 08:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
based in any real science or reason for
 
08:21:22.070 --> 08:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
example silencers have all sorts of
 
08:21:23.810 --> 08:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
restrictions and rules on them and are
 
08:21:25.868 --> 08:21:25.878 align:start position:0%
outright and illegal in many places
 
08:21:28.670 --> 08:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
silencers realistically are a tool to
 
08:21:30.650 --> 08:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
preserve people's hearing when they're
 
08:21:30.660 --> 08:21:31.788 align:start position:0%
preserve people's hearing when they're
shooting

08:21:31.788 --> 08:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
shooting
 
08:21:31.798 --> 08:21:32.388 align:start position:0%
shooting
um

08:21:32.388 --> 08:21:32.398 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:21:34.310 --> 08:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know if people think that
 
08:21:36.468 --> 08:21:36.478 align:start position:0%
Hollywood and video game rules apply to
 
08:21:38.150 --> 08:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
these things where it's you can simply
 
08:21:39.650 --> 08:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
shoot somebody and someone five feet
 
08:21:42.830 --> 08:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
away has no clue that is certainly
 
08:21:44.690 --> 08:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
ridiculous to me and there's all sorts
 
08:21:46.548 --> 08:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
of things like this in the legal code if
 
08:21:49.670 --> 08:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
you look so I think the people of New
 
08:21:51.708 --> 08:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Pride themselves on being free
 
08:21:53.628 --> 08:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
there are certainly a culture of Freedom
 
08:21:55.610 --> 08:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis guns and other things in this
 
08:21:57.110 --> 08:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
state it's one of the reasons that I
 
08:21:59.930 --> 08:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
moved six months ago and I simply do not
 
08:22:01.910 --> 08:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
wish to be under the purvey of the
 
08:22:03.888 --> 08:22:03.898 align:start position:0%
federal government that can arbitrarily
 
08:22:06.110 --> 08:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
impose whatever they like at any time
 
08:22:07.788 --> 08:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
it's ridiculous
 
08:22:09.288 --> 08:22:09.298 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little surprised it's taken
 
08:22:12.170 --> 08:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
this long to kind of bring this up so I
 
08:22:14.330 --> 08:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
very much support this Bill thank you
 
08:22:15.590 --> 08:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
08:22:18.410 --> 08:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
08:22:25.070 --> 08:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:27.170 --> 08:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
for the last time today I believe I hope
 
08:22:27.180 --> 08:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
for the last time today I believe I hope
so

08:22:28.070 --> 08:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:22:29.990 --> 08:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
until Friday I guess
 
08:22:31.490 --> 08:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
um I support the bill I won't believe
 
08:22:33.530 --> 08:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
belabor the points over and over again
 
08:22:36.888 --> 08:22:36.898 align:start position:0%
enough's been said thank you
 
08:22:39.288 --> 08:22:39.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and the
 
08:23:03.070 --> 08:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:05.930 --> 08:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
I support this bill and I ask you vote
 
08:23:08.570 --> 08:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
ought to pass this is fundamental
 
08:23:10.368 --> 08:23:10.378 align:start position:0%
fairness for gun owners gun
 
08:23:13.190 --> 08:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and dealers let me tell
 
08:23:16.070 --> 08:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
you just about three basic things Native
 
08:23:19.190 --> 08:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
Americans had a term he speak with fork
 
08:23:21.708 --> 08:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
tongue and what that basically means is
 
08:23:23.810 --> 08:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
people lied and changed their mind and
 
08:23:25.548 --> 08:23:25.558 align:start position:0%
went back on their deals
 
08:23:27.948 --> 08:23:27.958 align:start position:0%
here's why that matters there's three
 
08:23:30.410 --> 08:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
recent things in our lifetime that's
 
08:23:32.090 --> 08:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
happened to gun owners in this state
 
08:23:34.190 --> 08:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
with the ATF
 
08:23:38.030 --> 08:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
street sweepers FRG triggers and bump
 
08:23:38.040 --> 08:23:39.410 align:start position:0%
street sweepers FRG triggers and bump
stacks

08:23:39.410 --> 08:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
stacks
 
08:23:41.750 --> 08:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
the man who initially
 
08:23:44.270 --> 08:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
or men and companies who initially
 
08:23:46.788 --> 08:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
marketed each one of those got what I
 
08:23:49.310 --> 08:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
call a good boy letter from the ATF they
 
08:23:52.070 --> 08:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
submitted it to the ATF the ATF said
 
08:23:54.948 --> 08:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
this is how we characterize it
 
08:23:57.590 --> 08:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
and then the next thing you know the ATF
 
08:23:59.208 --> 08:23:59.218 align:start position:0%
said for example when it came to bump
 
08:24:01.430 --> 08:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
stocks you can thank anti-gun president
 
08:24:03.468 --> 08:24:03.478 align:start position:0%
Trump for this one
 
08:24:06.468 --> 08:24:06.478 align:start position:0%
they said when it came to bump Stacks oh
 
08:24:08.990 --> 08:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
no these are full Autos now they had a
 
08:24:11.388 --> 08:24:11.398 align:start position:0%
letter an opinion nothing hadn't changed
 
08:24:14.030 --> 08:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
on them other than politics
 
08:24:16.548 --> 08:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
they have the FR tree triggers right now
 
08:24:18.170 --> 08:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
people paid three to five hundred
 
08:24:20.270 --> 08:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
dollars for those triggers
 
08:24:23.270 --> 08:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and anyone who has one lately has
 
08:24:25.548 --> 08:24:25.558 align:start position:0%
been getting letters from the ATF that
 
08:24:26.990 --> 08:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
says either forfeit them or we're going
 
08:24:29.270 --> 08:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
to come arrest you and seize them I have
 
08:24:30.830 --> 08:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
plenty of clients with those letters
 
08:24:33.110 --> 08:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
because they went to the manufacturing
 
08:24:35.030 --> 08:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
the seller of those and seized all their
 
08:24:37.190 --> 08:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
records so they knew they sent them to a
 
08:24:39.830 --> 08:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
person a and person B and person C sent
 
08:24:41.448 --> 08:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
them letters
 
08:24:44.090 --> 08:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
and if you don't do the right thing when
 
08:24:45.948 --> 08:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
you turn them over to the ATF meaning
 
08:24:48.110 --> 08:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
the proper legal things
 
08:24:50.868 --> 08:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
you lose your right to get them back if
 
08:24:53.150 --> 08:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
there's any lawsuits or anything that
 
08:24:55.430 --> 08:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
matters I have several cases of those
 
08:24:57.770 --> 08:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
going right now and the clients know
 
08:25:00.888 --> 08:25:00.898 align:start position:0%
Freedom isn't free and to handle each
 
08:25:02.690 --> 08:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
okay we should talk in thousands of
 
08:25:06.708 --> 08:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
dollars for 350 or 340 thing but for
 
08:25:08.448 --> 08:25:08.458 align:start position:0%
those clients it's principal they're not
 
08:25:10.368 --> 08:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
going to turn over products
 
08:25:12.708 --> 08:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
without having a chance to get them back
 
08:25:14.868 --> 08:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
but if you see the ATF at your door and
 
08:25:16.310 --> 08:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
they say you give it to us now or we're
 
08:25:17.628 --> 08:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
coming to your house we're taking it and
 
08:25:19.548 --> 08:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
we're charging with a felony that's
 
08:25:21.230 --> 08:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
pretty scary and you're like wait a
 
08:25:23.030 --> 08:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
minute here's a letter yeah we rescinded
 
08:25:25.190 --> 08:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
that letter years later oh is there a
 
08:25:27.350 --> 08:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
trick are you no we just rescinded it
 
08:25:29.930 --> 08:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
