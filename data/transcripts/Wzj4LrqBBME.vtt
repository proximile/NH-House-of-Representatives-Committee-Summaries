00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.550 align:start position:0%
i believe about six or seven months ago
late

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
late part of last year i've been to two
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
meetings um over the past six months
 
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay welcome d on a scale of zero to ten
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
where do you think you are at in terms
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
of knowing about the department are you
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
just climbing the learning curve are you
 
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
sort of already up there a bit you're
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
referring to hhs yes
 
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.230 align:start position:0%
referring to hhs yes
um

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
i would say that um from my time i'm a
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
first-time representative and for my
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
time here
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
i would say i'm on the learning curve
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm also on the new hampshire
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
but also have practice medicine in the
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
state for 40 years so i am familiar with
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
several people
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
in the hospital association and
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
in health care in the state itself so
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
you're a physician i am a physician okay
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
so the way i run my meetings which is
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
different than the way
 
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:13.749 align:start position:0%
different than the way
uh

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative pearson does a little bit
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
is that if you
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on somebody's comment
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
just let me know i'm a little hard of
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
seeing so to let me know
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
and then i tend to just let you continue
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
to ask follow-on questions as long as
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh consistent with the questioning that
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're following i i don't make a big
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
deal of you coming back every time and
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
asking for a follow-up just as long as
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
you're keeping a normal dialogue i'm
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay with that but i do reserve the
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
right to cut you off if i don't think
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's doing i appreciate that i haven't
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
haven't been in the or for many years
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not shy so good good good yeah just
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
as long as you don't cut on anyone today
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
okay so so with that introduction um i
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
would like
 
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.189 align:start position:0%

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
good morning um
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
very pleased to provide an update on
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
how the transition is going and how we
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
are ensuring
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
that this facility is is fitting the
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
needs of new hampshire youth and
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
families hampstead hospital and
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facility
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
and so on that day the state assumed
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
ownership and we brought in well path
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
recovery solutions to provide the
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
clinical operations for the next two
 
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.350 align:start position:0%
clinical operations for the next two
years

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh transition has been remarkably smooth
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's really been no disruption to
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
the high standards of patient care that
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
we've all come to expect at hampstead
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh recovery solutions is successfully
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
providing both clinical services and
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
programming they're also providing a
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
number of other key
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
functions across the facility ranging
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
from housekeeping to building safety
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical services etc
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
staffing capacity and our census has
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
remained strong
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
and that has enabled our children's
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
weightless to remain
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
quite low as you've probably seen
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
i think one of the main drivers of
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
consistency and stability at hampstead
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
has really been the fact that
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
the workforce is the same workforce that
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
has been dedicated to that facility for
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
so many years
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
all of those workers were invited to
 
00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
all of those workers were invited to
become

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
recovery solutions employees and as we
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
anticipated most of them
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
accepted that opportunity so the vast
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
majority stayed at the hospital and then
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
of course recovery solutions did the due
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
diligence to ensure that these were the
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
most qualified and appropriate um
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
employees to fulfill the hospital's
 
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.430 align:start position:0%
employees to fulfill the hospital's
mission

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
mission
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
they also held numerous town halls
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
one-on-one meetings benefit meetings
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
just to ensure that all of those
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
employees felt supported in the
 
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.069 align:start position:0%
employees felt supported in the
transition

00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
another aspect of stability has been
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
kathy collins remaining at the helm of
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
that facility so she was ceo at the time
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
that the transaction that the purchase
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
occurred she was also operating as
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
interim ceo and now kathy is a dhhs
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
employee serving as ceo of hampstead um
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
so that has really continued the
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
continuity that we um that we
 
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.590 align:start position:0%
continuity that we um that we
prioritized

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
prioritized
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
we are in constant contact with our
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
federal partners to ensure that all of
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
the steps around accreditation and
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement remain on track um our
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid application has been finalized
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
and approved
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
that's for new hampshire we're
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
continuing to work on other states and
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
then we are in the process of finalizing
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
our medicare steps which are important
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
for continued accreditation
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
so i just want to talk a little bit
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
about growth because part of the idea
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
here is not just that the state is
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
taking on ownership of this hospital but
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we are growing to fulfill um
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
greater needs in the community uh
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh uh thanks for
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
letting me interrupt um
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
i before you get into the growth yeah i
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
i'd like to establish a baseline of
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
where we're at because we are
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
broadcasting and i don't know the number
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
of citizens that are watching so so if
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
we could just um have you in 60 seconds
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
or less
 
00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:29.269 align:start position:0%
or less
address

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
what the mission is of this organization
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
um what the physical capacity is of that
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
what the staff limited capacity is given
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
you know that everyone's having a hard
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
what new relationships
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be developed for
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
us to succeed in our mission
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
i think i just got cut off as i was
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
writing my note oh what has you worried
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's a new thing
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
you're juggling
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
20 things yeah what are the two or three
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
things that has you worried yeah and
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
just if we could get that footprint sure
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
then we can talk about growth additional
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
growth sounds like a plan so in short um
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
well i don't have the mission statement
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
here in front to paraphrase our mission
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
is to provide
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
the highest quality
 
00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:24.790 align:start position:0%
the highest quality
accessible

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
cost-effective care to new hampshire
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
youth and families
 
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.829 align:start position:0%
youth and families
that

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
that we possibly can at this facility in
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
line with the the department's mission
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
in line with the state's obligation to
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
um the communities we serve
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of physical capacity there are
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
it varies day-to-day depending on the
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
acuity and the emilio makeup of patients
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
um so there are different
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
rooming and unit arrangements but
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
roughly 45 to 55 young people can be
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
accommodated at any one time and i'll
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
speak in a minute to some of the
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
expansion plans
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of staffing capacity hampstead
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
is not immune from the ubiquitous
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
staffing challenges that we see across
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
all healthcare facilities in the state
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
but what we can say is there has been a
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
high degree of stability
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
even though we may have some vacancies
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to nursing
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to youth
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
counselors who are sort of those key
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
personnel who are running the units
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
we've been able to work with
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
with recovery solutions to provide an
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
arrangements including locums per diems
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
temporary staff to to maintain
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
short-term stability as we work on
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
longer-term strategies with them to to
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
hire and retain a larger workforce so
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's really no immediate
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
urgent concerns it's more about planning
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the long term how to recruit and
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
retain the highest qualified staff
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of new relationships i think
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's exciting about
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
this transaction is that it builds on
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
the work we've been doing for many years
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
around our children's system of care so
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
hampstead has been since 2019 when
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
youth were moved from new hampshire
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
hospital to hampstead hospital
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
many new relationships evolved to ensure
 
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.710 align:start position:0%
many new relationships evolved to ensure
that

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
both when youth come into the facility
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
as well as when they're discharged warm
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
handoffs are made with community
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
partners and with our array of other
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
continuum services so that that youth
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
has a really supportive place to land
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
back in their community with appropriate
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
care what i think is exciting about this
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
moment is that we are strengthening all
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
of those aspects we just met with the
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate last week
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
to ensure that her office is key in
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
helping us build and establish
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
all of those continued services to build
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
out um this system of care
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
that was a little more than 60 seconds
 
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.710 align:start position:0%
that was a little more than 60 seconds
but

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
well you did great um and so i don't
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
know that you hit the uh what has you
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
worried oh right
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
and then i thought of another one yeah
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
as you look at the population outside of
 
00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:54.069 align:start position:0%
as you look at the population outside of
hampstead

00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
hampstead
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
maybe you're not calling it a wait list
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
maybe you just have a list of people
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
with unmet needs that hampstead would be
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
the ideal place to put them if you could
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
give us some idea of how many people
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
might fit into that that bolus of
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
patients that we still want to take care
 
00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:10.230 align:start position:0%
patients that we still want to take care
of

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
so it's very difficult to quantify
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
demand for services particularly at the
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
moment we're in in a population health
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
sense which is that we know
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
rates of anxiety depression and other
 
00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:25.430 align:start position:0%
rates of anxiety depression and other
psychological

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
psychological
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
conditions are on the rise coming out of
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
the acute phase of the pandemic what is
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes hard to predict is when you
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
expand capacity how much that demand
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
will will be affected i think one of the
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
most important and this speaks to the
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
challenging part of what we are trying
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
to build at this facility is to
 
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.110 align:start position:0%
to build at this facility is to
establish

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
establish
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the contractor
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
recovery solutions the first ever
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
facility in the state of new hampshire
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's hard to
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
overstate how transformational this
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
development will be
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
to date when a young person is not
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
thriving in any other psychiatric or
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
residential setting
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
our only options as a state are to find
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
placements if we can oftentimes halfway
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
or across the country
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's really heartbreaking for those of
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
us in positions where we want to
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
establish those family family-driven
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
community-driven sets of services what
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
the prtf here in new hampshire will
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
allow is for us to be local here in the
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
community providing some of these kids
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
who have experienced the greatest levels
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
of trauma and behavioral health need
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
with a place to go in their own backyard
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
and so i think the prtf is a huge lift
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
we've set a very bold target of having
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
this up and running in 180 days we have
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
nearly daily meetings to work on the
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
planning and implementation of this but
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's both a challenge and it's going to
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
fit some of that critical need that
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
right now we have no other way to meet
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
um in this state
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and before you get
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
into the growth section any committee
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
members did this stimulate questions
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt thank you
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
um i was going to ask you if willpath
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
had committed to a date to open the ptrf
 
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.470 align:start position:0%
had committed to a date to open the ptrf
but

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.350 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
since you said 180 days it doesn't sound
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
like a commitment but a target
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
but how many beds
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it's 12 bed facility thank you
 
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.510 align:start position:0%
yeah it's 12 bed facility thank you
yeah

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
well it's on the same hempstead
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
we we authorized i think eight or nine
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
positions financial positions where are
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
you on filling those
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
so there were a total of 21
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
classified positions that include a lot
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
of finance staff since the state retains
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility for
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
for those finance functions
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
i believe eight out of the nine are
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
filled as of now because we primarily
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
are training on those existing workforce
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
business office functions that had been
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
working at hampstead currently
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
we also have a number of um
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
non-classified right now unclassified
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
positions which you may be thinking of
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
on a management level if you'd like me
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
to briefly speak to those
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so that's there are a total of
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
six positions um at a management level
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
i've mentioned one of them which is the
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
ceo kathy collins we've also um are
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
extending offers this week for highly
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%

we have extended an offer to a
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
a real star at hampstead as our chief
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
compliance officer and we continue to

manager so we're well on our way to
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
filling out that
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
bench of individuals who will be located
 
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.950 align:start position:0%
bench of individuals who will be located
on-site

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
on-site
 
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.310 align:start position:0%
on-site
managing

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
managing
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
providing the oversight the day-to-day
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
operational um
 
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh leadership but they're also dhhs
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
employees so we're working hand in glove
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
with them on
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
on making sure that we're fitting within
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
the chief legal officer
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
caught my ear and that is i i think the
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
department has
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
legal officers and you rely on doj
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
could you just the the
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
little snippet
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
of what justifies um its own dedicated
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
position over at hampstead yeah so
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
we felt and in particular melissa saint
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
cyr our chief legal officer who's wasn't
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
able to be here today
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
that there's a key need to have that
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
level of um
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
both regulatory oversight to make sure
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we are in compliance with all state
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
federal laws i mean it's just it's
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of requirements that we
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
want to hold hampstead to beyond just
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
checking the box on their regular um
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
accreditations we want to make sure that
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're ahead of the game when it comes to
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
all of that the other piece to remember
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
is that there are certain situations
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
where just like with the adult
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
population we have um
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
involuntary admissions ieas it's a
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
little less frequent on the children's
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
side but it's important that that
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
process is done especially
 
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.990 align:start position:0%
process is done especially
thoughtfully

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
and that requires a a level of um
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
patient right and representation that
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
has to happen within the facility within
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
key time frames and so that the chief
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
legal officer will play a key role with
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
those ieas
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's great i'd be tempted to put and
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
compliance officer in that title but uh
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's just a thought
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
and uh we threw you off of what you were
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
planning on i think we've actually
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
through your questions been able to
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
honestly touch on um many of the key
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
points i was going to make around the
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
prtf and around the management team
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
um i think i want to you know in terms
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
of challenges the the workforce
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
challenges are ones that we are um we
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
are facing head on and and want to be
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
really forward thinking about and so i
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
just want to acknowledge
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things that recovery
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
solutions brings is a national skill set
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
in reach when it comes to
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
helping modernize our approaches at
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
bringing in talented staff including
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
from out of state and so we are working
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
with them even this morning we had a
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
meeting about how we're going to do job
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
fairs and approach recruitment and
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
retention in some innovative ways to
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're drawing upon the
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
best possible workforce at a challenging
 
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
best possible workforce at a challenging
time

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
um i think other than that we've covered
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
i wanted to update you on the management
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
structure which
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
which we're able to do through the
 
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.789 align:start position:0%
which we're able to do through the
questions

00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
and um i think the last part that i will
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
mention is that in addition to a very
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive process of reviewing
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
quality indicators and reporting
 
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
quality indicators and reporting
requirements

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
if you've glanced at the 100
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
plus page contract a great deal of it is
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
expectations we have for ensuring
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
high quality services
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're also trying to be ahead of the
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
game when it comes to thinking about the
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
strategy beyond these two years right so
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
the well path contract is for two years
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
but our plans and our needs around
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
hampstead are are
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
we're really thinking decades into the
 
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.350 align:start position:0%
we're really thinking decades into the
future

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
um in order to undertake a meaningful
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
procurement process beyond those two
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
years we have opted to do what's called
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
an rfi a request for information process
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
shortly an rfi will be released and what
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
that'll allow advocates providers um key
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to do is to help advise the
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
department on what we need to be
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
thinking about strategically as we set
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
up this procurement for the decades
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
ahead so you know what are some of the
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
ways that we need to think about quality
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to think about access that
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
we need to ensure that we're
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
coordinating with community-based
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
services and that way we can structure a
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
contract structure and rfp that really
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
reflects what the state needs so we're
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
pretty excited about that process and um
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so you uh the public can expect to
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
see that rfi released in the next few
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
weeks and that's i think that covers it
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of updates
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
very nice i um i just want to tell you a
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
little bit more why i would be tempted
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
to throw the and compliance into the job
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
title and
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
twice i've worked in
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
legal offices at eastman kodak and
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
at phillips medical systems and one of
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
the things that
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
i learned as a privacy officer
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for compliance
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
was that the legal culture was very much
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
about waiting for people to bring them
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
problems and they they were set up as
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
kind of a billable hours you you bring
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
to me your issue and i'll i'll work it
 
00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.430 align:start position:0%
to me your issue and i'll i'll work it
out

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
i think a compliance officer
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
really needs to be
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
more proactive and walking around
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
where the work is getting done and
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
helping actively educate and i think
 
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.710 align:start position:0%
helping actively educate and i think
that

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
a good compliance culture is sort of
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
distinct from a standard legal culture
 
00:24:57.919 --> 00:24:58.630 align:start position:0%
distinct from a standard legal culture
and

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
you know anything we can do to just make
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone realizes that
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know we need we i i think i've heard
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
you we want to be proactive right and we
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
do have a cheap compliance officer
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
position um that has been filled i may
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
have been remiss and failing to mention
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
that so there's the chief legal officer
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
and chief compliance officer recovery
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
solutions also has a um performance
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
improvement risk manager positioned um
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
that will have dotted lines up to the
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
compliance officer so hopefully that
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
fulfills what you're talking about and
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's all in the hampstead roster yeah
 
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.350 align:start position:0%
that's all in the hampstead roster yeah
okay

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.390 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm having a question uh for specificity
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
on the starting point of this
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh resource
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
number one uh indicated with 45 to 55
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
beds right now
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
on any given day depending on patient
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
acuity yes
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
and okay with that being our benchmark
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
what is the wait list at this moment
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday it was six children on the
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
wait list it has um in the last few
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
weeks since the contract took effect it
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes gets closer to the 10 mark but
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
it really hasn't gotten higher than that
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
which is we are our fingers are crossed
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's obviously affected by seasonal
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
fluctuations including the end of the
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
school year and other factors but we are
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
hopeful that thanks to some of the
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
staffing models as well as the fact that
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
the state has helped open one of the
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
closed units at hampstead hospital that
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
have been closed throughout the pandemic
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
that we will continue to see that wait
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
list eventually reach zero
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
um one follow-up question
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh then specific to that and this is
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
looking into the future when the
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
constant battle is the funding being
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
there while we're young so that the
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
service is provided immediately uh do
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
you see the budget uh be proposed for
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
the next biennium
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
being adjusted based on the projected
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
numbers of
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
use for the for the new facility as it
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
now operates
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i i think so i think we're
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
in we're we're monitoring what the
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
current level of demand is as well as
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
working um statewide to really see what
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
are our community mental health center
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
how do we get ahead so we're not just
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
waiting for situations to become acute
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
but what are we seeing we'll probably
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
hear in a minute about our rapid
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
response system in terms of um the
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
crises that are occurring in the
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
community and what um anticipated uh
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
impact that we'll have in terms of the
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
need for that higher level inpatient and
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
residential care so i think as we head
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
into the budget season one of the things
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner and her whole our
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
whole team are dedicated to is is being
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
very transparent about the level of need
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
we have and what the commensurate
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
funding and resources are that will meet
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
that need
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
okay and then one other one one last
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
point then this is a service for our
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
whole state
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's right and in fact um one of the
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
elements of the contract is that it must
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
prioritize beds for new hampshire youth
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
before any out of state youth are
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
considered for inpatient care and then
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
therefore can there be a reasonable
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
expectation we do not need to send our
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
citizens out of state for this service
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's certainly the goal um and and so
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
far we seem to be um
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
we seem to be on a successful track
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
toward that goal um again not only for
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
that inpatient level of care but also
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
for those residential levels of care
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
that we've never previously offered in
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
the state thank you very much
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
i i have followed
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
something you said and represented
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
mcmahon just exposed it again and that
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
is uh in the almost two years that i've
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
been in
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
deep in this
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
there there is a continuous
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
assumption that 100
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
of all children who are needing services
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
must stay in this community-based
 
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.350 align:start position:0%
must stay in this community-based
framework

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
framework
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
and that it is always bad to to move a
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
child out of state to a different
 
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.230 align:start position:0%
child out of state to a different
environment

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
and having once been
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
a kid and knowing other kids
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
it just strikes me as a as a layman that
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
there has got to be a very small group
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
of kids where it's better for them not
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
to be around their community friends for
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
them not to be hanging around the
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
the bad
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
examples that they have in life uh and
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
to get a clean slate where they can get
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
a fresh start somewhere i'm not asking
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
you to answer today
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
but i'd like you to think through this
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
so because i'd really like to just have
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
us all in sync
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
on whether there is ever
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate care
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
to find
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
a change of environment for a kid to
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
really recover without the weight
 
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.470 align:start position:0%
really recover without the weight
of

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
their uh current community
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
the freedom from their current community
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
because some of these are hellholes that
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
these kids are coming from and i don't
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
know that it's always good to keep them
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
in their hellhole but but no answer
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
today i just i would appreciate a
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
conversation around that
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
miss weaver
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
and miss him
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
how frequently given where you're at
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
should we ask you to come back and give
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
us another update i don't want to like
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
beat you you need to be doing your own
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
work but when when might we best have
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
you back
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
i would think that quarterly would be
 
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.070 align:start position:0%
i would think that quarterly would be
appropriate

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay is mr williams still here
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah could you could you make a note for
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
the agenda
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
thank you sir all right unless you have
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
something else for us i think uh
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
ms weaver you're still going to talk to
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
us about other updates i certainly am
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
one of the updates that we're going to
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
talk about is actually in front of you
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's a handout on rapid response at the
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
request of representative edwards um
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you want to go over this
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
at a high level but this is to date
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
january through april of the data on the
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
rapid response access point
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe this is also posted on a
 
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.710 align:start position:0%
and i believe this is also posted on a
website

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
so that i recognize this uh is this in
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
response to my questions about where
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
we're standing with the uh mobile
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh crisis uh response teams correct yeah
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
okay because we we're now
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
if i were to look at this and it was
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
addressing what my questions are it
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
would say how many of those we have
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know what the utilization per
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
team is uh you know this this is all
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
good but it's losing the granularity of
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the response teams
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
we're happy to provide more information
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
about the um the individual teams and
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
and how many responses and their
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
geographic distribution if you'd like
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit more high level
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
showing the the fact that about one in
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
four of those calls to our centralized
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
number are resulting in mobile
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
deployments sure and and we didn't need
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
this today but we needed to start doing
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
this because
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're in our next budget cycle
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
um i think we have currently
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
six funded mobile response teams is that
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct six funded um i'm not
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
sure i i'm not let's say it's some
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
number around six um
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
the division three i know would like to
 
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.149 align:start position:0%
the division three i know would like to
know

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
how effective these spends are because
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
each one of these response teams is
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
really kind of expensive
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
you know i think they're what 500 000 a
 
00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:32.070 align:start position:0%
you know i think they're what 500 000 a
piece

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.950 align:start position:0%
piece
um

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
and and that's and that could be a
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
really great investment but what i'd
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
like to have us start doing is is making
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we're doing a crosswalk
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
between the deployment of these
 
00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
between the deployment of these
uh

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.630 align:start position:0%
uh
teams

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
teams
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
what they cost
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
what value they're adding and and this
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
is this is good data but in order to
 
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.909 align:start position:0%
is this is good data but in order to
know

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
should we make it 10 global response
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
teams and 4 the right number i think
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to need slightly different
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
data right i think it's the right
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
question to be asking and i think in
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
terms of return on investment to connect
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
the two topics of hampstead and how are
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
we um
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
how are these investments upstream
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
preventing that more intensive level of
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
treatment which very quickly can add up
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
to um many thousands of dollars for an
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
impatient stay right and so i think we
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
need to be thinking holistically about
 
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.110 align:start position:0%
need to be thinking holistically about
um

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
about the preventive opportunity here as
 
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
about the preventive opportunity here as
well

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
all right so we're happy we're happy to
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
get used it sounds like you'd like more
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
um granular data on the number of teams
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
and the um and the way the district the
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
deployments are distributed across those
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
geographic regions and teams i i i would
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
and and i think my my drop dead date is
 
00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:45.110 align:start position:0%
and and i think my my drop dead date is
mid-february

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
mid-february
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
so um are there any other
 
00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:48.870 align:start position:0%
so um are there any other
uh

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
i don't mean literally drop to it that's
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the suspense date that
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
i would like to put on
 
00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:57.029 align:start position:0%
i would like to put on
this

00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
earlier is better are there any uh
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
questions about the mobile response
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
teams anyone in the committee
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
more you want to talk to there's
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of data on here did you
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
want to speak to any of it
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
no i think we're happy to answer
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
questions and we'll just note that the
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
rollout of the federal 988 number
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
is important in the sense that all of
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
this work new hampshire has done to
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
establish its crisis system positions us
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
for that national roll out in an
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
important way as we expect
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
awareness of these crisis resources to
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative murphy great thank you
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh just a question you talking about
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
return on investment and
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
as chairman asked how many teams do we
 
00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.349 align:start position:0%
as chairman asked how many teams do we
need

00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
what are the metrics that you can use or
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
do you use to
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
identify the value added with each team
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
i mean is it the decreased number of you
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
know suicides or drug overdoses i mean
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
how do you measure success with these
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
crisis teams
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a great question we um we can
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly there are metrics and we can
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
get those i don't have them in front of
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
me they tend to be more process oriented
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
i think your question is an interesting
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
one which is how do we look at some of
 
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.750 align:start position:0%
one which is how do we look at some of
those

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
those larger population health outcomes
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
suicide in particular is going to be
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
very difficult to measure because while
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's still far too
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
common a
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
a cause of death it is also fortunately
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
a fairly rare and so the n is too small
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
to really often see measurable
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
difference through a single intervention
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
but i think it's it's um it's incumbent
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
on us to be thinking through how we are
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
measuring progress and how we are course
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
correcting when we aren't um
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
achieving that so happy to follow up
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
with some of the process indicators as
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
well as the ways that we're linking this
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
to our larger 10-year mental health plan
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
and our statewide suicide prevention
 
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:44.950 align:start position:0%
and our statewide suicide prevention
plan

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
it might my follow-up to that is really
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
in healthcare it's been often times very
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to measure success i mean
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen that for decades and so i
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the difficulty you may have
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
in doing that
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
but it's still something that we strive
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
to do anyway um
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh representative murphy um
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
because i realize that when i talk about
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
value-added people don't group they may
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
assume that since i have primarily a
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
financial background i'm just worried
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
about dollars i'm not i i'm looking for
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
the type of metrics that you just
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned how are we being uh clinically
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
efficacious in this and then how how are
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
we keeping track of that that's that's a
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
part of the value added knowing what the
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents are and we have to
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
know that but but
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
i'm really looking for the the larger
 
00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:38.390 align:start position:0%
i'm really looking for the the larger
uh

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
concept of value add
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
one one more comment on that with the
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
with the rfi even for hampstead that's
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
what we also need the community and in
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
particular the medical community to help
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
us think about how do we measure even
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
the efficacy of a hospital is it
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
readmissions is it the number of
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
re-engagements back in the community
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
with a therapist or provider so i think
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
these are the questions we're wrestling
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
with not as a sort of intellectual
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
exercise but to get us to some concrete
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
measures that allow us to invest
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
resources the right place
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
in relative to representative edwards
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know previous mention about you know
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
finance it would like to know how this
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
is you know worked
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
you know we all also recognize that
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
investment today does not yield a result
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
a year from now or in the biennium that
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so it's very hard to
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
understand that and i appreciate that so
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your work and efforts in
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
doing that thank you
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
so since this is your your first term
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
and and because there's an ongoing
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
discussion about the role of finance uh
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
after the role of the policy committee
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
what what i've worked out with
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative pearson is
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
that the division iii finance team isn't
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
just looking at the dollars and cents do
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
we have the money
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
of course we have to answer that but i i
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
think uh one of our we have a broader
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility to just make
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
we understand whether or not uh the
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
money that we're investing is uh
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
effective if it's efficient uh you know
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the the programmatics
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
as as well and not just you know the
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
okay continuing on with a couple of the
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
other updates that representative
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
edwards had asked about was our first
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
was our fte uh status in terms of how we
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
reached our have we gone over our cap of
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
three thousand uh to date as of this
 
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.589 align:start position:0%
three thousand uh to date as of this
week

00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
out of about 3200 positions we only have
 
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.109 align:start position:0%
out of about 3200 positions we only have
uh

00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
2563 of them filled which is about a 20
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate which is what we've been
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
operating on for quite some time and i
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
will be honest it's quite challenging so
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
if we can think about all of the
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
programs that we have and the
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and the services that
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're required to run um finding the
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
staff is uh no not unique to hhs but
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
definitely is a pain point for us for
 
00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:12.950 align:start position:0%
definitely is a pain point for us for
sure

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
so so i have a question for that um this
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
was my first year in finance and um i
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
won't i'll admit that i didn't know
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
everything i was doing but uh would you
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
is it is it correct that the
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
400 or 500 vacancies that you have that
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
the the savings on that personnel cost
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
that we did put in the budget that that
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
money is going to make up a
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
good portion of the 50 million dollar
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
laps that i think we also obligated you
 
00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:44.790 align:start position:0%
laps that i think we also obligated you
to

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
correct it is i think it equates to this
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year i think it's about 20
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
million for personnel lapse for this
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and then next year similar
 
00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and then next year similar
so

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's a high lapse in personnel for us
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
but yes that's we've had to give up that
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
money and we'll give it up again for
 
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.630 align:start position:0%
money and we'll give it up again for
fy23

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions before i move to the
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
i i believe you had asked about
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
sysc and spu as well
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
so sysc i think where the legislation
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
has landed with a closure date of
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
march of 23 is definitely challenging
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
for the department i don't think we
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
quite have a
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
a plan yet on what's going to happen
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
with that but we are obligated to move
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
forward with a design we've been working
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
on a design for well over a year we
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
spent all of last summer and fall coming
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
up with that design with stakeholders
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
internal external
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
nationally i had a consultant work with
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
us so we're moving forward to procure an
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
architect somebody to help us with that
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
design would look like
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
and right now we're in the process of
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get that submitted through the
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
proper channels so
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh so so let me give you a legislative
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
update on that
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
i've been talking to
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
senator daniels and a few other people
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
to say okay we officially have no plan
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
the legislature didn't help you um and
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
so because a judge could look at this 31
 
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.630 align:start position:0%
so because a judge could look at this 31
march

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
closure date as a as you have to evict
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
everyone on the 1st of april if if
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature gives you other
 
00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:25.270 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature gives you other
authority

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
the simple thing that we think we're
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to try to rush through
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
at the beginning and next term
 
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.270 align:start position:0%
at the beginning and next term
is

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
at least a one-year extension
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
so that we don't run into a
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
judicial order to empty the facility
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
that would definitely be uh
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to us reaching the goal of
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
having a different facility in a
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
different location okay now
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have to submit to drafting
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
until i don't know september i think so
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
if you could just think about
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
how much time is the right amount of
 
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.030 align:start position:0%
how much time is the right amount of
time

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
knowing that it would be
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
easy to say well let's make it three
 
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.630 align:start position:0%
easy to say well let's make it three
years

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.750 align:start position:0%
years
but

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature is would probably not
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
accept that because there's always this
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
paranoia that you guys aren't really
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
wanting to close it and i i can't
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
explain why that is but
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
it is kind of the
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
boundary condition that people want to
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
keep it shorter if they can to make sure
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we're still moving forward
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
aggressively sure i understand that i
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
will say that the department is fully
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
committed to creating a facility that
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of that population and
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
that is different from how it stands
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
today which is why we're moving forward
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
with our design because we believe we
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
have what that model is and what it
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
should look like so thank you great
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing you asked about was the
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
psychiatric forensic hospital
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to give you an update brief
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
update that
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
project is on target we are working with
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
smrt which is an architect firm
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
we actually have another public
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
information session next thursday night
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
june 30th at six o'clock we've held
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
about three of these already
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
open to anyone that wants to attend in
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
particular the abutters on the property
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
of sap's campus
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
as well we have the
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
city assistant city manager as part of
 
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.270 align:start position:0%
city assistant city manager as part of
our

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
steering committee for that design
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
as well as other folks in nami is also a
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
partner with us in that project so we
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
are on track
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
we are looking to procure a contractor
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
for to start the build uh this fall and
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
then anticipating that construction
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
would start in early 23
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
and be completed by 24.
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
so if you are interested in looking at
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
those designs the plans any of the
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
minute meetings on the department's
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
so at this point without giving any
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
procurement or other business sensitive
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
information away
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
what's your sense of the likelihood that
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
the new facility will be in concord
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
the new facility will be in concord it
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
attached to new hampshire hospital
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
so it it is that part has been
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
determined so they are the design is
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
actually an addition to and taking up
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
one of the parking lots at new hampshire
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
hospital so although we'll have one
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
entrance it will be two separate
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh facilities once you get inside so i
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
understand that and that and i think
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's probably a good decision i'm just
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
curious when was that decision finalized
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
says it been months weeks
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's been months i think before we
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
procured the architect
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
we had that decision
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
made i think it was
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
what are we in june last year i believe
 
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.150 align:start position:0%
what are we in june last year i believe
okay

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
i know for sunday new center obviously
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
we don't have a location that is to be
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
determined okay thank you i i had missed
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
that decision so thank you
 
00:45:02.839 --> 00:45:04.790 align:start position:0%
that decision so thank you
sure

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
um if you leave for my updates that's
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
what i had for you today
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay that's great does anyone have
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
anything random for the go ahead uh
 
00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:15.270 align:start position:0%
anything random for the go ahead uh
senator

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
the dental bill hasn't been signed yet
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
but it will be
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if on the next
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
few meetings we because the timing is so
 
00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:31.190 align:start position:0%
few meetings we because the timing is so
tight

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
tight
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
um in order
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
to have the benefit
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
in place by next spring whether we can
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
ask the department to just update us
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
regularly on
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
the waiver and the state plan amendments
 
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.790 align:start position:0%
the waiver and the state plan amendments
and

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a great great ask and i
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
already saw mr williams saying yes and
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
he's sort of the keeper of the agenda so
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
the odds just went up
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
um it's jim
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative mcmahon to follow up on
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
on the senator's question there um
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
can with the guidance of our
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner and ms han
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.309 align:start position:0%
what is the
uh

00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
oversight that's required to stay front
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
and center with the with the authorities
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
having jurisdiction in washington that
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
the dental plan that's correct yes yes
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
um i'd have to get back to you on that i
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't have that
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
answer and and i said in the context and
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
just what i've learned over 20 years
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
that there's a benign harassment you
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
have to put in function to do this with
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
manners of course uh but it's this is
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
something from the legislative side that
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
we could assist with
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
in in that regard and so it's
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
and just as a chair it's indicated you
 
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.150 align:start position:0%
and just as a chair it's indicated you
have

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
multiple silos that you you both your
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
professionals are dealing with is that i
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
would like to be one of those people you
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
can call on to follow up and and work
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
with the senator to ensure that this
 
00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:04.150 align:start position:0%
with the senator to ensure that this
happens

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
so that the the faceless bureaucrats
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
which we'll know i'll never see but i'm
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
making these decisions uh that we're
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
front and center and then we have our
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
next meeting we have an up to date
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
saying something is actually happening
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
versus we're still waiting for something
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to see what you got
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
specifically my question is what can we
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
do to assist in that regard thank you i
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
will we will let you know absolutely and
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
if you put a timeline on that when will
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
you let me know
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
my next meeting
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
i can let you know sooner it's up to you
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh sooner is always better so i can be
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
intellectually prepared to yeah yeah the
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
next meeting we haven't talked about it
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
yet but it's looking like 23 september
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
which would be beyond our ols drop date
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think if we're going to do anything to
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
help in legislation we need to know
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
sooner but sure within the next week or
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
so does that work for you
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow would work yeah yeah but oh
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
really yeah i think that the individual
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
i need to connect with is on vacation so
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
i just uh
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
so if that individual's doctor sarah
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
finney let me just say what she's been
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
briefing us on representative mcmahon
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
yes sir um
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
so she's known that this program will
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
require two waivers
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
and she says that she's uh has actively
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
engaged the folks at cms
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
and that they understand the waivers and
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
and everything that they've said has
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
been a positive that they will approve
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
the waivers but saying you'll approve
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
the waiver and having a
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
waiver approval is two different things
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
so so your your question is is is
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
very relevant um but the um there's
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
reason for optimism
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
good and appreciate that additional
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
information for that optimism just to
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
show that we're on the same page with
 
00:48:54.319 --> 00:48:55.270 align:start position:0%
show that we're on the same page with
you

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
and if there's something further that
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
can be done i
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
just like to offer that
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
offer as much as i can to be there for
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there any other community
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
mountain commissioner you got anything
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
else you want to tell us why you're
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
while you're here i think we've taken up
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of time already i thank you for
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
the time to give all the updates i think
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's been very valuable i know i've
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
found it useful
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
so so thank you um next up we'll have
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
a discussion on hb 1290 establishing a
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
task force on precision medicine i
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%

volume of waste paper coming out of this
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
building is flying and therefore in the
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
attempted solution
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%

which describes the progress of the
 
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.510 align:start position:0%
which describes the progress of the
temporary

00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:44.630 align:start position:0%
look at it late in the evening
about

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
this is i hope the final report
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.109 align:start position:0%
of the
interim

00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
interim
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
task force on precision medicine
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
those of you who have watched the
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
process of this
 
00:51:06.319 --> 00:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
process of this
effort

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
know that it is a memorial uh to
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative kathy rogers whom we lost
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
this last year it is based on uh her
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
submitted bill hb 1290 calling for
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
legislative action in the area of what
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
is known as precision medicine what you
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh have in this document
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
in the uh first four pages is uh what
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
our serving chairman has called
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
the corporals report
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
summary uh four-page summary of
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
the efforts of the interim task force
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
and following that
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
from pages 5 through 11
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
are the generals report
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
and this is the appendix with all of the
 
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.870 align:start position:0%
and this is the appendix with all of the
details

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
details
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
that get fairly technical
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
beginning on page 11
 
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.430 align:start position:0%
beginning on page 11
is

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
the most recent statement of pages 11-13
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
and these are the transition documents
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
to move this effort from
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
the interim task force to a standing
 
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.549 align:start position:0%
the interim task force to a standing
subcommittee

00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
health and human services oversight
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
basically i was asked to uh prepare
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh some contacts and some directives
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
based on the charge to the committee
 
00:52:41.119 --> 00:52:42.069 align:start position:0%
based on the charge to the committee
um

00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
here in this transition document
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
beginning on page 11. again uh it is for
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
those of you who suffer from insomnia
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh i need to point out
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh just a couple of
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
minor points and then i'll be done
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
i have had a bias in preparing this
 
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.990 align:start position:0%
i have had a bias in preparing this
document

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.870 align:start position:0%
document
the

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
bias is that it is pitched
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
particular toward oncology it's pitched
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
toward cancer
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
i believe that people in search of
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
precision medicine solutions
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
most often most
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
frequently are people who are dealing
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
with issues of cancer
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
and as a result this is an effort to put
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
the standing
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee in contact with people who
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
can speak authoritatively
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
to the issue of cancer
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
mr rollo that is
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the new hampshire
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
cancer society
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
the people that i've recruited are top
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
flight researchers they are clinicians
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh a caveat that
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of including oncologists
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
included with clinical expertise is not
 
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.270 align:start position:0%
included with clinical expertise is not
to

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
give us direction in terms of policy
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
decisions it's to orient the standing
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee to what the issues are that
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
patients face
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
in looking for precision medicine
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
solutions to diagnosis of cancer
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
i apologize for that bias
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
the other comment that i wish to make is
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
that there is uh
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
toward the end of this document
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
it's really on page 13.
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
there is a last statement on creating
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
and maintaining quality services
 
00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:49.910 align:start position:0%
and maintaining quality services
and

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
i will speak as cautiously as i can for
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
the record
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
in my own
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
communication with
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
oncologists in particular
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
it has come to my attention that there
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
are numbers of entrepreneurial
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
organizations that are moving into the
 
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.109 align:start position:0%
organizations that are moving into the
area

00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
of precision medicine what we can call
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
generally precision medicine
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
and they are offering patients
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
new means of diagnosis and therapy
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
traditional oncologists occasionally
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
have doubts about the efficacy of these
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
organizations but point out that they
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
can be highly profitable
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
and as a result they become a magnet
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
for entrepreneurship often with funding
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
that comes from
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh sources that are less than
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
normal uh they often involve foreign
 
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.030 align:start position:0%
normal uh they often involve foreign
investment

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
investment
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh often involve uh investment by people
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
who are much more interested in
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
profitability rather than quality
 
00:55:57.599 --> 00:55:58.710 align:start position:0%
profitability rather than quality
assurance

00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
assurance
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
so as a result of that um i did do some
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
research i was able to identify
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
someone who has worked with such an
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
organization in new hampshire who no
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
longer works for that organization
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
and who doesn't wish at this point to be
 
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.829 align:start position:0%
and who doesn't wish at this point to be
identified

00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
inasmuch as that person has become a
 
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.430 align:start position:0%
inasmuch as that person has become a
whistleblower

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
whistleblower
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
indicating that
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
manipulations of that organization are
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
federal inquiry so
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
as the task force gets appointed and as
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
they are looking for information in that
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
particular area of quality assurance
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
i may be able to
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
recruit the
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
former cfo of that organization to come
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
forward and speak for the record at the
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
moment i regret that i cannot provide a
 
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.710 align:start position:0%
moment i regret that i cannot provide a
name

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.309 align:start position:0%
name
so

00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
i thank you if there are questions i
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be very glad to respond yeah i i
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
have i have a question or two um
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
first you know thank you i i know that
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
this has been a labor of love for you
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
you put a lot of work into it you you've
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
properly honored uh
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
the honorable kathy
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
rogers and i'm really glad that uh that
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
we've done that
 
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
um and we'll continue to do that
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
my my question
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
is as i'm looking at this transition to
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
a standing task force is it your
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
expectation that we establish one
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
through rsa or as i understand it we
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
have used the oversight committee to
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
get an interim
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
canoe into the water so we could at
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
least start going somewhere do you do do
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
you see this as continuing as an
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
extension of the oversight committee or
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
do you see this as a legislative
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
committee i i must say mr chairman i
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
think that the oversight committee
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
operates with such a high level of
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
insight and professionalism
 
00:58:00.799 --> 00:58:01.589 align:start position:0%
insight and professionalism
and

00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to the house of
 
00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.510 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to the house of
representatives

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
our processes in the house are slow
 
00:58:08.799 --> 00:58:10.630 align:start position:0%
our processes in the house are slow
ponderous

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
ponderous
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
and i think this is an area in which i
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
would prefer to see us move uh quickly
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the oversight
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee is probably the best organ for
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
the house to do that
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and i my next
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
question is as i'm looking at the
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
types of skill sets that you're
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
populating this with or recommending
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
population i don't see a retired public
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
health professor from unh i can't think
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
of a single one
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
if you could help us find a unh
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
professor who's familiar with the
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
subject that would be great to have that
 
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:47.990 align:start position:0%
subject that would be great to have that
person

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
continue to be involved
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think i thank
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
which moves us to
 
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.470 align:start position:0%
which moves us to
patricia

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
patricia
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
tricia tilly
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
do you want to come up patricia
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
mrs tilly
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
now now what i i think you're going to
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
talk about is this um
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing effort with a relatively new
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
twist on it on helping
 
00:59:40.799 --> 00:59:41.990 align:start position:0%
twist on it on helping
provide

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
a better access to clinical and mental
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
health services
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
inside the walls of
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
select schools that is correct thank you
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative good morning members of
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.069 align:start position:0%
the committee
so

00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to give a
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
brief update on where we are in
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
providing some school-based health
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
services in the upcoming year i'm going
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
to preface and i'll probably say it a
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
couple more times we are in active
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
recruit active procurement currently so
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
i can talk
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
in a wide way around what our requests
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
for applications were how we got this
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
money into the state but i can't really
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
talk about exactly what's going to
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
happen because that's currently in
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
negotiation so just with that preference
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
i think we can start back
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
in january even last fall where public
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
health was fortunate enough to receive
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
several blocks of money for covid19
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
response in one of those funding sources
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
called our workforce funding sources
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
very long name but we've sort of
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
shortened it to workforce
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
there was an opportunity within there to
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
provide a certain percentage of those
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
funds to support school age health
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
programs or school-based health programs
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
programs for school-aged kids so in
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
january we brought forth a fiscal item
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
to fiscal
 
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
it was number
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
22016. if you want to google that
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
and that authorized us to accept these
 
01:01:09.359 --> 01:01:10.390 align:start position:0%
and that authorized us to accept these
new

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
cdc funds
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
to to provide a whole host of activities
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
um support workforce in our communities
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
in our local two city health departments
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
in our public health networks
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
we we have some community health workers
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
are out in the field funded with those
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
funds and in that also was the
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to support school-based
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
health and that was articulated in the
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal letter
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
back in january
 
01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.309 align:start position:0%
back in january
so

01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
fast forward to april 2022
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
we put forward a request for
 
01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:46.870 align:start position:0%
we put forward a request for
applications

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
to provide school-based health services
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
in communities it's important to note
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
that those requests for applications
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
were limited to our existing um
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
federally qualified health centers and
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
community health centers that currently
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
have a contract with the with the
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
department so we as many of you know we
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
have a network of community health
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
centers in the in the community we
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
provide funding for those um health
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
centers in addition to their medicaid
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
and all of the other federal sources
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
they get public health also provides uh
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
funding for those um
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
those facilities to do work that is you
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
know funded that is not typically funded
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
by medicaid to do a lot of the
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
engagement work some of the
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
transportation and really sort of the
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
glue around those medicaid billable
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
services one of the things that our
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
community health centers have always
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
done is had partnerships with schools
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
to some degree differently in each
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
community they have worked with their
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
schools to ensure that referrals get
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
where they need to be that kids have
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
access to medicaid or commercial health
 
01:02:50.799 --> 01:02:52.069 align:start position:0%
access to medicaid or commercial health
insurance

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
and also to in some cases to provide
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
support to the school nurses so what
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
this rfa did is it provided an
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for additional federal funds
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
for them to do a much more intentional
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
and and robust um partnership to provide
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
both physical health services things
 
01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.789 align:start position:0%
both physical health services things
like

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
physical exams sports exams
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
acute care if needed or desired
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
as well as behavioral health services
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
including anxiety and depression
 
01:03:24.079 --> 01:03:25.750 align:start position:0%
including anxiety and depression
screenings

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
screenings
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
other sort of
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
primary care type services counseling
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
services and crisis intervention all of
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
those are things that were in the scope
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
of services that health centers could
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
respond to if that was something that
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
they would be interested in doing and
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
that they had a relationship with a
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
school to do that with so we are in that
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
procurement process now i can tell you
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
we've received
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
applicants we are going through the
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
negotiations at this time it's important
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
to note that um the selected applicants
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh needed to acknowledge that they had
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
to have parental permission of course or
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
caregiver permission before any services
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
were ever rendered to any uh student or
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
youth um that goes without saying but it
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
was said within the context of our
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
contract what we will do as part of our
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring process we will approve
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
all of the policies around how they will
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
engage and get parental permission
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
before treating any student
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
we will monitor we will approve that
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
policy once um once the contract is put
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
in place and then what we will also do
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
as part of our monitoring is we will go
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
and do probably an audit a very you know
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
an audit with a lower case a audit
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
through a site visit as we do check
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
other as we always check if they're in
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
compliance with our scope of services so
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
we will do that once the project is up
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
and running we're very excited about
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to provide a little bit
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
more resources to schools i think all of
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
us have acknowledged and seen the need
 
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.309 align:start position:0%
us have acknowledged and seen the need
for

01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
both physical health and behavioral
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
health services in this population
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
we know that several many parents are
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
interested in ensuring that their kids
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
can get care at school it is far more
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
convenient you don't have loss of school
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
time in the same way i mean i can
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
remember as a kid being thrilled when
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
you had a doctor's appointment because
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
you basically got the day off and maybe
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
some ice cream
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
this you know allows
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
a much more convenient opportunity for
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
parents to make sure that there's
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
consistent care for their kids
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
folks don't have to take time off of
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
work again it is all voluntary it is all
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
in with parental permission um but we're
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
there really to be a resourceful to the
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
families and quite frankly to the school
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
nurse and and the administration who
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
have really um acknowledged that they
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
need those sorts of support so i'm happy
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions right now again
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
very big picture a little bit vague
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you for that and i i want to
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you it's been what three or four
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
weeks since you allowed me in your
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
office to talk about some of this so i i
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate your transparency hey um
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
so on the
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
notion of parental approval
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
i i believe what you're saying is that
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
the parents will opt in
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
before the very first exam takes place
 
01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
before the very first exam takes place
correct

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay will that opt-in
 
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.670 align:start position:0%
okay will that opt-in
be

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
case-based or will it be episodic
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
and and because i'm probably making
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
terms up here
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
case-based to me is a
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
kid has a condition
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
parents say go ahead and treat that
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
condition and if it's three or four or
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
five meetings it's it's all covered
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
under that one opt in
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
versus episodic
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
each instance before the the patient the
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
student is seen
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
is that going to trigger its own opt-in
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question so this
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
is where we're really going to need to
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
look to the policy of the healthcare
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
provider you know they have the
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
experience in how to provide ensure that
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
there is um parental permission
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
much in the way that if you sent your
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
high school student right now to the
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
doctor's office you know how how would
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
they ensure that they have parental
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
permission for that so i'm going to
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
hedge a little bit and say we will look
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
to the policy of the health care
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
provider who will be doing that
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
and approve that policy ensure that it
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
makes sense for that um
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
for within the context of that school
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh so so thank you for that and you know
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
from our other conversation that my
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
concern is there's uh this group of
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
agitated involved citizens that are
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
worried about the relationship with
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
government uh and particularly when it
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
comes to schools and mental health of
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
their kids and i just think that uh
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
an easier way to sell this to the entire
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is if we had an
 
01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.150 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is if we had an
episodic

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
episodic
 
01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
episodic
opt-in

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh and i would uh and i would suggest
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
because you know let me you know maybe
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
that won't always be the case but uh
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
like a two-year
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
phase out do episodic for two years and
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
then you know transition to case base if
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
if necessary it's
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
again i'm just brainstorming and it's up
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
to you guys to run the program i'm i'm
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
just telling you what it's easier to
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
sell thank you all right
 
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.470 align:start position:0%
sell thank you all right
yes

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt thank you
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
so if a
 
01:08:36.159 --> 01:08:37.669 align:start position:0%
so if a
student

01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:38.789 align:start position:0%
student
is

01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
experiencing a mental health crisis
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
yes suicidal or something
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
there would still be a need to get
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
parental permission first
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that that'd be a different we're
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
calling the crisis right so thank you
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question senator so
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is where i'd want to really go to
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
the policies of the health care provider
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
to see what and what how they will
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
inform families ahead of time we
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
certainly um know right now you know if
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
you think about it the school nurse you
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
know the school nurse often calls
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
parents and says can i give your child a
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
tylenol i would anticipate something
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
like that if there were not already if
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
that child would not already receiving
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing treatment whether counseling or
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
other services
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the school nurse or the healthcare
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
provider would pick up the phone and
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that the parent was aware of the
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
services their child was
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
receiving i i i think i agree with your
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
premise there as i understand it senator
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
is that if it's a
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
emergent care if it's a suicide attempt
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's like any healthcare emergency you
 
01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:49.669 align:start position:0%
it's like any healthcare emergency you
gotta

01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
gotta
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
act but but still you have to inform so
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
that'll be interesting how they take
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
care of that
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
um i have two other questions i don't
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
know if we rehearse these
 
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.750 align:start position:0%
know if we rehearse these
um

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
one is
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think we'd like to be able to talk
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
about how this program will affect
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
school-based property taxes
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
with the additional care some of that
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
care may be reimbursable by medicaid and
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
other insurance carriers
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
where where will that revenue go will it
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
stay strictly within the healthcare
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
provider that we're contracting with or
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
will there be some payout to
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
so that they may mitigate some of their
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
school taxes you know i think this is
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
part of the relationship we're asking
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
those health care providers to develop a
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
relationship with their schools we will
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
not dictate that you know i think it is
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate to consider that if a
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider is providing a
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
service they will be able to re get
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for that through
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
commercial or um
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
or public insured through medicaid that
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
i think that is appropriate um but the
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare part the healthcare center
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
and the school are going to negotiate
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
their relationship these funds is really
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
just get the program up and running
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
really the glue to stick that together
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
whether you need an exam table in a
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
particular room or just even the
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
outreach that's going to be involved
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
with that we know that there are a lot
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
of startup costs and that's what these
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay so my next question it's a hot
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
topic uh in the news and and that is uh
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
the senate apparently uh passed some
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
type of red flags legislation in their
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
bill yesterday i i don't know what's in
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
there i don't know the extent it's going
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
to be mandatory in new hampshire um but
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
um but what i am curious about is
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
assuming that that there is no red flag
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
law a new hampshire-based one or a
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
us-based one
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
if a mental health provider is
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
counseling a student and perceives that
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
that student
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
is a threat to others i mean obviously
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're worried about suicide threat to
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
self but but if uh if there's a
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
perception that that student is a is a
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
threat to others
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
or there already existing laws that
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
would allow that mental health provider
 
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.390 align:start position:0%
would allow that mental health provider
to

01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
flag that student to say that we have a
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
potential risk and we need additional
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
services here
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question and i
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
must admit that that's about 10 feet
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
outside of my uh my expertise but what i
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
can say is that certainly existing ferpa
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
laws we know that there are privacy laws
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
within schools that need to be abided by
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
as well as our any mental health
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
practitioner is going to work within
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
their licensure and within their um
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
ethics and the policies of their health
 
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.830 align:start position:0%
ethics and the policies of their health
care

01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
system so you know i anticipate they
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
will work fully within the context of of
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
whatever laws are on the books today or
 
01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
whatever laws are on the books today or
tomorrow

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to offer what
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative mcmahon offered earlier
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
as a as a guy who fed my family with
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
privacy law issues i i'm interested in
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
the privacy aspect of this but
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
but if um if as if you had
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
in parallel
 
01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.950 align:start position:0%
in parallel
uh

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
a conduct of
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a legal inquiry into what a red
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
flag like
 
01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.310 align:start position:0%
flag like
notification

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
notification
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
would look like and what sort of
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
legislative changes
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
might be needed
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
i would consider
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
sponsoring something like that and with
 
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.310 align:start position:0%
sponsoring something like that and with
this

01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
september ols date thank you okay and
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
maybe mr williams will help he knows a
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
little so all right thank you
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from miss
 
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from miss
tilly

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
just before you go it it's my
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that existing law would
 
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.070 align:start position:0%
understanding that existing law would
allow

01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
any provider in the school in fact would
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
require any provider in the school
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
to uh seek uh uh
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
intervention on behalf of somebody who's
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
a threat to others including uh
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency hospitalization am
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
i correct about that thank you thank you
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
so i like the answer you gave
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative marsh i was trying to
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
look for the same answer how
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
what what why did you answer him and not
 
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.630 align:start position:0%
what what why did you answer him and not
me

01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
um because i didn't want to misspeak to
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
some of those parameters right there but
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that we are in line with what
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
um representative marsh noted
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's great um all right thank you
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
i think she just likes you more bill
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%

specificity of my question okay thank
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%

01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
update on the developmental disabilities
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%

so we'll get started for those of you
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
that may not be familiar with the dd and
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
the abd waivers these waivers are 1915 c
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
waivers that allow us to provide
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
supports to individuals in the community
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
and we call them a waiver because it is
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
a service that is an alternative to an
 
01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.630 align:start position:0%
a service that is an alternative to an
institutional

01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
institutional
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
care so we are waiving institutional
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
care for home and community-based
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
services i'm going to start with an
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
update on our dd waiver
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
and our data is as of april 13th we do
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
these reports quarterly and we did not
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
have our report last month because the
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee accommodated my being out so
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for doing that
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
so as of april 13th we had 723
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
individuals that were funded on the
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
waiver through quarters one through four
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
and our
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
the people that are funded are broken
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
down by different categories and
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
category a are people that
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
are exiting the school district
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
and receiving adult services category b
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
are people that are new to our services
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
and c are people that are currently
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
receiving services but
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
accessing new services so out of those
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
723 people
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
we had the majority of them
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
were people receiving services currently
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
the c category 64
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
we had 31 a's
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the developmental disabilities
 
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.430 align:start position:0%
so that's the developmental disabilities
waiver

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
i'm moving over to the in-home support
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
waiver next which is children with
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and as of
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
april 13th
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
we had funded 58 people
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
through quarters one through four
 
01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:23.350 align:start position:0%
through quarters one through four
and

01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
eighty-nine percent were new to services
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
and eleven percent received enhanced
 
01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.950 align:start position:0%
and eleven percent received enhanced
services

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
and for the acquired brain disorder
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
weaver as of april 13th we had 33 people
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
that were funded through quarters one
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
through four
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
and six of those folks were new to
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
services and 27 of them
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
were going to receive enhanced services
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
so those were all funded through the
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
four quarters and again that was as of
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
april 13th we're very close to the end
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year so in our next report
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to give a full annual
 
01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.830 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to give a full annual
report

01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
and that's my update any questions i i
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
have a brainstorm for you this this may
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
be ridiculous and you're you're allowed
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
to tell me that
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
if you were here earlier you maybe
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
picked up on the idea that the mobile
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
response teams
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh are of interest
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
and i know that they have some staffing
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
if it happens that we were to look at
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
the data of a mobile response team and
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
found that it's
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
appears underutilized to the
 
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.709 align:start position:0%
appears underutilized to the
professionals

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
is it possible that they could be used
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
to supplement
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
dd services that that
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to get provided or is
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
the skill mix and the mobile response
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
team so fundamentally different that's a
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
just a non-starter
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
i don't i mean i i would have to look at
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
the function of the mobile response team
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
and see exactly what they're responding
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
to so if it's a crisis situation i think
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
anyone anybody anybody would benefit
 
01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.709 align:start position:0%
anyone anybody anybody would benefit
from

01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
services provided from an emergency
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
response team if they're in crisis but
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
we also have to look at the population
 
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
and how we would fund it and chris can
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
probably wait sure thank you for thank
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
you for that question um and so
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
really what the services sandy's talking
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
about are day services some residential
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
supports services to
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
help somebody work
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
participate in community activities so
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
the skill set would be different if
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
somebody was also receiving
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
developmental services and mental health
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
services and were in need of crisis
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
response that they would partner in that
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
way but i wouldn't
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
switch it up that way
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative murphy
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
update my question is i'm assuming that
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
it may be wrongly so that the acquired
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh disorders are more of the
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
older population that you serve
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
and as opposed to those that are
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
required in youth in my question is
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
for these people at home and for their
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
services how
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
long do you help them i mean to what age
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
group i mean is this go on and on and on
 
01:20:12.239 --> 01:20:13.110 align:start position:0%
group i mean is this go on and on and on
or

01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
what is the age span in which you take
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
care of the acquired uh
 
01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:20.709 align:start position:0%
care of the acquired uh
disorders

01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that question um we
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
so this is long-term supports and
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
services so we serve people all the way
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
through death
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
and your point about acquired
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities is a good point because it
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
really distinguishes which population
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
people fall into
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
so if you have a brain injury under the
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
age of 22 it affects your developmental
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
process and so that's considered a
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
developmental disability
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
if you have a brain injury at the age of
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
30 however it's considered an acquired
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
brain disorder so those are two
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
different populations with two different
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
approaches to treatment
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
so if i may fall
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
i was once involved in a lot of trauma
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
and so i saw a lot of kids but also
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
adults involved in motor vehicle
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
accidents whatever
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
and so i wasn't aware that there was an
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
age distinction between
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
the the services option other different
 
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
services for those acquired at age say
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
20 in a motorcycle versus somebody
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
that's you know
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
30 on a roof and falls off you know it
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
what are the differences in services i'm
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand what you think
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
the services range in in intensity so
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
there are people that need very minimal
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
services they might need a couple of
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
hours a week for support in their home
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
and there are people that may need
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
24-hour care because they have total
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
care needs so what we do is we look at
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
the individual needs and then
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
build services around them and we have
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
providers in the community that do that
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
and we have 10 area agencies that also
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
um are responsible for services in their
 
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.709 align:start position:0%
um are responsible for services in their
regions

01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
regions
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
and just a quick follow-up do you have
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
on your staff these providers or do you
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
contract with say physical therapy
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists you know rehab
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
specialists you know are these on your
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
staff or these people you contract
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
directly with typically their contract
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
oh yes thank you mr chairman
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're very close to the end of the
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
or can you get back to us with
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
how much of your appropriation for these
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
waiver programs
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
has been spent um
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
to provide services and
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
money left over does it last now or stay
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
in the program and lapse next year or
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
so the money will carry over if there's
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
unspent money
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
forever it does not lapse ever yes it
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
will move into the next year and we we
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
can get you that information as well
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
do you know one hand not often today no
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
so so i think that the specific question
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
is at the end of this two-year budget
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
year do your monies lapse and that would
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
have been put into the budget whether
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
they lapsed or not so you're you
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
specifically know these are non-lapsing
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
jim

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
jim
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.310 align:start position:0%
uh yes
yes

01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'm madam if i may uh just a
 
01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.590 align:start position:0%
i'm madam if i may uh just a
clarification

01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh for myself is um
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
since we have zero just looking at the
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
list that was provided to us says zero
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
on the wait list
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
in in uh going for uh going forward
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
is there a rate of pay adjustment on the
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
plan to encourage and ensure that
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
the needs of new hampshire are met
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
a rate of play pay attention yeah yeah
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
i'll clarify that that was an issue over
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
the last number of years um richard pay
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
people just weren't staying with the job
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
so if they came on they didn't last long
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
because of just the uh the pay would say
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
because like 15 and then was uh
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
negotiating with the kremlin to give it
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
to anything worthwhile
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
and to keep them and uh
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
that being said is what is
 
01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
part of your
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
prognostications for the future planning
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
with the but with the budget to come
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
relative to the uh rate of pay to
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
to um when you advertise for more more
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
folks that will need to meet the the
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
waitlist requirements not talking about
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
the expertise within that individual but
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's just to have people available that
 
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:33.830 align:start position:0%
it's just to have people available that
will

01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
will want to take these jobs because
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
they can make a living doing it yes so
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
as as with all of our
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
service delivery systems across the
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
state we are experiencing a significant
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage that was only
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
exasperated by the pandemic
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we are currently as a system looking
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
at our rate methodology to um really
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the opportunity to
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
build into our rate methodology some
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
incentive incentivization for providers
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
around building workforce
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
capacity and
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
and really incentivizing those providers
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
to have some kind of a credentialing
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
option for direct support professionals
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
in our system
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
so there is oh i'm sorry oh no go ahead
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
is that still truly the 10 area agencies
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
so the yes the 10 area agencies are the
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
server they are responsible for services
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
within their regions and what we're
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
looking at as a system is a rate
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
methodology to determine rates for
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
individuals based on those individuals
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
needs so the hope is that that approach
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
to rate development will be consistent
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
across our state which would be the ten
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
area agencies as well
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay this is a faulty memory question i
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think the legislature in the last
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
couple of months tried to fix
 
01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.030 align:start position:0%
couple of months tried to fix
the

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
five percent commitment that we had made
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
in the budget to up
 
01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.910 align:start position:0%
in the budget to up
contract

01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
values by five percent in the hopes that
 
01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.350 align:start position:0%
values by five percent in the hopes that
the

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the contractors would pass that
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
money on to the workforce and and like i
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
said this is probably a memory problem
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead no it's not it's not a memory
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
problem so what we had is we had the
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
home and community-based fmap dollars
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what you're referring
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
to because we brought that to fiscal
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
and so that is one-time money that was
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
passed on to the provider agencies
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
and it's really meant to enhance their
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
workforce the challenge with that from a
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
provider's perspective is it's one-time
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
money right and so a provider can't
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
increase somebody's rate of pay unless
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
they know they have a way to continue
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
that rate of pay um so
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's helping a little bit with
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention but we really
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
do need to look at the rates long term
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
it's helping with recruiting and
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
retention because i assume that they're
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
turning those monies into bonuses
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
potentially that's what they could be
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt thank you i i believe
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of the nursing home rate
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
where we we did account for our
 
01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.790 align:start position:0%
where we we did account for our
budget

01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
miscalculation and the governor has
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
signed that bill okay well thank you for
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
that uh i i know that when we first in
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
the budget cycle started to put a 5 in
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
for a targeted
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
medical service that that opened the
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
doors and everyone wanted the same five
 
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
percent we ended up giving that five
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
percent out a lot so
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh more than the initial target and and
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
so i just was curious
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
and and that's all right um
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's i i don't need people to fix my
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
memory too much but we did have 6.2
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
percent of medicaid provider rate
 
01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.790 align:start position:0%
percent of medicaid provider rate
increases

01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
increases
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
that went into effect in
 
01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.110 align:start position:0%
that went into effect in
2019

01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is why you're the senator and i'm
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
still just a representative i think
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
um okay so um
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
on the graph
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
i i i just i'm looking for a key
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
that tells me what black means and what
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
blue means
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
black is quarterly
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
quarters right um i have to
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
sorry i
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
believe that black is quarterly
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
reporters i believe it now that you've
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
i think the first time we had this
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
conversation was maybe eight or nine
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
months ago where
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
the aha moment was that you guys can
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
dole out
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
or appropriate or or encumber
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
the money
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
so that we're reporting a zero wait list
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
but there's still the reality
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
patients needing care that aren't
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
getting care because that money hasn't
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
worked its way all the way through the
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
system to where
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
the people are providing the care
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
are actually acting and getting the
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
numbers down is is is that still true
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
and is that not on this graph right
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
that's true and so we have been tracking
 
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
those numbers and what we've heard from
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
agencies mainly is that the challenge
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
with getting services started which is
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
about 28
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
right now for the dd waiver
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of people that have received
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
services but have not yet or excuse me
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
receive funding but have not yet
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
received services 28
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
the challenge is finding a provider
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
agency to do it and even if they have a
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
provider agency finding staff within
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
that organization to do it it's the
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage that is the challenge
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
that to me that's good oversight
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
information and i'm happy to see zero
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
wait lists but i i think i think what we
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
really want to know is
 
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
what impact are we having on patient on
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
patients lives and so if we could figure
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
out a way to graphically represent this
 
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.030 align:start position:0%
out a way to graphically represent this
other

01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
yet to be served population i i i know
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
personally i'd like to be able to see
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
that as well suspect representative
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
mcmahon would i know senator rosenwald
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
loves data
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative salloway
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this is a
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up to your comments so looking at
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
the data
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay as you have it um
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
this is what we would call a double hump
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
distribution in statistics
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
and and statisticians see this all the
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
time and what this
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
commonly represents is
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
a hidden need
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh that just hasn't hit the record
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
keeping yet
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
so um my question is if you take a look
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
at the double hump
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
are we now going to see a rise again
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
and are we going to need policy changes
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with it is that going to go up
 
01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.189 align:start position:0%
to deal with it is that going to go up
again

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
so the humps that you reference here are
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
years that we did not receive enough
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
waiting list funding
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
um um in in our budget proposals and the
 
01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.310 align:start position:0%
um um in in our budget proposals and the
last

01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
since about
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
2016 on the waitlist has been fully
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
funded so that's why the numbers have
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
gone down so the
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
developmental services is contingent on
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
on the funding um through the waitlist
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
but also now that we're able to carry
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
our good folks
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you for coming by
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
have a great weekend i hope you have
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
and now we're ready for mr holt to come
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
give us our regular annual data report
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
on the therapeutic candidates program
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
is this is the state of our nation
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
our program
 
01:32:02.159 --> 01:32:03.270 align:start position:0%
our program
good

01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
or do we have problems so you see storms
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee the state of the therapeutic
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis program is good solid um their
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
the legalization bill this year did not
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
pass um so uh that that potential
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't threaten the uh you know the
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
program um for at least another year um
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
we'll revisit that next year depending
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
on what legislation comes through
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is michael holt
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm a section administrator for the
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
division of public health services i
 
01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
oversee both the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
program and the prescription drug
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
monitoring program i'll be providing
 
01:32:44.719 --> 01:32:45.669 align:start position:0%
monitoring program i'll be providing
summary

01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
summary
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
information for the two annual reports
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
for those two programs
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
so for the therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
the report is required by
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
rsa 126x10 it's also reported to the
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
board of nursing and the board of
 
01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.550 align:start position:0%
board of nursing and the board of
medicine

01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
and the report contains information from
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
three categories
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
the department's own therapeutic
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis registry
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
the annual reports that are submitted by
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment centers in the
 
01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.790 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment centers in the
state

01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
and an annual patient satisfaction
 
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.550 align:start position:0%
and an annual patient satisfaction
survey

01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
survey
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
so the report provides information about
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
designated caregivers and certifying
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
medical providers who are active in the
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
program as of june 30th 2021.
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
yes this is we're coming to you late
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
with this data
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
so the report highlights so the program
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
continues to experience growth um the
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
the program's seen steady growth over
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
its six years of existence uh and as of
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
last june the program had
 
01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.030 align:start position:0%
last june the program had
12

01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
12
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
237 registered qualifying patients
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
currently a year later
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
there are about 13
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
500 patients so still in this past year
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen program growth
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of patients are in their
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
50s and 60s
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
however we do have a very small number
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
of miners who are on the program as well
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
and as of the report date there were six
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
minors on on the program
 
01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:13.590 align:start position:0%
minors on on the program
uh

01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of the qualifying medical
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
conditions that
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
that one must have in order to be
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for the program again the vast
 
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
majority of patients more than 70
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
percent of patients on the program are
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
certified by their providers uh for
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
specific pain conditions either chronic
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
pain acute pain or spinal cord injury
 
01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.229 align:start position:0%
pain acute pain or spinal cord injury
disease

01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
disease
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
pain the other most frequent conditions
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we see are ptsd about 18 of the
 
01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.870 align:start position:0%
that we see are ptsd about 18 of the
population

01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
and cancer at about 6.5 percent of the
 
01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.669 align:start position:0%
and cancer at about 6.5 percent of the
population

01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
there are almost
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
1300 participating medical providers who
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
have certified at least one patient for
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
um that number continues to increase as
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
well providing greater access to uh to
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
the to the to the program for patients
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
76 percent are physicians 28 are aprns
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
can i ask you a question there
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
just to pinpoint on that
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
when i first became aware of this five
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
years ago or so there was active concern
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
amongst those with medical licenses that
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
they were under threat from the federal
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
government to have their medical
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
licenses pulled if they got too involved
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
in this program
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
that's the way i remember it
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
but in five years
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
what do you think the attitude has
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
become of the physicians involved in
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
this program
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
well certainly in new hampshire there's
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
been no federal action taken against any
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire licensed physician aprn or
 
01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.790 align:start position:0%
new hampshire licensed physician aprn or
pa

01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
pa
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
in this regard
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
there is stigma still associated with
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
many providers
 
01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:54.870 align:start position:0%
many providers
simply

01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
won't certify their patients even if
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
they have a qualifying medical condition
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
the barrier to entry for
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
for uh providers is is minimal um
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
in that there's no registration
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
requirements there's no continuing
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
medical education requirements uh there
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
is no list right of of certifying
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
providers in the state um if you're
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
lucky enough as a patient to
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
have a have a have an existing
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with a provider who's
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
willing to certify you you're you're in
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
good shape but we see
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh we hear regularly from patients it's
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
the it's
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's the most common
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
call or question that we get of
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
my doctor won't certify me
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
what do i do
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
um and so you're absolutely right that
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
stigma still remains amongst the
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh the the
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
provider community about entering this
 
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
area um this alternative therapy um
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
their reasons aren't illegitimate i mean
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
there's potential liability issues
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
it is not a federally fda approved drug
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
it is federally illegal etc
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
but the experience has borne out that
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
there is little to no risk for licensure
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
actions against providers who are in
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
this market thank you for that
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative murphy has a question uh
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question um
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
so just from what you just said is the
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
requirement simply that the physician or
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
the provider have an active license uh
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the state to qualify a patient for
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
this program
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
right yes they must be licensed by uh
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
they must be licensed um
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
as a position um an aprn or a p a
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
physician assistant um they must have
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
prescriptive authority a dea regis
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
registration number for prescribing
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
control substances um there must be a
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
bona fide provider-patient relationship
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the patient um they must do uh you
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
know uh your your regular assessment see
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
the per the patient in person etc so
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
there's a number of requirements but
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
most of them align closely with um by
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
the provider's scope of practice what is
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
interesting though is that there are
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
provider types that do have prescriptive
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
authority in the state that are not on
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
the list of certifying providers for
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis um dentists podiatrists um are
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
not on the list um
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh we know that uh you know people's
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
teeth hurt you know
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it wouldn't be inappropriate to
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
consider that on that expansion of the
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
provider types that could be uh uh
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
certifying for the program and also um
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors have limited
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
prescriptive authority um and they're
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
not on the list and when you think about
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis as an herbal uh you know
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
treatment um it seems natural to you
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
know to consider naturopaths as well um
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
so that's an area of potential you know
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
legislation um to uh to look at
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
expanding the provider types allowed to
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
certify patients no cme requirements at
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
all no okay thank you
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
so which legislator are you who is are
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
you working with
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're uh this is a congress this is a
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
topic that has come up with the
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
board um so uh representative canark is
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
interested in considering this
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
legislation um and uh we'll be working
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
with him over the summer um whether or
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
not we don't know if it's department
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
requested or if it's tcmo be uh
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
requested uh but uh jerry cannor can we
 
01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.350 align:start position:0%
requested uh but uh jerry cannor can we
uh

01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
look at that okay since i already threw
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
you off here your
 
01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:14.550 align:start position:0%
you off here your
your

01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's a great question thank you uh i um
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
how how is
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
the pricing of our therapeutic cannabis
 
01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:23.510 align:start position:0%
the pricing of our therapeutic cannabis
program

01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
um competing
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
with the uh the free market uh black
 
01:39:28.159 --> 01:39:29.189 align:start position:0%
with the uh the free market uh black
market

01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:39:29.199 --> 01:39:31.910 align:start position:0%
market
prices

01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
are we
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
five times greater ten times greater i
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
have no idea what wheat goes for
 
01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what black market prices
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
are um i do know that there is a gray
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
market um there is a gray market uh
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis um coming from medical cannabis
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
coming out of maine um the uh the main
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
model allows for
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
caregivers to register with the state
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
but they are not regulated by the state
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
so the costs are very low
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
so they the um essentially you could uh
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
in maine you register with the state as
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
a caregiver and you can grow cannabis in
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
your yard in your barn in your fields in
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
your basement and say that's medical
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
marijuana sell it to patients with cards
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
and there's no cost i mean the costs are
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
very low so the cost for uh there's no
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
cost for testing there's no regulations
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
regarding pesticide use etc so that
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
market is is significantly less by
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
almost a half of what the new hampshire
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
medical um cannabis is being sold for in
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
the dispensaries if you were to compare
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
the prices in new hampshire with the
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
prices in a regulated market say in
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts it's they are
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
comparable um uh
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
recreational in massachusetts is higher
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
due to the tax structure than
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
both the the prices of medical in both
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and new hampshire um
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
i will i will offer that so one of the
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
biggest policy changes that we've seen
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
in 20 in in this past
 
01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:03.350 align:start position:0%
in 20 in in this past
year

01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
was the implementation of a portion of
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
senate bill 162
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
that was department requested
 
01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:09.830 align:start position:0%
that was department requested
legislation

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
that in part allowed
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire registered patients to
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
access all of the atcs in new hampshire
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
before that law passed a patient had to
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
go to one at a time they had to they had
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
to sign up with a particular atc there's
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
only three atc's um
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
in in the in the state so what that bill
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
did was allowed uh the the the patient
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
population to go to all seven of the
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
locations throughout the state
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
the the hope of that bill in addition to
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
increasing access to patients throughout
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
the state um was to create a bit of
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
friendly competition amongst the atc's
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
prices have come down a little bit
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
modestly it's you know
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
still most patients can't afford the
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis that they want to alleviate
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
their symptoms
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
but we have seen prices come down
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
because of that that competitive model
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
it's been interesting to see um one of
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
the atc's prime atc you know was the
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
first to lower their prices um in
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
anticipation of this uh of this bill
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
happening um and the other and the other
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh atc's followed suit
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
i'll come to you second to the follow-up
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
would it help the competitive natures of
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
the atc is if new hampshire law
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
allowing the atcs to deliver cannabis to
 
01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:41.109 align:start position:0%
allowing the atcs to deliver cannabis to
patients

01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
the primary benefit of that would be
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
allowing people
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
who have access issues transportation
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
issues mobility issues people who can't
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
get to the dispensaries themselves or
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
have to pay a caregiver to drive them
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
that would be the the greatest advantage
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
of allowing home delivery
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
however that would be a premium
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
service and there
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
i would i would assume that there would
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
be an additional cost associated with a
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
delivery service um associated with uh
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
with that would you mind asking the atcs
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
if they might be interested in that
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
being able to do that
 
01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.070 align:start position:0%
being able to do that
yes

01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the atc's are
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
interested in exploring that idea um i
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
will say that it is not the legislative
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
it is not the statute that prohibits uh
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
home delivery of cannabis by the atc
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
it is is um is the department's
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that prohibit that
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
um and and so it would it would be a
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
rule change
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
on our part to allow that um it is an
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
area that we uh that we've started
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
exploring especially due to um the uh
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um
 
01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.350 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um
um

01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
and we haven't we haven't pursued it uh
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
since we we
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
achieved other models curbside um and uh
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
drive through windows et cetera uh like
 
01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
like that but it's it's a it's a topic
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
for policy discussion certainly all
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative marshall
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i have a comment and a
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
question uh first of all uh i thank you
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
for your very complete uh report mr holt
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's a very excellent report uh i did
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
want to add uh to representative edwards
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
earlier question that the reluctance of
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
physicians dealt with prescribing not
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
certifying because prescribing uh for a
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
physician could easily be considered as
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
a violation of our licensure
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with warning
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
posters regarding cannabis use when
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
pregnant when lactating uh during
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
adolescence and accidental poisonings i
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't see any mention of the
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
implementation of that program in uh
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
your report and if you could comment on
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
that please yes thank you um and thank
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
you for the sponsoring that legislation
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
that uh whatever that does require the
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
atc's to provide
 
01:44:50.239 --> 01:44:51.030 align:start position:0%
atc's to provide
um

01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
warning information in at the the
 
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
dispensary locations we've been working
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
with uh so that work is in progress um
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
we've been working with the therapeutic
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board to
 
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
develop the content of those uh those
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
informational bursars basically the the
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
risks themselves as you know that was a
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
provision in the law to
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
not establish the risks in statute
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
rather give the medical oversight board
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of establishing those
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh those risks um we are very close uh
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
we're working with uh with uh with chi
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh and we're very close to um uh and
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully this summer uh
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
releasing the um the brochures and the
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
posters relative to
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
um a pregnancy um we are not as far
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
along with the the adolescent risks
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
however we do have the the oversight
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
board um has completed their work in
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
terms of uh um the list of risks that
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
should be included in in those
 
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.229 align:start position:0%
should be included in in those
information

01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up question i i thank you for
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
that um as i'm sure you're aware we
 
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
added that requirement to the marijuana
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
legalization bill that passed the house
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh by floor amendment uh in recent
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
session and uh the intent was to have
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
this available such that if we do
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis that we would be able
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
to use the same sorts of things
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the state um can you
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
comment on that yeah i i appreciated
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
that amendment um
 
01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:15.510 align:start position:0%
that amendment um
uh

01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
it would be very it would be very
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
important to establish the same
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
or provide access
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh to the information uh for a
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
recreational market as as well so um
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
that was a you know when i think of the
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
legalization bills that we've seen in
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
the past um what i don't see in them is
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh public health concerns um addressed
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh proactively and uh and seeing that
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
language um added um to the bill was was
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
really was really great thank you thank
 
01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:43.510 align:start position:0%
really was really great thank you thank
you

01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
so so one of the things i've said to
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
people when they ask me why i support um
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and and why would
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh recreational cannabis
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
is that i believe the country has such a
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
severe fentanyl
 
01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:01.990 align:start position:0%
severe fentanyl
problem

01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
that a street
 
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.590 align:start position:0%
that a street
pot

01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
pot
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
is subject to being laced with fentanyl
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
truly a public health hazard if people
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
smoke it and die
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i i think this is true is there
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
anything that you know that tell that
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
that you should tell me that i'm wrong
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i'll quit telling people i'm trying
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
to mitigate the uh the fentanyl risk
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
i want there to be a source of of clean
 
01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:30.629 align:start position:0%
i want there to be a source of of clean
uh

01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
validated um marijuana
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
i don't have any specific information
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
related to cases in new hampshire or the
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
region of
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
fentanyl-raised cannabis um however i
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
can tell you that it makes absolute
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
sense it is true that a regulated
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
product is going to be safer than an
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
unregulated product
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
so absolutely
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
legal recreational adult use sales will
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
decrease the amount of black market not
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily gray market gray market is
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
it is legal to grow it is
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
illegal to give away it is not legal to
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
sell to your you know friends or
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
neighbors you know that's what we would
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
call gray market but a regulated product
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
is absolutely the the way to go um
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's you know cases of
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
fentanyl based cannabis in new hampshire
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't i can't speak to that
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
but you know when we think of it when
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
if you want me to continue if we think
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
about that you know the main model where
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the unregulated care giver
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis is
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
has no restrictions on pesticide use
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
isn't required to be tested
 
01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.430 align:start position:0%
isn't required to be tested
um

01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
and we're sending and and people are
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
going across the border to to maine to
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
purchase because it is half the price
 
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know um for severely immune
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
compromised uh patients that's that's
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
not ideal you know so regulated products
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
are you know absolutely the
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
the way to go to to increase public
 
01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.189 align:start position:0%
the way to go to to increase public
safety

01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
so follow up on regulation and maybe
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
this is out of your domain but i think i
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
probably have an opinion i suspect you
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
know a lot
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
um back in the good old days when i was
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
18 and my family would go to colorado
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
they would have something called 3.2
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
beer which is a lower alcohol content
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
bigger than the regular beer that the
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
grownups got to drink and so this got me
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
to thinking because i keep hearing how
 
01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.149 align:start position:0%
to thinking because i keep hearing how
today's

01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
today's
 
01:49:24.159 --> 01:49:25.030 align:start position:0%
today's
pot

01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
pot
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
is has so much thc that
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's too much and that
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's evidence of psychotic reaction
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
to the thc
 
01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
levels i'm just wondering if
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
if it might be a good idea for us if we
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
come back and we look at a legal
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
recreational pot again if there's a way
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
for us to stipulate
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
some lower thc content that would be
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
manufactured and marketed
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
as a less
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
powerful potent
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh option
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
i think that's a i think that's a great
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
idea um there's nothing just there's
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
nothing to stop uh the the legislature
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
from establishing that or the uh the
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory entity from establishing that
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
requirement um ultimately comes down to
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
the market and what people want to buy
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
um but if
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
the only cannabis flower products
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
available in a store have extremely high
 
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.109 align:start position:0%
available in a store have extremely high
thc

01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
thc
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
then there's no option for those uh
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
adults or those patients to purchase a
 
01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
lower potency product um so you know so
 
01:50:34.159 --> 01:50:35.910 align:start position:0%
lower potency product um so you know so
sure

01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
mandating a lower thc product as part of
 
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
the product offering is not an
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
unreasonable idea
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
do they effectively do that in the atcs
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
have gradations of thc content
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
we still see a we still see a a tendency
 
01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:56.070 align:start position:0%
we still see a we still see a a tendency
towards

01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
the highest thc product gets you know
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know is is is exciting for for
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
patients and it's and it's and it's
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
attractive um even though that is not
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
the product that's going to help them
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
with their condition you know the the
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
best um
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
but yeah to answer your question the
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
atcs all have a range of products with
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
different thc levels um they um that
 
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
they're growing you know they have cbd
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
rich strains as well that um that have
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh more cbd in them than thc so it
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
becomes a ratio product um and though
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
are fewer but they are increasing um we
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
inspected one of the facilities uh just
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
last week and and they started a
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
genetics program you know basically
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
cross-breeding their own um their own
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
strains and one of the goals for the uh
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
for this particular atc is to create
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
more cbd
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
strains low thc strains for those
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
patients that want them
 
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh so you got thrown way off track on
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
your um therapeutic cannabis breathing
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
do you have something specifically the
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
rest of the rest of it the rest of this
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
is boring it's just data um
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
i would say that uh you know the atc
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i'll highlight a couple things you
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
know the atc's
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
collect effectiveness data
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
from patients
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
between nine and 32 percent depending on
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
the atc participate in that reporting of
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
effectiveness data um 88 to 97
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
you know of those respondents say it's
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know positive has positive feedback
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to effectiveness
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
satisfaction survey 99 of the patients
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
surveyed you know um say that the the
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
improved quality of life they'd
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
recommend the program to others who
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
qualify um you know we don't see that
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
kind of that that kind of success you
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
know in other programs you know the
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
people who are on this program um
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
they they need it they they appreciate
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
it they want to see it expand um they
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
want to see the cost come down that's
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
the number one concern of patients um
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
and and the other and the other policy
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
change that they would like to see
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
happen in new hampshire um
 
01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.270 align:start position:0%
happen in new hampshire um
is

01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
the allowance for home cultivation for
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients it's you
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
know we hear that we hear that message
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
loud and clear all of the other issues
 
01:53:09.119 --> 01:53:10.390 align:start position:0%
loud and clear all of the other issues
uh

01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
that patients experience would lessen if
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
they were allowed to to cultivate their
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh their own um this past year um all of
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
the atc's came out in favor of home
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
cultivation for the first time um and so
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
the concern of like it would impact
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
their business model um
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
they considered it and they're like no
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
this is good for patients and so they
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
support it as well so
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
with uh yeah the program's running
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
smoothly cars going out on time within
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
statutory time frames um and they're you
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
know get get hardly any complaints
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
except for where can i find a doctor
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
why does it cost so much
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
when can i grow my own
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the community
 
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
because i think you still have the
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:55.750 align:start position:0%
i do
okay

01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:57.510 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this this may uh this may take
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
longer um it's possible um i will say
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:54:03.679 --> 01:54:04.470 align:start position:0%
that uh
the

01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program is
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
a is a new program for me personally um
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
and and so uh the the the thoroughness
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
in which i can answer questions about
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program may not
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
be matched uh with with the pmp uh so
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
that said um
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
this prescription drug monitoring
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
program uh annual report uh required by
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
statute um and it contains again data
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 2021 um so you know
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
closing period of june 30th 2021 again
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
this data is old as well we have one
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
slide that shows trends moving you know
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
into into this year um and i'll get to
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
that later um so it's been a transition
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
year for the pdmp as uh everyone knows
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
on july 1st um the pdmp was transferred
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
from the office of professional
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification to the
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
through house bill 2.
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
um pdmp staff was were transferred over
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
um to dhhs as well
 
01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:58.950 align:start position:0%
um to dhhs as well
um

01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
but the program administrator position
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
for the pdmp has been was vacant for
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
about a year um
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
so a significant amount of institutional
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge has been lost due to that
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
vacancy and due to the transfer
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
we did successfully hire a program
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
administrator um in april of this year
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
his name's sean jackson he's sitting in
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
the gallery uh behind you he may be
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
coming to you next year with the pdmp
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
report um so uh i just wanted to you
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
know call him out um so i'm gonna i'm
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
gonna focus my narrative on on program
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
updates since the program has been at
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
hhs even though the data report in front
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
of you is from
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
the previous fiscal year
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
other than the agency transfer the most
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
significant change to the pdmp this past
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
year was the passage of senate bill 45
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
from the 2021 session that bill
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
permitted the integration of pdmp data
 
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
into um
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire natural practitioner's
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
electronic health records um
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
so uh what does this mean well
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
integration allows pdmp data to become
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
part of the clinical workflow for
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
providers where it's most valuable
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
previous to this providers had to go to
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
a separate web portal login
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
run their patient query review their
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
prescription history
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
outside of their the clinical workflow
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh and this bill uh allowed for the the
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
integration um it makes
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
access to the pdmp data more efficient
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
more compliant with state law and
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
contributing to better clinical
 
01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:28.470 align:start position:0%
contributing to better clinical
the outcomes

01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
the outcomes
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
what's the status of that integration
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
authorizing it is is very different than
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
having the vendors who sell ehrs uh
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
change your software to implement it
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so do you know what the
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
actual implementation status is uh yes i
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
can't tell you specific numbers of
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
entities that have adopted it already
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that in january
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
january of this year we entered into a
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
new multi-year contract with our pdmp
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
vendor they're called bamboo health
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
formerly apparenthealth um and
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that contract that
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
contract contained support for this
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
integration module it's called pmp
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
gateway we have launched
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
this uh this module and there has been
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
uptake um in the in the provider
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
community for it all the the major
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
retail pharmacy chains um have adopted
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
it and a number of smaller providers as
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
you as you say the the
 
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
the larger health systems
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
dartmouth elliott concord they're going
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
to have to work with their ehr vendors
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
and do that transition um so that's
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to take some time
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
but we've we've met a number of times
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire hospital
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
association they're well aware of this
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh this opportunity um and and and many
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
facilities are moving forward with that
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
so it's it's available um
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
the the other piece of that is that the
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
the state is funding the first two years
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
of this integration through the contract
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
um and so you know it is it is in every
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
health entity's best interest to get on
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
board as soon as possible um to have the
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
benefit of this uh this service um
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
before they potentially have to pay for
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
it we're gonna continue looking for
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
other uh funding sources um you know uh
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
before it expires to see if we can
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
continue funding it um but uh
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
but yes so it's uh it's it's out there
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
and available
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
um the contract is a number of other
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
enhancements i won't get into that i
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
know we're you know short on time i want
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
to highlight that the other significant
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
change to the pdmp this past year um was
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
also the result of house bill 2. um
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt and i had a
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
conversation about this
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and many of you may know
 
01:58:34.239 --> 01:58:35.030 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and many of you may know
this

01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 changed the confidentiality
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
standard applicable to the release of
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
data from the pdmp
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
um pdmp has always been limited in what
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
in what kind of data it could share
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
and that only de-identified aggregate
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
data could be released uh what house
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
bill 2 did
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
was introduce a specific hipaa standard
 
01:58:53.599 --> 01:58:54.709 align:start position:0%
was introduce a specific hipaa standard
um

01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
which is specifically cited in statute
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the safe harbor standard
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
it reads the it reads all patient
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
specific protected health information
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
shall be de-identified in accordance
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
with section 164.514
 
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
b2 of the hipaa privacy rule
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
in part this means that all location
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
identifiers smaller than the entire
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
state must be removed including city and
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
including county
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
the only exception to this standard in
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
the in in hipaa rule is an allowance to
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
use the first three digits of a zip code
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
we call this zip three
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
but only if the area formed by that zip
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
three region has more than twenty
 
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
thousand people
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
you can you can see where i'm going
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it has one of 17 zip three
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
areas in the entire country with less
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
than 20 000 people
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
so ironically the effort in house bill 2
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
to protect the privacy of new hampshire
 
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
citizens by citing the safe harbor
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
standard actually decreases the privacy
 
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
protections afforded by the law for this
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
particular region of the state
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
to protect against this decrease in
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
privacy the report in front of you
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
presents data from this region combined
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
or integrated with uh with an adjacent
 
02:00:12.390 --> 02:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
region i'd ask you to take a look at
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
page 4 of the report in front of you so
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
so we created a we created a zip 3 map
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
which over which overlays the the zip
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
three regions onto the county regions
 
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see that you'll see that nothing
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
map you know nothing matches up
 
02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:34.709 align:start position:0%
map you know nothing matches up
um

02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
so what does this what does this mean uh
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
well the change breaks the continuity of
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
historical pdm pdp data that's been
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
released since the program began
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
and i would argue that you know county
 
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
data is the fundamental locational unit
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
of data used by hhs and other agencies
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
and for pdmp data to not be available by
 
02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.350 align:start position:0%
and for pdmp data to not be available by
county

02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
means that the utility of pdmp data
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
statewide is diminished
 
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
so we at hhs would encourage the
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
legislature to take another look at this
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
change um to the confidentiality
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
standard and see perhaps if there's
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
other options here um allowing allowing
 
02:01:18.870 --> 02:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
county level data to be released would
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
go some way to to fixing the immediate
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
need of um of releasing more consistent
 
02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:25.510 align:start position:0%
need of um of releasing more consistent
data

02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt thank you we did have
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
a conversation
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday but i'd like to
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
um just state publicly that
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
what i said to mr holt was the
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislature's action to better protect
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
the privacy was intentional
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
it was not
 
02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
a mistake by the legislature
 
02:01:53.350 --> 02:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
so while we might be open to
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
allowing the identification down to
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
county level because it's more
 
02:01:58.159 --> 02:01:59.430 align:start position:0%
county level because it's more
protective

02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
protective
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
i think if the department
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
tries to risk
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
to loosen the privacy protections beyond
 
02:02:07.119 --> 02:02:07.990 align:start position:0%
to loosen the privacy protections beyond
that

02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think there will be pushback from the
 
02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
i think there will be pushback from the
legislature

02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you my guess having
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
worked with you
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to just say that
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
publicly rather than
 
02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
between me and mr holt on the phone
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
we would we would be
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um we would be happy
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
with uh with with uh the change to
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
county only i mean that gets us that
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
gets us you know much much closer to
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
um so let me let me run really quickly
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
through some of the data in here um
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
how much time do you think you need
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
without panic
 
02:02:48.790 --> 02:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
where you could just tell three minutes
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
oh okay great
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'll just give everyone in the audience
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
a heads up if you have something for the
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh oversight committee in about three or
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
four minutes you'll be invited
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um so
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
provider registration counts have
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
increased by 12
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
patient queries
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
providers querying the system
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
for a patient's prescription histories
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
have increased by five percent
 
02:03:16.719 --> 02:03:18.390 align:start position:0%
have increased by five percent
um

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'd ask you to take a look at page eight
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the report this shows uh prescription
 
02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
of the report this shows uh prescription
trends

02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
trends
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
um by drug type for a two year period
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
starting in july 2019
 
02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
opioids filled prescription counts for
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
opioids have decreased by seven percent
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
filled prescription counts for
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
stimulants however have increased by 14
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
sedatives gone down by five
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page nine we've project
 
02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:47.510 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page nine we've project
we've

02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
we've
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh this like i said earlier this data is
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
older um slide nine shows these trends
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
continue through quarter three of the
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year through march 2022
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
opioids continue their downward trend
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
down 13
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
stimulants continue their upward trend
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
up 22
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
sedatives down 6 percent
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
um the slides that follow break down
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
this data a little more
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
the decrease in opioids is consistent
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
across not only prescription counts but
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
also days supply and potency
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
the increase in stimulants is consistent
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
across prescription count day supply and
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
total milligrams prescribed
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
um and there are some location-based
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
slides in there as well for your review
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
but it's not particularly meaningful to
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
say that region zero three three three
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
experienced a percentage drop in opioid
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
prescription counts um
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
so there are at least three people on
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
that could respond to this better than i
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
could um the fact that our stimulant use
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
is going up
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
it would is obviously a red flag
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
what what's the potentiality of this
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
what are the downsides or the positive
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
sides and i'd like i'd like to hear
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
i i can't answer that i can tell you
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
that we the division of public health
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
services in particular is very
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
interested in this data and we're
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
starting to look carefully at it and um
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
to explore what it might mean what it
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
might mean in the future what it might
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
mean for our for for kids being
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
prescribed um these uh these stimulants
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
at a young age and continuing that use
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
into into adulthood um
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
for hhs this is new data um and and it's
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:05:32.159 --> 02:05:33.109 align:start position:0%
and it's
it's

02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
and we will be working with this uh
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
stimulate data in the in the coming year
 
02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
so mr chair can i have some follow-up
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
well he's on the same line oh yeah
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh i i just was going to ask
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
mr williams to add to the 23 september
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
the department to come back and talk
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
the issues around the stimulant increase
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
but go ahead yes
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure most of us are aware mr
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
james potter the medical society spoke
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
on numerous occasions about the natural
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
natural history of opioid epidemics and
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
he has stated uh that typically
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
an opioid epidemic is followed by a
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
stimulant epidemic
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
and he has speculated on numerous
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
occasions that the next epidemic in new
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would be metamphetamine
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
i'm particularly concerned about the
 
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
stimulant increase and my question is
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
has the department discussed with the
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
medical society if further education is
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
needed regarding increased stimulant use
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
which you referred to in page five and
 
02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
also in the prescribing data which you
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
cited and my second question
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
02:06:46.079 --> 02:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
has to do with
the

02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
whether legislation is
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
advisable regarding the need to query
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
the pdmp right now one has to query the
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
pdm people for prescribing an opioid but
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement to query the
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
pdmp before prescribing a stimulant and
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
that could easily be added in
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislation does the department think
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
that would be a good idea thank you
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh we have not had conversations with
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
the medical society on this topic yet
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
but again this is this is uh especially
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
with a a september
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
date to come back here and provide
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
updates we certainly will over the
 
02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:25.350 align:start position:0%
updates we certainly will over the
summer

02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
i can't say whether it's a good idea or
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
not to require um use we you certainly
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
could require on pdmp queries uh prior
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
to uh um admin uh
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
prescribing uh stimulant
 
02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
i wanna look at some um have
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
conversations about what we think this
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
means um before that but there's uh
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why we can't have
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
those conversations while there's
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislation pending
 
02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:50.709 align:start position:0%
legislation pending
so

02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:50.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for that represent marsh
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
so um given that there are multiple
 
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
entities that you would want to maybe
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
voice an opinion and have an integrated
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
solution from is the 23rd of september a
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time for you to
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
come back and give us a briefing on on
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
this trend and what we might want to do
 
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
to proactively engage it
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
september is certainly a time that we
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
could give you status on what we have
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
so far um i don't think you know summer
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know two months in the summer is
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
going to give us enough time to to
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
get give you what you want um but we're
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
happy to come back in september to let
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
you know where we're at
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
dr murphy uh thank you in i would just
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
echo the the concerns about the rise of
 
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
stimulant use
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
experientially using the opioids and
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
prescribing as we did
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
was uh oftentimes onerous and therefore
 
02:08:50.069 --> 02:08:50.079 align:start position:0%
we knew that you know it made it
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
difficult to prescribe regularly
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
there was a time as you know when that
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
was the fifth you know vitasign pain and
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
we responded to that by prescribing
 
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
opioids since the pdmp has come into
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
effect that has gone down substantially
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
but without monitoring the stimulants
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
that has gone up not only because of the
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
increase in use in the youths in youth
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
but also that as an alternative but i
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
would just
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
echo the sentiment about maybe
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
legislation to help you know monitor
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
that because my experience is that
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
providers respond to data if you have
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
data to show them with use of a drug or
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
prescribing a drug they tend to respond
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
to it so i think it would be a great
 
02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:30.069 align:start position:0%
to it so i think it would be a great
idea

02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
i would expect that
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
once the the gateway product the
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
integration product um is adopted more
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
widely within the state the ease of use
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
of the pdmp um will increase um it will
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
also the number of actual practitioners
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
use it utilizing um the pdmp will
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
increase currently about 55 of queries
 
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
are made by delegates not the
 
02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
practitioners themselves um and so um
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the legislation from last year that
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
allow that integration is crucial um to
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
reducing the barrier uh for potential
 
02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:07.109 align:start position:0%
reducing the barrier uh for potential
legislation

02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
that would increase the mandatory use of
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
we did not specify a not later than date
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
and that legislation for the integration
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
though did we were and
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
if we did when is it and if we didn't
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
should we have i'm not sure i understand
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
not later then well uh it's one thing to
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
tell somebody that they have to do
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
something but then the next question
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
gets to be well when does it need to be
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
done the legislature did not tell them
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
tell providers that they have to do this
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature permitted it
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
permitted the pdmp
 
02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
to enter into contracts and with uh to
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
integrate so there's no there's no
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
mandate for
 
02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:46.870 align:start position:0%
mandate for
um

02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
healthcare entities to adopt this
 
02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
integration module um
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're you know we're
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
um for the first two years and you know
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
that may be another consideration
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
if there's no funding two years from now
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know for this integration you know
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
will we see healthcare providers
 
02:11:08.550 --> 02:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
especially smaller and smaller entities
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know um use it for a year and then
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
stop using it so that may be a
 
02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
consideration as well if we're um if uh
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
for future legislation and funding
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay so you know david weeders
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
just talked to him about the budget very
 
02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
on a related
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
um issue with the pdmp the department
 
02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
used to report
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
what percentage of
 
02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:39.990 align:start position:0%
what percentage of
the

02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
prescribers by category
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
were registered with the program and
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
using it
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
i think there are seven
 
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
licensed types where their licensees
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
can prescribe controlled substances
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
is the department still able to
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
tell us what percentage of veterinarians
 
02:12:03.599 --> 02:12:04.470 align:start position:0%
tell us what percentage of veterinarians
are

02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
registered and using it naturopaths
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
who actually can prescribe this stuff
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
and the other
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
licensed categories can you do that yes
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
yeah the the we're still we'll start
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're still collecting that data we
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
didn't present it in this report but
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're but we have that i hope you will
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
include it in
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
next reports absolutely thank you thank
 
02:12:28.719 --> 02:12:36.069 align:start position:0%
next reports absolutely thank you thank
you

02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:38.560 align:start position:0%

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:21.430 align:start position:0%
of september during the course of the

02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
um this was suggested by mr williams mr
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
williams is there any specific reason
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
you pick the 23rd of september for the
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards thank you very much for
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
the record john williams legislative
 
02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
director for health and human services
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that date was based upon
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
communication with the um chair of the
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee represent pearson and he had
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me that he had intended and
 
02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
provided a few items for the agenda for
 
02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
friday september 23rd it doesn't
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
preclude he may want to elect having it
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
earlier however given that the house has
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
around mileage until the end of august
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
it makes sense that in all likelihood it
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
will be friday september 23rd
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
i i have no issue does anyone on the
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
committee have an issue with that
 
02:14:15.599 --> 02:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
committee have an issue with that

02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you so
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i would recommend that we just go
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
ahead and forward and plan on the 23rd
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
of september for the next meeting
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
um is i think we've completed our work
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
as a committee any last calls uh
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative murphy just a quick
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
question of representative salloway on
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
in i'm sorry i didn't get the
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
handout that you gave us on precision
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
medicine which i fully support and agree
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
with and would love to see develop
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
task force i didn't see
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
physician representation on that is the
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical society intended
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
to be a physician or provider like a
 
02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist or a primary care provider
 
02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
i believe there is an intent to include
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
the medical society
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
i would add parenthetically
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative that you would make a
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
superb member of that task force
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
