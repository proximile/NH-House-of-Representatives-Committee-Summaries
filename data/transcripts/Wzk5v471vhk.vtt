00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 142 came about
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh because our present statute is 20
 
00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:57.190 align:start position:0%
uh because our present statute is 20
plus

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
plus
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
years old and it doesn't reflect the
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
changes in society
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
like same-gender marriages
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
and the serious issues with substance
 
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.430 align:start position:0%
and the serious issues with substance
abuse

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
this bill simply updates those laws
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
to take them into consideration during
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
yet another difficult time
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to mention that in the
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
courts right now the
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
case blaisdell is addressing this issue
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
and there will be a finding from the
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
courts in regards to
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
um yes in addition to
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
what representative grossman has pointed
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
out that this is already working its way
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
through the courts
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
and we are just awaiting a decision um
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
line 14 doesn't make any
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
um doesn't clarify whether
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
the abuse of substances is concurrent
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
consecutive with other if there is if
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
there are two
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
two substances and that's a um
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
you know a side-by-side abuse it doesn't
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
say whether it's you know two years in a
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
row or
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
if it is somebody who is in and out of
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
um trying to
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
go through some sort of a recovery
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
program so it's just
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
very nebulous and it's um it's not very
 
00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:53.350 align:start position:0%
very nebulous and it's um it's not very
specific

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
and i think it causes a lot of problems
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
in that lack of specificity
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
so um i i'm going to vote against this
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
because i don't
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
i think that i like the idea of it but i
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's very specific and i
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
think it opens up
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there any further
 
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.390 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there any further

00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
of the child can be
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%

to pass as amended
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative yokela yes so
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to recap that um this is
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
just trying to implement the
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations by
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
the study done on child support
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
i believe back in 2018 it raises the
 
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.710 align:start position:0%
i believe back in 2018 it raises the
self

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
self
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
reserve support to 120 percent
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
it um allows
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
for a shared parenting plan formula
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it changes the um child support
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines based on the percentage of
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
combined net income to better reflect
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
what is actually
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
um on the ground essentially
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
now so uh i hope that you will support
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you very much
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you madam
 
00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:30.789 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you madam
chair

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
um although a little more plaudible with
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
with the amendment um i i think we're
 
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.630 align:start position:0%
with the amendment um i i think we're
sending

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
sending
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
a wrong message to parents that
 
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.630 align:start position:0%
a wrong message to parents that
co-parent

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
co-parent
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
if you're not taking your child
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
overnight you're not co-parenting
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i i think that's wrong and i i and
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
with respect to the study the study
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
had a redo calculation so i'm not
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
convinced that
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
the calculations are what we need uh so
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'll be
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
voting no any further discussion
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative wiki thank you madam
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
chair we have an ongoing problem
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
and perhaps this is not the perfect bill
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
but we do need to help parents and
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
children now not
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
in the future so if we cast this then we
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my i appreciate
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment and i voted for the
 
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.990 align:start position:0%
the amendment and i voted for the
amendment

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
um my my objection lies in lines eight
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
and nine
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
is that shared parenting where the is
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
with where the child
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
overnights 30 or more of the time
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
i think that's an enormous conflict
 
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.509 align:start position:0%
i think that's an enormous conflict
creator

00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
creator
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
and um is
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't know where that came
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
from in the study
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh and i don't think that it's an
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate place
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
to um tell parents
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
that a 30 of their time
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
with their child while they're sleeping
 
00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:09.990 align:start position:0%
with their child while they're sleeping
overnight

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
is shared parenting and i think it's
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to cause
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
way more problems than any of the rest
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the formula
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
could possibly help so i do not support
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%

went

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
went
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
after i i forgot i didn't lower it from
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
the last bill so sorry
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
that's why i asked representative long
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't give me the warm and
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
fuzzy on the last bill we just voted on
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
if we need to retain
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
something to make sure that does all
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
right uh when we're talking about
 
00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.950 align:start position:0%
right uh when we're talking about
co-parenting

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
co-parenting
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the children aren't involved it's
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's parents we're taking care of
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
parents with respect to calculation of
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
child support
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
the children aren't the children aren't
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
involved it's between the parents
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh it's between the parents on child
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
support and
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh co-parenting now i
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh i absolutely
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
feel that we should encourage
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
co-parenting which
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
this may do probably not at the best
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
case scenario
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh because i do believe there's going to
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
be conflict so retaining this bill
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh which is which is a different
 
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.069 align:start position:0%
uh which is which is a different
calculation

00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh and different requirements of the
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
last one we just voted on i
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
i don't believe is uh sends the right
 
00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.270 align:start position:0%
i don't believe is uh sends the right
message

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
message
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you is there any further
 
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.069 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you is there any further
discussion

00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative about shiller yeah
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
yes i actually did raise my hand this
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
time it's painting
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
um so i i um
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
i do not support this bill and
 
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.829 align:start position:0%
i do not support this bill and
specifically

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
in line four into line five creating a
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
where the parties have agreed there is
 
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.069 align:start position:0%
where the parties have agreed there is
there's

00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
if we are if there is a um if we're
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
reaching this point
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
um in a child support case there's no
 
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.470 align:start position:0%
um in a child support case there's no
rebuttable

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
rebuttable
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
presumption and also in line 12
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
it says if the lower income party were
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
to pay the higher income party that's a
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
is so out of the realm
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
um the difference from the amounts shall
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
be the presumptive child support
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
so it's basically setting up the higher
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
earning parent
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
to um look for ways to minimize their
 
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.589 align:start position:0%
to um look for ways to minimize their
income

00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and i think that that's a you know
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
because it happens
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
it happens now to codify that and to
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
create an
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
avenue for them to do that is um i think
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
unconscionable and we heard testimony
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
um setting up for one parent
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
to look to be underemployed for a period
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
um is something that happens now
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
and we certainly don't want to make it
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
permanent or encourage it so i
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think that we should just um itl this
 
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.190 align:start position:0%
i think that we should just um itl this
bill

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
and come at it from a different angle
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
next year all together
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%

just fixes some working as i introduced
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
it last week during
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh a committee hearing
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
so on line 11
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
and was suggested
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
to change if you change and
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
um on line 11 just speak to
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
your amendment not suggestions that were
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
made okay
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
the intent behind the bill is to make it
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
easier for families to go through the
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
adoption process
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
there are safeguards in place
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
that help protect the child for example
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
guardians of life
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
guarding the item rsa is 461 which

representative long thank you madam
 
00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:39.030 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you madam
chair

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
um so my concern is
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh is with respect to the assessment
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
um i mean uh a gal
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
is is assigned
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
however if a gao requested assessment
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
that assessment wouldn't happen
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
if there was a previous one done in
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
three years my understanding is that
 
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:00.950 align:start position:0%
three years my understanding is that
there's

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
assessments happen has life change you
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
know has
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
issues change um there's an assessment
 
00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.270 align:start position:0%
issues change um there's an assessment
done

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
nothing you know everything is fine
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh the child's been abused there's
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
another assessment done
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh so my recall though i i i mean this
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
would be more palatable
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
if it were for family adoptions i i
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely get that
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
um but i do have an assessment i i do
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
have an issue with
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
um you know waving assessments after you
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
know if there was one done in previous
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative long
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
um so in this bill
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
all we're talking about is whether or
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
not the court
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
may waive the assessment it is not
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
required to waive the assessment
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so this is just giving the option to
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
to say this is not required in this
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
instance and obviously
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
if the court believes that it's required
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
then it has
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
every um it's completely within its
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
power to require
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
such a assessment and so i
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
i will vote be voting for this bill
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair um
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
i so the the concerns
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
here is not
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
where we're this this bill is specific
 
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:35.829 align:start position:0%
where we're this this bill is specific
to

00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
assessment um it's in the in line five
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
it says the court
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
may proceed to a hearing it doesn't say
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
the court has to
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
gives them does give them the option to
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
deny the waiver
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
and they would have to provide an
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
example as to why they they did
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
chose to not do that and then it gives
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
them either of the following
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
circumstances so either option
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
a or option b if an assessment has been
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
completed in the previous three years it
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
gives it there is an assessment that
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
already has been completed
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
so they are able to use that assessment
 
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.309 align:start position:0%
so they are able to use that assessment
um

00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
you know it's a little disheartening to
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
hear uh why this
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
this this obvious bill that helps
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
streamline the process
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
for families um is gonna come out um
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
not to pass excuse me it would not come
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
out consent but i'm to be
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
voting yes and i urge everyone to vote
 
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:26.630 align:start position:0%
voting yes and i urge everyone to vote
yes

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
as these concerns are addressed in other
 
00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.589 align:start position:0%
as these concerns are addressed in other
rsas

00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to clarify where my vote
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
is coming from
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
for the record is that when we were um
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
we were all about this and were very
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
making this change but during testimony
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
we heard that there was concern
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh from agencies that work with the
 
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.510 align:start position:0%
uh from agencies that work with the
families

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
that the space and the amendment um line
 
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:00.870 align:start position:0%
that the space and the amendment um line
eight

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
parents of the minor are deceased when a
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
parent um
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
when a family member self-places
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
that there may not have been a
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
um an assessment done on their home
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
or their appropriateness
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
and so adding you know
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
taking line 11 and adding the word
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
and instead of or was something that i
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
think we all thought was going to happen
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
so that we could get behind this so
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
while this is a really really great idea
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
that would streamline
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
were it written um in a way that the
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
agencies who actually have to do this
 
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.309 align:start position:0%
agencies who actually have to do this
work

00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
um could could work with and
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
i think we all would have been behind it
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate the work done so far and
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
um just wish that we had been able to
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
take it over the finish line with those
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
very very minor changes but without that
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i cannot
 
00:56:01.359 --> 00:56:07.190 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i cannot
support

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
okay is there any further discussion
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative your hand is up
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i i definitely uh
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
understand that this is trying to just
 
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.069 align:start position:0%
understand that this is trying to just
uh

00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
create more of a streamlined uh
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
situation um in the law and
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
that the the change that
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
representative elshiller just mentioned
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
considered in the law and so i think
 
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.230 align:start position:0%
considered in the law and so i think
that

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
that change um should be its own bill
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
and we should have a discussion on
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
that policy um addition to
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh adoptions and increasing barriers to
 
00:56:59.839 --> 00:57:00.470 align:start position:0%
uh adoptions and increasing barriers to
adoption

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
adoption
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
is the right choice and so that's why if
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
i would not have supported such an
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
and so i i don't agree with uh
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
with the representative statement that
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
we would have all been in agreement if
 
00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:14.789 align:start position:0%
we would have all been in agreement if
that

00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
if that change was made so thank you
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative belanger uh thank you
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair so i just want to
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
draw attention to rsa 461-8
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
16 which pertains to guardian of items
 
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.829 align:start position:0%
16 which pertains to guardian of items
um

00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
there it outlines a huge and i'm not
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
going to read it because
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
i want to make this quick but it
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
outlines a huge
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
area where a guardian nut litem may
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
provide a report to the court
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
which could potentially have an impact
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
on an adoption a guardian at latime is
 
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.150 align:start position:0%
on an adoption a guardian at latime is
appointed

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
at every adoption so
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is strictly
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
for assessments it reduces it from three
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
years to two years
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
so even if we weren't if changing
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
this and we just were adding lines seven
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
through eight
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
and left line 11 at three years and
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
chose to add and
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
then it still would make it more
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
difficult for families which is not
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
currently in practice now
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
do you have more no
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%

01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
i'm a veteran i understand the time
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
things that may be very difficult for
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
some veterans however
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
um they're disabled veterans um
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
are based upon their ability to take
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
care of their family and themselves not
 
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:13.910 align:start position:0%
care of their family and themselves not
just

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
the veteran himself and i appreciate
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the federal government has not been
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
generous to the people who have served
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
our country
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
however it is not our business
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
to be trying to say that some people
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
will not have to pay child support and
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
others will the past laws for everyone
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
and this law is for
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh will be for everyone and it is not
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate in my opinion
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i mean i'd just like to say that
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
the evidence that we received is
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
a problem that we're really having i
 
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
think some things
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
are being uh confused
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
as to what um you know we we do
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
but honestly this this bill
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
is not gonna fix anything
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest so is there any
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%

01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh yeah this this um this study
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
is an effort with which to um
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
get information that we need during our
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
hearings on specific bills uh
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
has it as it relates to the uh circuit
 
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.470 align:start position:0%
has it as it relates to the uh circuit
court

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
um so retaining this i you know i
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
i i think we may be able to get an
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
agreement i know
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
about three terms ago there was a clerk
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
who was assigned to the committee and
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
we'd ask questions and they'd
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
they'd go do a random poll of 25 or 10
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
percent and give us that number
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
and it was it was just very helpful uh
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
so i think in retention we may be able
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
to work with mr head now
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh to see whether or not that can be
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
done so
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
um supporting the
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
it also fills a boy in the first part of
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
the statute of
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 458 16. with
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
such uh conditions and limitations as

such uh conditions and limitations as
the

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 494 does not interfere with
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
civil restraining orders in any way
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
um it also does not
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
interfere with domestic violence orders
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
because they represent
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
compelling government interests
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
and finally they are narrowly
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
tailored to protect victims from abuse
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
and there's no less restrictive way to
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%

representative outsiller

thank you very much madam chair um
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
so but uh what we
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
heard during testimony is that the state
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
in under none of the
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
um rsas that we have now um that relate
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
to this bill there is um there is no
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
exception to the constitution and this
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
um and all rulings are subject to review
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and the supreme court can evaluate
 
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:00.790 align:start position:0%
um and the supreme court can evaluate
and

01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
can determine if there is a basis for
 
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.149 align:start position:0%
can determine if there is a basis for
overturning

01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
overturning
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that this bill specifically um
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
particularly on lines six and seven
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh is a a procedure that would be
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
um placed upon the court so basically
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch telling the
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
judicial branch the procedures under
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
which they must
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
operate um and
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
how they must do that so
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the in the analysis it it puts
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
you put out that unless the court
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
determines there's no less restrictive
 
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.110 align:start position:0%
determines there's no less restrictive
means

01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
so that's that's actually the judge's
 
01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.149 align:start position:0%
so that's that's actually the judge's
decision

01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
to decide how restrictive
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
like the what the what the gradation of
 
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.189 align:start position:0%
like the what the what the gradation of
restriction

01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
should be um and
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
this would pull that away from their
 
01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:02.990 align:start position:0%
their decision-making process um
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:04.870 align:start position:0%
their decision-making process um
[Music]

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
so and also you know while it
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
does carve out 173 b
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes people um settle their cases
 
01:11:14.719 --> 01:11:15.430 align:start position:0%
sometimes people um settle their cases
within

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
family court in
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
lieu of not having to go through a
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence order
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
or a criminal case um there are
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know this isn't this would
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
disempower victims from
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
being able to to access um and i i just
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
has a fundamental misunderstanding about
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
um creating an exception to the
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
constitution that really isn't there
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i would hope that we
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
would give the judicial
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
branch the latitude
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
to do their job um and not micromanage
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%

and those statutes are uh basis of what
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
the court should do
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh giving the court free reign to
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
basically make up the law
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%

hard to

come to agreement i just think it's
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
harder to do
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
when we're not all together so i'm
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
really hoping that by next term we can
 
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:19.669 align:start position:0%
really hoping that by next term we can
all

01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
