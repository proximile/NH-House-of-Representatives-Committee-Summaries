bill on behalf of the counties um I I on
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
my pin card I didn't say I was either in
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
favor or opposed um I just wanted you
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
all to have a little bit of context and
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
the cont text to keep it short because
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Nickerson will dive into the
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
details is that the 11.2 million you see
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill is uh money that a a fair
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
person would argue the state owes the
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
counties uh the the issue in this budget
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
cycle though I want to tell you as the
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
chair of division three um we we have um
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh issues with coming up with enough
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
revenues to cover all the existing
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
expenses and this looks like a new
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
expense it looks like it because uh not
 
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
that it is uh but it wasn't recognized
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
in the agency budget process it's not
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
going to probably not be part of the
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
governor's budget uh the so the budget's
 
00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
going to come to division three and if
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
this requirement is in there as is we
 
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
got to find the 11 million somewhere
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
which means we're going to have to given
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
the fact that the revenues will be
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
static we're going to have to find
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
replacement money okay so um so as
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
you're listening to this and thinking
 
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
about what you're going to do with this
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
bill I just want you to be aware that
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
there's some um secondary effects
 
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
that'll be pretty significant and I just
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
would ask you to be careful as you think
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
through it and that that's really my
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't have a recommendation
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
to do it or not I want to hear what this
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee thinks but I want you to be
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
thinking it in the context of uh the
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
financial situation going into a budget
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
cycle very tough one thank you
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%

00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
monies that the state allegedly owes the
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
counties has not been budgeted for could
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
you could you explain that or is it just
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
yeah so in the prior years and Mr
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
Nickerson will tell you exactly how this
 
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
happened there was a double collection
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
on some money that was due to the county
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
and the federal portion came in as the
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
federal portion came in it was accounted
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
for um and so the the numbers are are
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
pretty good around this but um uh
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
instead of um uh advancing or or or or
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
pushing through pass through is the term
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for instead of passing
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
through the monies received for the Feds
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
that was meant for the counties it ended
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
up going into our rainy day fund so the
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
the cash is there it's in the rainy day
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
fund apparently um but as the agencies
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
and then I'm sure the governor I I hate
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
to say too much because she releases her
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
budget this week um I bet I'm betting
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
that this 11.2 million transfer from the
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
state to the counties is not in their
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
budget proposal and so because it won't
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
be in their budget proposal um it'll be
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
left to the finance committee if if you
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
all um have us pass this bill uh to to
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
find the money because it won't be
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
probably in the budget
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
So based on what you just
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
said was there some sort of a like a
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
budgeting or accounting o oversight or
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
error if you will I I don't want to um
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh describe why it's not in the budget
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
why the department didn't put it in the
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
budget I I I I if somebody's from the
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
Department they'd be in a better
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
position to answer that I I I just know
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the Practical implication when this
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
arrives on the doorstep of Finance
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
is it's probably not going to be in the
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
budget and if we want to give them the
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
not give them if we want to pass through
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
the 11 million then we're going to have
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
to find 11 million and finding 11
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
million is a lot of
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
money understood but what I was pointing
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
towards is in the previous budget the
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
fact that it wasn't the money was
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
received from the federal government it
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't passed through to the counties
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
and instead it ended up in the rainy day
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
fund that that's what I was asking like
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
what happened there why well because our
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
budgets are done in advance and they're
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
two years and and so this became I think
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh from the budgeting perspective the
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
previous term new
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
money and it just wasn't accounted for
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
in the budget that is going to expire at
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
the end of June and so I'm talking about
 
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
going forward the new budget it's
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
probably not going to the the pass
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
through probably isn't in there either
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your explanation yeah no
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I I I assume too much
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes I see that um the
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative Gerard has a
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
question I I'm hearing you're saying
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
that the 11 Point whatever the amount is
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
is not in the budget the previous two
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
years there was a 9.4 million if I
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
recall uh correctly was that not
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
budgeted for or how was that accounted
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
for the last two years that was in the
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
Rus bills uh
 
00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
previously we've budgeted money for the
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
County's share of the county cap and
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing that again this year but
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
I think this is this is incremental
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
money I don't I I'm going to I'm going
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
to ask Mr
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
Nickerson if the $9 million that the
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative is referring to was a
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
different source of funding than this
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
2225 million is
 
00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:32.029 align:start position:0%
2225 million is
isn't

00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.039 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
it why don't you note that and then when
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
when you're there in at the mic you
 
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
could um fill in thank I think it's I
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
think it's a different uh increment of
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
money thank you yeah further
 
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you all
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
right thank you sorry to share finances
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
problems with you but I it's really
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
important that we hear what you
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
think at this time the chair recognized
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
is Miss Kate
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
pile at this time the chair recognizes
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
Nickerson good morning and welcome to
 
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government good
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
morning members of the committee my name
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
is uh Charles Nickerson I'm the finance
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
director of Rockham County I'm also the
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
treasur of the Hampshire Association
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
counties and that's the organization I'm
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
representing here with my
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um just to to go back um there
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
was a letter from the president of the
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of counties
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
Kathy Stacy on that hopefully was passed
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
around to the members of the committee
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
and uh my testimony will be closely
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
following along with uh the statements
 
00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
made in that letter um I just want to
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
back up that basically counties are per
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
current state law are responsible for
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
the non-federal share of Medicaid
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
assistance to the elderly and disabled
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's services in a long-term
 
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
care facility uh such as a nursing home
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
or services that the individuals
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
receiving in the community so times you
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
hear that as Home and Community Based
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
care or choices for Independents so
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
whether it might be VNA Services Brain
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
Injury Association Services even
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
transportation services so the counties
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
by law are supposed to be only
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
responsible for that non non Federal
 
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
share of those Medicaid services that
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
represented in state law as known as the
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
so-called County cap now the federal
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
portion of covering those Medicaid
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
services is cons is called the fmap the
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
federal medical assistance percentage
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
historically that had been a 5050 split
 
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
50% federal government 50 50% counties
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
now what happened was with early
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
legislation as a result of Public Health
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
Emergency during the early days of covid
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
that um that fmap percentage increased
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
from 50 to
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
56.2 So in theory in reality the
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
County's portion should have gone down
 
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.430 align:start position:0%
County's portion should have gone down
to

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
43.8 going from 50% down to 43.8 is not
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
just a 6.2% difference it's a
 
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.430 align:start position:0%
just a 6.2% difference it's a
12.4%

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
12.4%
 
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
reduction now now again the going back
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
to the county caps the county caps are
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
established through the budget process
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
as far as dollar amounts so I can see
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
easily how because of the budgetary
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
process the state could not account for
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
this increase in the fmap UPF front it
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
just can't and I could understand
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
legislatively that it'd be hard to get
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
these amounts into the budget as well
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
and so briefly touched upon the $9
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
million that was actually an incorrect
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
amount incorrect calc calculation that
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
was provided and it got dropped during
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
the budget process so even though it's
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
in statute if you go under the law it
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
was never truly enacted at all it got in
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
a way left off from the ultimate budget
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
that was passed now the real numbers are
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
actually quite a bit higher and I will
 
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
say that DHHS did work with the state to
 
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.039 align:start position:0%
make sure that the counties were made
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
whole for this increase in the fmap
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
basically starting from 71 of 21 forward
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
but that still left the first 18 months
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
of this increase in the fmap that
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
basically DHHS double collected for that
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
12.4% of claims from the counties
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
through payments of a county cap that
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
was not subsequently adjusted and also
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
collected you know collected the
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
56.2% instead of 50% from the federal
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
government and as a result over it might
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
seem improbable but when you're talk
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
about a county cap that can be 1201 130
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
million 12.4% is a big big difference
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
over 18 months and the HHS actually has
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
the actual number for that 18 months at
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
over 25 million not 22 and a half I
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
think if you take the credit that's been
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
years and so we're just asking for
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
basically in hindsight for the law to be
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
followed and for um only the Count's
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
being responsible for the non-federal
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
share and we are asking for the credit
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
over two years because this occurred
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
over two years and again we're
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
understandable about the the whole
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
budget process the legislative process
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
things thank you are there
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gerard thank
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you Mr nickers
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um one question I
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
had was in paragraphs three and four it
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
always talked about six it was accounted
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
for for patients that were 65 and older
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why paragraphs 5 and
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
six do not reference being 65 and
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
older um because it is not so this is
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
also assistance for the disabled so it's
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that you're just it's
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's Bas as far well I think they're
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
rebranding themselves but um so it's
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
assistance the elderly and disabled so
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
it's not just necessarily the those that
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
are over 65 but is individuals that are
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid that are receiving services
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
in the community or in a nursing
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
facility thank
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative majori thank
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
you madam chair women to thank you for
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question and being here to
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
testify if if this if this bill were to
 
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
pass and indeed the money is not
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
available are we obligated to find it or
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
could It Go unpaid and if so what would
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
happen well I I guess the the issue is
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
what the law of states the law of states
 
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
the counties are responsible for the
 
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.750 align:start position:0%
the counties are responsible for the
nonfederal

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
nonfederal
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
share so if if the state wants to comply
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
with the law then that's what this this
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
bill allows for that after the fact for
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
the state to be in compliance with the
 
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
law and again the actual amount is is a
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
bit higher but the request is not to
 
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
adjust what's in the proposed bill um as
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
far as impacts if it's not I mean
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
obviously it means you know already that
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
the counties have taken more of a uh
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
actual results hit that they should have
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
or the first 18 months and I again I
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
fully understand the state could not
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
accommodate you know because again
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
through the different processes that we
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
have budgetary and legislative and also
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
who knew how long the public health
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
emergency was going to last because
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's what this increase in the federal
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
medical assistance percentage was tied
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
to so I understand why it did not happen
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
upfront I understand why it didn't
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
happen a year or even two years after
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
you know this situation was occurring
 
00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
But Here we are now and it's still not
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
rectified at least in the eyes of the
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
counties additional
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you right
 
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.909 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you right
thank

00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
you so that that is the final pink card
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
that we have for House Bill
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
547 so at this time I will ask is there
 
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
anyone present who wishes to speak on
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
the bill who has not yet had the
 
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
so okay seeing none the chair recognizes
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
sheets thank you madam chair on the uh
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
remote signin we had two in support and
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
five oppos
 
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
post and the paper sheets coming
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
somebody down that and should report
 
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.990 align:start position:0%
somebody down that and should report
that

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
one ready yeah excellent there is no one
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
on the blue
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
sheet thank you and with that the public
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:17.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
oh WR that
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
okay at this time the chair will open
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
569 relative to the establishment of
 
00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
districts the chair recognizes
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Howard to introduce the
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill welcome to Municipal and County
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
government good morning good morning
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh and thank you
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members thank you
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
for having me this morning uh HB 569 is
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
all about governmental efficiency in
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
establishing Communications districts uh
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
this would give counties the power to uh
 
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
enable themselves uh to create these
 
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
districts which if you aren't aware
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
Communications districts are basically
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
the banding together of
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh in order to create a
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh a more um compelling uh contract for
 
00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:16.519 align:start position:0%
uh different uh Communications uh
 
00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
providers and that means people who
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
would provide are internet
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
services uh so there a number of
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
economic advantages to establishing
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
districts uh at the size of a County due
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
to the economies of scale because there
 
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:30.919 align:start position:0%
needs to be enough subscribers in order
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
to make it economically viable it is
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
cheaper for everyone involved if there
 
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
are more municipalities because it
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
expands the potential scri subscriber
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
base uh there are of course costs
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
included in this but that would be taken
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
up by each individual County and the
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
individual subscribers that would choose
 
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
to buy into this uh it is something
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
where it this is only enabling
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislation so it doesn't actually uh
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily deal with any sort of uh
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
local Establishment Clause but in terms
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
of the economic opportunities uh if we
 
00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:07.519 align:start position:0%
look at uh places like Chattanooga
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
Tennessee that have implemented similar
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
Broadband infrastructure they have seen
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh their EBP Network create $2.69
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
billion doar and brought in nearly
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
10,000 jobs to the city so that's a lot
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
of economic growth and we can see that
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire as
 
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
well so just for people who are unaware
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
last session this bill did C come
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
forward and there was a little bit of
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
debate as to whether or not counties
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
actually already had the power to do
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
this uh today I've actually brought some
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh a letter from the straford county
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
attorney talking about uh H RSA
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
53g and its ability to be used by County
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh Commissioners and currently under her
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law we cannot
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
currently do that I can send that the
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
her email Emil around because I only
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
have the one copy uh that I did bring
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
today uh so I do apologize about that
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
but as for uh the current enabling
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
structure municipalities they have to
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
individually go to each select board and
 
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
say do you want to join it makes it
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
unbelievably difficult to get one of
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
these districts established it would be
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
a lot simpler and make a lot more sense
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
the economies of scale if the County
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners could just invite the
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
towns in the county to come and say do
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
you want to join this and then allow
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
them the option to opt out with that
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
being said uh I think that I've covered
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
everything that this bill does and uh
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions for
 
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.789 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions for
representative

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you madam chairman and
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh testifying
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
today are there any counties that are
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
currently voluntarily
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh forming these districts so uh there
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
is already one grafting County but not
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
all of the communities in grafting
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
County have and that was part of the
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
reason last session that there was this
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
debate because uh the Grafton County uh
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
Communications District was established
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
by local communities within Grafton
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
County uh cooperating together not the
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners inviting everybody
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
to look into studying whether or not
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
this would be a good idea
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.590 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
Colby

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
Colby
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
would would this disallow certain
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
communities to continue with their
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
current benefits that's are in their
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
contracts no this this does not change
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
any current established districts it
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
only changes the establishment uh or uh
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
of how uh these districts could be
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
established so it only affect new
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
you additional
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman is
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to follow up on
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
representative Colby's question if uh
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
three or more communities have
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
agreements with let's say comp Comcast
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
and are funding their uh local TV
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
um fees charges
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
is um would joining a county
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
then disperse those funds amongst the
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
towns or are there still a contract with
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
each town I believe there would still be
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
a contract with each town and depending
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
on what that contract stated uh whether
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
there was an exclusivity Clause they
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
could opt out of the countywide district
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh so that would not necessarily
 
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
interfere with that secondly it would
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
actually probably reduce rates for
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
everybody if these municipalities
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
decided to join because when you have a
 
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
larger district with more subscribers
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:08.919 align:start position:0%
lower representative Gerard has a
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
know this is part of the previous bill
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
it talks about governing body of two or
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
more municipalities but then it says at
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
least two persons per municipality when
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
you start getting into a county you're
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
going to have a committee of 100 people
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
that are going to be required and it
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
also talks about may be reimbursed how
 
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
is that all going to take place and
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't you think that maybe a 100 person
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
committee might be a little difficult to
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
deal with as well yeah I I appreciate
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
the question uh yeah there was actually
 
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
a clause in the uh Bill last term that
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
actually reduced the number uh of uh
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
members from counties if the if it was
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
established to their County to only be
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
one member uh so that was removed
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
because obviously that would create two
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
different class
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to kind of avoid that um
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
if that's something that you feel would
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
be beneficial I would be more than happy
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
to bring that back in thank you
 
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
questions I I just had had a
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
clarification so to be clear this this
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
bill your amended language to to the RSA
 
00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.589 align:start position:0%
bill your amended language to to the RSA
is

00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
enabling a a county to establish a
 
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.669 align:start position:0%
enabling a a county to establish a
committee

00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
committee known as of the communications
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
District planning committee so that's
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
the first step this is not this bill is
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
is not in
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
initially um establishing this
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
Communications District that's that
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
would be the goal down the road and yes
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
also if and when it came to establishing
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
a Communications District
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
um min municipalities that were not
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
interested in participating May opt out
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear this is about
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
explore the possibility the pluses
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
minuses of
 
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
minuses of
um

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
creating a Communications District yes
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
ex exactly that's the first step you
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
look at creating a study committee you
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
look at all the pros and cons to whether
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
or not it would be a good idea uh and
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
then uh of course municipalities can opt
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
out at any point uh and choose whether
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
or not they want to uh stay with their
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
current contracts or move into uh
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
Communications District so uh I like you
 
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:44.839 align:start position:0%
said it is only enabling language and
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
does not change anything uh for
 
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
currently established districts uh so it
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
it will make it so that there will only
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
be a uh study committee formed first and
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
then they can look at whether or not
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
they want to actually form the full
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
District thank
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
you any additional questions seeing none
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
much next the chair recognizes Mr Brody
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
Des good morning and welcome to

morning thank you madam chairwoman and
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee for taking my
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Brody Dees I
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm speaking in
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
569 um our biggest piece of opposition
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
is as general principle um legislation
 
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
like this should be opt in
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities and their governing body
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
should be determining whether or not
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
they opt into this planning process for
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
a Communications District planning
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
committee and I appreciate that the
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
chairwoman pointed out that this is a
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
planning committee so it's not the
 
00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599 align:start position:0%
establishment of the communications
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
District you'll notice in section four
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill it actually kind of
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
describes after bylaws or um what
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
um that there's a proposed District
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
agreement which often times takes the
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
form of bylaws that are created as I do
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
the planning process and then there is a
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
requirement for there to be a
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
presentation each municipality and then
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
actually the legislative bodies need to
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
approve whether or not the municipality
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
joins a Communications District but this
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
is for the communications District
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
planning committee and we don't think
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
that the county should be the
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um establishing these
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
planning committees and then requiring
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
each municipality have to opt out if
 
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
they don't want to join there are
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
already existing um uh Communications
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
districts that were born naturally from
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
the planning committees um one in Carol
 
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
County there's one in Grafton County so
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
there's two currently that are operating
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and they've been able to organize and
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
to do all of this without having the
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners mandate that the
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities decide whether or not to
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
join the municipalities have banded
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
together I do want to point out just as
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
a um another General as side is that
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op has been
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
building out its um its Broadband
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and so a lot of the
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
reasons why communities are creating
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
these um these communication districts
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
is because they want to procure grant
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
funding and they want to procure um uh
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know build you know um economies of
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
scale uh for building out uh Broadband
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so in some cases your
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
municipality probably doesn't want to
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
join because you're essentially waiting
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
over the next you know anywhere from 2
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
to 5 years for the nire Electric Co-op
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
to build out that infrastructure there
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
is some benefits for negotiating
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
contracts um however you know I won't I
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
don't know too too much about that but I
 
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
do know that there is benefits to that
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
so um again as general principle though
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
we don't think that the county should be
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
requiring the governing bodies to have
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
to take action on a Communications
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
District that instead it should be the
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
governing bodies naturally working
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
together and organically establishing
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
these planning uh districts and not
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
coming from the counties uh so with that
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any questions thank you Mr
 
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.750 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any questions thank you Mr
Des

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
you and the final pink card that I have
 
00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:17.079 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 569 is from Mr or
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
mcis yep you can give it to
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
you so good morning and welcome to
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
government good morning Madam chair and
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
members of the municipal County
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
government committee my name is George
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
mcgis I'm president of New Hampshire
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner's Council a position
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
I've held for the last 27 years or so uh
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm here in support of House Bill 6 56
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
9 which is simply an enabling act uh
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
that allows uh counties to create
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
commiss communication districts if they
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
so choose and it gets and eliminates
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
some of the ambiguity in the present
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
law now I can understand the the
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding the municipal
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
Association they assume that they don't
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
want the count is BAS basically telling
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
the communities what to do and I get
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
that however not all counties are the
 
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.510 align:start position:0%
that however not all counties are the
same

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
and as an example in my County I have
 
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.150 align:start position:0%
and as an example in my County I have
three

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
cities those three cities often reach
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
out to the county and ask the county to
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
deal with problems that they have that
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
they can't do on their
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
own so it has just the opposite effect
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
so you have some counties that want some
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that want the
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
counties to
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
participate on problems that they have
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh the the latest W and straford county
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
is an example is dealing with a homeless
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
issue no municipality is capable of
 
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:03.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with homelessness on their
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
own uh and because we have three cities
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
that are within 10 miles of each other
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh they've asked the county to act on
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
their behalf to deal with a homeless
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
issue so
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh I think you ought to make this piece
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
of legislation in your wisdom as as as
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
flexible as possible uh enable the
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
counties to operate allow the
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities to op in or
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
out uh they can do that by contract and
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
by or
 
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
byou uh it would also help some of the
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
more rural sections of our state the
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
more rural counties to be able to work
 
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.069 align:start position:0%
more rural counties to be able to work
uh

00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
collaboratively uh for any type of
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that would be deemed in
 
00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:50.150 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that would be deemed in
their

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
interest uh and and the consumer's
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
interest and I think that's what the
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the legislation is trying
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
trying to uh achieve so with that I'll
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you commissioner mcis
 
00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman is
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
question if this
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
passes um how do you see the
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
organization of it happening um you know
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
a central body versus well each Town
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
talking to itself versus well I think
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
that it if if it was handled in in the
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
way it ought to be handled which is have
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
the County Commissioners extend if they
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
so choose uh an invitation to the
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have a planning
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
Communications uh and I don't
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
particularly think it ought to be uh I
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
think that's just a good idea generally
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
speaking I just think it's good public
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
policy to have that happen uh it's not
 
00:42:59.069 --> 00:42:59.079 align:start position:0%
using a heavy hand it's just enabling
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
every people to have to act in
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
cooperation with one
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
another sometimes you'll find that uh
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
many small towns have a parochial
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
attitude and they want to keep
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
everything to themselves uh which works
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
in in some cases but it doesn't work in
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
all cases for instance you don't want
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
every town running its own jail for a
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
varying number of reasons you don't want
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
their your own town to uh run its own
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
nursing home as an example first of all
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make economic sense uh and so
 
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
I see it as more of I think it more in a
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
positive light is is to have the County
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners if they so choose set up
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh by invitation to the towns uh a
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
planning committee to
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
study uh whether or not it's in our
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
their interest generally speaking and
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
maybe out of that comes uh Cooperative
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
efforts between communities
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily the county maybe the
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
county won't be involved but it's it's a
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
way to get everyone talking to one
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
another and then uh they may may they
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
may come up with collaboratives on their
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
own uh similar to what we do with school
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
example representative J Gerard is
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair and
 
00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:20.839 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner for taking my
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
question from what I just heard what you
 
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
stated that you're actually not opposed
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
to what nhma it stated in his testimony
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
that you're okay with an optin or opt
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
out method so either work well for you
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
questions I have a couple okay so um on
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
line seven of of the bill I I would like
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
to um point out right
 
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
that this is with regards to a
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
Communications District
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
planning committee cor and then if you
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
look at section four of the bill is this
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
this is the correct understanding is
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
that the planning um committee would
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
would um be uh
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
initiated by the County however once
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
that study committee is complete and
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
there are uh municipalities within that
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
County that are interested in coming
 
00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:27.510 align:start position:0%
County that are interested in coming
together

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
it the step thereafter is as it is right
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
now it it's it's commun it's
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities forming this
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
Communications district is that correct
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's how I understand it that's
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
correct thank you any other questions
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
and if I make one other point to you to
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
your your point Madam chair is that is
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
that you may find as a result of that
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
planning that they want the county
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
involved in some form of
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
and they may want to contract with the
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
county to do it simply because it makes
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
sense from an economic perspective uh
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
that happens uh on a number on a number
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
of different things because counties are
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
are a little different even though we
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
have the same basic services that are
 
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
required by Statute some counties run
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
different Services uh at the request of
 
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.710 align:start position:0%
different Services uh at the request of
municipalities

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
so it could go either way you could then
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
you you could probably as a result of
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
your planning your Planning
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
Commission uh they may make a
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation where you have say five
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
five towns in a particular County that
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
want to work uh with in a Cooperative
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
effort and the county would be out of it
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
they would those five towns would get
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
together but to me it's just it all just
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense for everybody to try to get
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
together and and at least start the
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
initial planning process and and see how
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
it develops it wouldn't be any any
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
situation where the county would demand
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
anything of the towns or
 
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
cities thank you um further questions
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner so at this time I will ask
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
is there anyone present who wishes to
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill who has not yet had
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do so um seeing none
 
00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes representative
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%

wanted to share some observations on
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
this bill with you from my perspective
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
and uh from what I can tell there was no
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh needs analysis done uh by the author
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh what it does do has add
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
two more positions expanding big
 
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.230 align:start position:0%
two more positions expanding big
government

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily costing the taxpayers of
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
my County $40,000 more in taxes every
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
year this is at a time when uh our real
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
estate taxes are already ridiculously
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
high and may even go higher with uh you
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
know what's happening with the budget
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
cuts at the state
 
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.829 align:start position:0%
cuts at the state
level

00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
Here the uh non partisan Association of
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire counties uh scoffed at
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
this bill uh and of the 26
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives that are in our County
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
not a single one has co-sponsored it uh
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
this bill serves from what I can tell no
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate purpose uh is a waste of
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
resources and a waste of time for the uh
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
committee and uh does not make sense uh
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of New Hampshire and uh
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
out with a population of n roughly
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%
94,000 uh as you know to win your seats
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
it requires the majority of a 3,000
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
votes um for commissioner level 30,000
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
for my level it's 990,000 constituents I
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
have to reach in that Geographic vast
 
00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
Turf with very little media coverage
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're generally swamped with the general
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
election wave of partisan mailings and
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see historically the undervote at
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner level is is very high
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
percentile because it's at the bottom of
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
the ballot and quite frankly many of our
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
citizens have no idea what the County
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
Commissioners do as you know the
 
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
delegation's responsible for the uh the
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
budget but the annual budget
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
what the Commissioners are responsible
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
for is policy decisions and those are
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
the invisible underlying decisions that
 
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.670 align:start position:0%
the invisible underlying decisions that
drive

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
drive
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
costs when you have people that are are
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
not connected to the local community and
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce they make decisions based on
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
their political ideology and not in the
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
best interest of the county I do not
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
consider myself a politician I'm an
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
independent thinker and I've reached out
 
00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:20.799 align:start position:0%
to my constituents who pay the
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
bills we are blessed with great tourism
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
scenery that's a high utilization of the
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
current use progam program Dartmouth
 
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
College Plymouth State University
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River me many lakes and
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
great utilization is set of the current
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
use system for hunting and farming and
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
two ski mountains and snowmobile trails
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful draw but the actual
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
citizen working and living there is
 
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
being burdened with unbelievable
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
increases as the registered Deeds I've
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
seen a wave of people come into graphin
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
County through covid and it's not what
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
you think it is it's people Looking For
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
Freedom and peace and some space so I
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
really do believe that the the
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
demographics are shifting and with the
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
centralized College locations oh The
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
Forbidden college student vote that we
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
even discuss this specifically if
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
affects the commissioner level vote to
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
divide that up I think this is a good
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
idea I'm sorry there's not more support
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
for it because dividing up our towns to
 
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
their interests of their people just at
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
the county level would go a great way at
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
their voices being heard
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
and I have many more points I can say
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to wrap it up and just take
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
any questions you have thank you for
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you all
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
much on the fiscal note if I
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
may uh you can divide that what they're
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
currently spending by five since they're
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
covering Five Towns instead of three so
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be an increase other than
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
the mileage which should there should be
 
00:54:57.309 --> 00:54:57.319 align:start position:0%
oversight on that mileage thank you
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
next the chair recognizes Miss headed
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
Hedberg good morning and welcome to
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
government good morning and thank you
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and honorable
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
Meers members of the committee thank you
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak today my name
 
00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:19.799 align:start position:0%
is Katie wood Hedberg and I'm the
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
Grafton County Commissioner from
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
District 3 and I'm here today to speak
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill the bottom
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
line is that this bill does not benefit
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
the county nor the citizens it also
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
increases County spending by about
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
$40,000 per year when it goes into
 
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
effect this is money the county can ill
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
afford to put towards such an
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
unprecedented unnecessary change looking
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
at some specifics it proposes to
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
redistrict outside of the traditional
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
process which can be confusing to
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
voters the new districts appear to be
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
drawn by geographical size with no
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
attention to population these districts
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
are very disperate in population size um
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
ranging by rough estimates from only
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
about 7,000 citizens to over
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
30,000 on close reading of the bill
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
permont one of our towns is not even
 
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
included in a district Grafton County
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
like the majority of New Hampshire
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
counties has adopted a rotating
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
four-year term to assure some continuity
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
with the board this has worked quite
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
well and I disagree with a proposal to
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
return to two-year terms some
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge is imperative
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
for efficient management of any
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
organization knowing the history of
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
County initiatives both what was
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
successful and what fell short of the
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
stated goal prevents repeating mistakes
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue it's a
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
strategy for Effective and efficient
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
government again I oppose the bill and
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
attention so before I forget you you've
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
indicated that that you do have written
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
testimony yeah I have one copy okay I I
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
can get copies of that if you pass that
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
along at at the end and if you want to
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Walker
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
currently Grafton has what's your terms
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
foure terms um we um the out of the
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners there's two two-year
 
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
terms and one four-year term and so um
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
in this past election I was in District
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
three and I ran for a two-year term
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
district one didn't run she was in the
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
middle of a four-year term and District
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
Two um ran for a four-year term so this
 
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:51.559 align:start position:0%
means that there's two um there'll be
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
two new people but one person will
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
continue for a 4-year term to per
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
provide some stability and continuity
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you eight of the counties in um
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
the set of terms of a rotating four-year
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%

number of of County Commissioners from 3
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
to five and redistrict the entire County
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
um it's unprecedented to do this and
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
they don't see a need to make the change
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
or we don't really um this would be
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
outside the normal uh traditional
 
00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
redistricting process so create a bit of
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
confusion for Grafton County can you
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
hear me yeah okay sorry um in addition
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
it eliminates the rotating four-year
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
term that was adopted just recently so
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
as commissioner Hedberg mentioned um our
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
folks from the southern part are already
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
in a four-year term I was just elected
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
for a four-year term I had served a
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
two-year term before that and then the
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
Plymouth area would be moving to a
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
four-year term uh in two years uh we
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
joined seven other counties and doing
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
this and it is to ensure continuity to
 
01:00:17.789 --> 01:00:17.799 align:start position:0%
the Board of Commissioners and is seeing
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
the benefits of this um addition to the
 
01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
board so we uh the association would
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote this bill an
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate uh if you have
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
additional questions I can certainly
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
answer county level um but uh Kate Horan
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
is available to answer any of uh New
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions and I have her testimony here
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
and then I did want to mention as uh
 
01:00:43.029 --> 01:00:43.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hedberg said that Pont is
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
missing from a district 2 one of my
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
communities or my towns uh that I
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
represent uh and then uh I don't have a
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
whole lot more to add so I don't want to
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
do uh do that for you but I did grew up
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
in Grafton County I live in the house I
 
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
grew up in in frankc conia I graduated
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
from Littleton High School um I know the
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
county quite well um we're a real
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation County as well as a
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
agricultural County along the river so
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
participating in hiking skiing and in
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
the 4 group as a young person um and so
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
I really don't see that this necessary
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
to expand the number of um Commissioners
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
to five I'm not sure that it really is
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
necessary to do that particularly in the
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
way that they have it in this piece oops
 
01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um and our frankly our
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
our County delegation has not asked for
 
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
doing this and I think you all know as
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
members of the county delegation you
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
have that oversight over the
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner's budget uh and so that's
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
it seems to work quite well for us as it
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
is so I would ask you to um uh expedient
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
to legislate a recommendation on this
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and if you have any
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none and you'll pass
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
around I pass around the New Hampshire
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
Association of counties and then I'll
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
sign in remotely and put some my remarks
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
into your um online okay and also if you
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
want um you had written test did you
 
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
have written testimony of your own I
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't I just have it from the uh New
 
01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:20.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association perfect thank you
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
Phillips good morning and welcome to
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
government thank you madam chair and
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh my
 
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
name is Paul Phillips I'm a um homeowner
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
in Plymouth I'm a business owner in
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
Littleton uh and I'm a voter and
 
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in Grafton County I'm here to
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
oppose HB
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
643 uh this bill is a solution looking
 
01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
for a non-existent problem the voters in
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
Grafton County haven't asked for and
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
don't need any Midstream redistricting
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
and we certainly we certainly don't need
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
to increase the number of County
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and districts from three
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
to five uh these unnecessary changes
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
will put an additional $40,000 per year
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
on Grafton County
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh currently the Grafton
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners serve two-year
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
terms with one commissioner each cycle
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
serving a four-year term on a rotating
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
basis this system has provided stability
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
and continuity for County Commissioners
 
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh for a County Commission that has seen
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
regular turnover of its members uh HB
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
643 would do away with this local
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
solution and replace it with a conquered
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
solution strict uniformity in the
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
two-year terms but adding more districts
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
more Commissioners and more costs to
 
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
County government if the drafters of
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
this Bill had any interest in what the
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
voters of Grafton County actually wanted
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
they would put these question questions
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
on every town meeting warrant in Grafton
 
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
County and let the people decide if they
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
support these changes instead this bill
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
would impose a set of confusing and
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary election changes on Grafton
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
County halfway through a 10-year
 
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
redistricting cycle uh solely to serve
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
political goals and not to serve the
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
people of Grafton County the proposed
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
new districts have no basis in
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
population numbers or Community cohesion
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
fully onethird of Grafton County's
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
population would be inexplicably
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
shoehorn into one of the five new
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
election districts this is not a
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
redistricting plan based on fairness but
 
01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
only on political manipulation the
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
clearest evidence that the drafters uh
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
offer this proposal without concern for
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
the voters and communities of Grafton
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
county is that the new election
 
01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:45.799 align:start position:0%
districts completely omit the town of
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
permont that one glaring glaring error
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
alone should be enough to kill this bill
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
and some I oppose HB 643 and I urge you
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
all to vote against it
 
01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:58.839 align:start position:0%

mention a couple of things to you folks
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then I'm going to sit
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
down uh I served on this committee
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
almost 50 years ago I was a member of
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
the minan County government
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee back then when we had changes
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
to be made to
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
County government in terms of the County
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it was always a decision
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
by the county delegation the delegation
 
01:05:55.839 --> 01:05:56.510 align:start position:0%
by the county delegation the delegation
would

01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
meet and uh and look through things like
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
creating districts and four-year terms
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
and all these things and the delegation
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
then would would sponsor a bill uh to
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
change the way things are done in their
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
County and that was always
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
recognized uh by the
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
legislature and I can name you I've been
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
a county commissioner now for 21 terms I
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
can name you dozens and dozens of
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
instances where particular counties
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a certain thing in their
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
County uh but it was the county
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
delegation that made that decision
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
collectively in recent years we're
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
seeing these these bills that are that
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
are politically
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
motivated uh that didn't get the proper
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
political airing in the best term of the
 
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
word by the county delegation and this
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
is the case with what happened in
 
01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
Grafton this particular bill it seems to
 
01:06:58.109 --> 01:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
me that the delegation if we want to do
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
if history is any teacher and usually
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
history is a very good
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
teacher that the delegation should meet
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
on a on a proposal like this and air it
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
out themselves and then make a
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
determination as to how they wish to
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
govern their particular
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
County have legislation like this crop
 
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
up every these things have cropped up
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
over the years many many times uh they
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
usually don't gain any traction uh for
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
that very reason so I wanted to bring
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
that to your attention because that's
 
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
how we used to do it 50 years ago when I
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
was here and uh I didn't think it was a
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
bad practice uh and I think that
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
practice should continue thank you madam
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
chair thank you commissioner mlar
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
questions representative Walker is
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question yes
 
01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
um how many uh does most counties in the
 
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire have three
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
Commissioners how many have more than
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
three nobody has more than three okay
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
they all have three that's what I
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
figured and that that was decided in
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
1856 uh when Commissioners positions
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
were created by
 
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
Statute uh they did
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
that those folks back then did it Bas
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
Bas basing it
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
on a Selectmen type of government that
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
they had in towns having three Selectmen
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
in most towns uh they decided that not
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
to have one commissioner uh
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
there was arguments as to having the
 
01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:30.950 align:start position:0%
there was arguments as to having the
executive

01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
counselor uh elect a number of executive
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
councils have that executive counsel act
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner for each County they
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
had multiple debates about this for many
 
01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
many years but anyway they ended up they
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
ended up uh creating three Commissioners
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
similar to what they have in Towns at
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
the time now some towns have changed now
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
we have town councils and things like
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
that it's all evolved but initially you
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have that uh because because of
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's distrust of
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
power um any the executive granch that's
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
why we have one of the weakest governors
 
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
in the country with with an executive
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
counsel who act as a check on the
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
governor uh same thing with County
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
government nothing can happen unless you
 
01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
get two Commissioners to agree to it and
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's all because of our distrust of
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
government thank you for that
 
01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
interesting history I appreciate it
 
01:09:18.759 --> 01:09:20.189 align:start position:0%
interesting history I appreciate it
further

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman has a
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh I have
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
this committee has seen several bills
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
where different counties want want to be
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
treated differently and my question to
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
you is will you work with me over the
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
summer to see if we can straighten some
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
up yeah I would be more than happy to do
 
01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.510 align:start position:0%
up yeah I would be more than happy to do
that

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh I I I hate to say this but I'm going
 
01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
to say it because it's the
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
truth at the end of this term I'll have
 
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
been in public office 50 years
 
01:09:59.790 --> 01:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
years every one of these bills that I
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
have seen over that course of
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
time were mostly political
 
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
vendettas matter of fact 95% of them
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
were political
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
vendettas and we used to pride ourselves
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
and recognize that as as such years
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
ago in recent years we weaponized the
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
system against
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
people which I think is is doesn't serve
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
our the population
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
well uh as a and I'm a a member of the
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
old school Democratic party which just
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
basically doesn't exist anymore I'm a ro
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
Rosevelt and Truman Democrat my family's
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
been in public office in in the city of
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
Dover I'm a former mayor of the two-term
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
mayor of the city of Dober I didn't run
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
again because I gave it up for Lent
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
but but most of these types of
 
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
legislation over the course of time were
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
political vendettas some of them
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
survived the review of the county
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
delegation and it was and and and was
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
put into
 
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
law then so I don't mind working with
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
you or with this committee on any of
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
these things I just bring some kind of
 
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
historical perspective to it because
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of new members here third
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
of you turn over every every two years
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's just that's not me talking that's
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
just reality so you you have there's not
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of institutional knowledge left
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
here anymore and so we're we're forced
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
into these into our into our own little
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
our party systems which years ago
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
although that was the case after the
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
elections that was all put aside and we
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
did what was best interest of the people
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
in the end the weaponization that we
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
have today does not serve us well and
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that for what it's
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
worth thank you further questions seeing
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
none thank you thank you so the last
 
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
pink card that I have is for
 
01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
pink card that I have is for
representative

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
Horgan good morning and welcome to
 
01:11:58.629 --> 01:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
 
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
government thank you it's good to be
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
here so I'm resident Timothy Horgan from
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
straford County District 10 which of
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
course is in straford County the town of
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
Durham and um hope I don't seem too
 
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
presumptuous for someone from straford
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
County speaking about a bill from
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
Grafton County although commissioner
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
mcis just spoke very eloquently and
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually one of the two sponsors is from
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
straford County and unlike I don't know
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
if she's ever lived in Grafton County
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
but I actually lived in Grafton County
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
for for 10 years lived in Orford and
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
then in um hover and then in in Lebanon
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
and I was even the Lebanon City chair
 
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
for two two years so I've got a little
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
bit of standing to talk about it so I
 
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
think apparently there's no local
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
interest in it so nobody's you know this
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
is something the sponsors came up on
 
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
their own and um so it's obvious there's
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
no support for it for that's one reason
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
probably not to move forward with the
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
bill and um there's and there's U also
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that they to town out the town
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
of permont the lovely town of permont
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
just north of Orford a place I know very
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
well so I'm like uh they deserve to be
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
in a county they deserve a county
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner too so um I I really don't
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of an appalling
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
mistake actually and I'm um you know the
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'm surprised that that fell
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
through the cracks I'm surprised the
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors didn't notice it I'm surprised
 
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
the drafting attorney didn't notice it
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised the sponsors didn't turn
 
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
out the draft CF in and I'm also like
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
surprised that the leadership in the
 
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
caucus that the sponsors belong to never
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
noticed it so how how that happened
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's uh and we've had some errors like
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
that including uh one which I'll be
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with dealing with later and I'm
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
just uh amazed so I'm just amazed that
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
that could have happened so as somebody
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
I haven't been in office as long as
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
represent as commissioner mcis although
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
he's we're close to the same age I've
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
only been there 17 years but still like
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
I've been here long enough been in
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
office long enough to be kind of
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
personally embarrassed that such a
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
blatant error could have fall into the
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
practice so that alone is probably that
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
that alone kind of annoys me so that's
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I S just sit down and
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
like take up two minutes of your your
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
time to uh say that I oppose the bill so
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
and if You' do want to expand the change
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
the Grafton County Commission um that
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
should be first of all that should
 
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
probably be done you know you know after
 
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
the next desial census in 2030 it should
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
be done with some you know local
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
discussion with some support from the
 
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
delegation and actually
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
ironically this particular county is
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
easier to divide into three parts than
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
any of the others because uh the
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
population is kind of most of the
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
population is down in one corner of the
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
county where Lebanon and Handover and
 
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
Enfield are and then there's uh where
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
Plymouth is is another population Center
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
and then up by uh then up in uh
 
01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
Woodsville where the county seat is
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
another population Center so actually
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
it's fairly easy to like draw three
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
districts centered on those three
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
populations um you know though it's very
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
easy actually to divide into three
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
districts based on those three
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
population centers so I would and also
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's a small County so the district
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
would be pretty small so I would proably
 
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
small population in ter of counties so
 
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
like uh You' be drawing very small
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
districts so it's probably easier to
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
have three districts that's probably of
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
all the counties that's the one that
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
probably like needs a five a larger
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner District less than
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
any others so I would just say uh itl
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
this belill and it's reason enough that
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
they left the town out I as I said I
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
can't believe that happened like what
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know what the heck so anyway that
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Horgan
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
thanks so that was the last pink card so
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
I will ask is there anybody present who
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on the bill who has not
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
yet had the opportunity to do so seeing
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
none the chair recognizes representative
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%

sheet there was one in
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
support support uh but they ended up
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
speaking to us anyway um and on the
 
01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
remote sign in there's zero in support
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
and 72
 
01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you and with that I will

close the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:32.149 align:start position:0%
 
just

01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative page do do you

01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair will open the
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 544 local
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
relative to an optional local public
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
safety assessment on certain room
 
01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
safety assessment on certain room
occupancies

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
okay so the chair recognizes
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%

morning thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
to everyone for having me and I hope
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
that everyone enjoyed the amazing snow
 
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
we had yesterday um up in the valley it
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
was my son's uh 10th birthday party so
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
we spent the whole day out in the snow
 
01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
having snowball fights having a great
 
01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
time having s'mores that on bonfire and
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
it was a great time
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I hope all of you come up for the
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
snow to the Mount Washington Valley it's
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
a beautiful place to come uh all four
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
seasons we love having visitors I don't
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
know if folks saw but earlier this
 
01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
season USA Today uh said that Conway is
 
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
America's best ski town and of course
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
those of us who live there know that
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
already but it was still a great honor
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
and it was exciting to see that
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
recognized and the next time you're up
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
in the Mount Washington Valley I hope
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
that you will enjoy it uh we love having
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
you I hope you'll also take a moment to
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
pause and think about what it takes to
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
run a town like
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
Conway and the way I think of it is we
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
kind of those of us who live in the
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington Valley it's like we
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
live simultaneously in two parallel
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
universes there's sort of one universe
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
in which we live uh you know on a weak
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
day night in April or a cold uh day in
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
November after the leaves are all gone
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
but before the snow comes where we live
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
in a really sleepy quain rural town it's
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
the town my mom grew up in it's the town
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
my granddad grew up in and it's a tiny
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
tiny Place tight-knit
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
community and then we live
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
simultaneously in this other
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
Universe which is pretty much any day in
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
the summer any holiday weekend uh a
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
powder day like we had
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday and that is a busy rockus
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
town the trouble
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
is that our population of about 10,000
 
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
people 10,000 locals
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
balloons at these different times of the
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
year so at any given point you know in
 
01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:04.639 align:start position:0%
the summer we may be a town of 40,000
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
people instead of a town of 10,000
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
people and that poses huge
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
challenges for local people because it's
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
local people who are bearing all the
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
costs of that 40,000 Town 40,000 person
 
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
town that we sustain intermittently
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
what that means is everything is super
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
sized in Conway right so we have a
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
police force that is at least twice the
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
size of what you would expect in a town
 
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
of 10,000 but it's still those same
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
10,000 locals who are sustaining that we
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
have Wastewater infrastructure that is
 
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:49.719 align:start position:0%
built to accommodate those 40,000
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
people so this is a a big problem and if
 
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
you talk to constit my constituents in
 
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
my town this is the least partisan issue
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
imagine everybody in town is on the same
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
page in this on this Democrat Republican
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
independent what we are
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
seeking are
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
tools we love our
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
visitors we love being this this
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
beautiful place uh that people come to
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
you know as my as my aunts says whenever
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're kind of like dealing with traffic
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
or any of these other annoying issues
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
that come from tourists being in town
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
she says how lucky are we that we get to
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
live in the place that everybody else
 
01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:37.719 align:start position:0%
wants to come and I do feel that way I
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
feel that way I love where we
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
live but what all my constituents want
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
from the state from us here are better
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
tools to deal with the fact that these
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
this transient population in our
 
01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639 align:start position:0%
communities is such a major driver of
 
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
costs for the town we lack tools to
 
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
capture Municipal revenue from this
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
visitation to defay the costs that they
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
issue so this bill proposes one tool and
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
my my ask to everyone here with complete
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
humility is if you hate this
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
solution tell us what other solution
 
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
might work for you because the people in
 
01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.470 align:start position:0%
might work for you because the people in
my

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
town are frustrated they're frustrated
 
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
that they are bearing the costs of this
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
tourism which we all benefit from across
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
the state right all this money is you
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
know from rooms and meals is flowing
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
into our state budget it's helping us
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
pay for the things we all need it's
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
being dispersed out to other
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities so the folks in my town
 
01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:01.639 align:start position:0%
are clamoring for for better tools that
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
will help us toay these costs that we
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
are bearing for
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
everyone I think we're flexible on the
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
solutions but in action for my
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
constituents is a
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
do the goal of this bill in essence is
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
to create a user fee for the municipal
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
services that our visitors often take
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
for granted right that police force that
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
oversized police force that oversized
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
Wastewater infrastructure all these
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
costs that we're bearing from
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
accommodating all of those visitors it
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
is a local option this is strictly local
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
option it would require approval of the
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body and all the revenues
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
collected would be held in a fund and
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
limited to the purposes contemplated by
 
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
this bill it's not a free frall it's not
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
just the money comes in and you can
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
spend it however you want it is intended
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
to be spent on defraying the costs that
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
this visitation
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
creates what this bill would do it was
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
it would allow the
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
municipality to create an occupancy fee
 
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
of up to $2 per
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
night that the municipality would then
 
01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
hold and that those funds could be used
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
to defay those costs we also recognize
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
that there are some Associated costs to
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
the operators in this bill we have said
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
that just like with the meals and rooms
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
tax they are allowed to retain 3% of the
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
money they collect to help them to defay
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
costs um so with that I will turn it
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
support questions representative
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
Gerard thank you madam CH thank you
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my questions
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess I I have a couple questions
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully I can do a followup in a
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
moment how do the overnight stays burden
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
the community I guess is my first
 
01:25:09.629 --> 01:25:09.639 align:start position:0%
question how do overnight stays burden
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
the community is that the
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
question the transient traffic in the
 
01:25:19.229 --> 01:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
community is the burden right so we have
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
you know if we have a town of 10,000
 
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
people and suddenly we have 40,000
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
people in the town we have all the
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
challenges of a town of 40,000 right so
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
while our local population has not grown
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
and our tax base has not grown we have
 
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
to have the police force that is able to
 
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
deal with that larger population and the
 
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
disruptions caused by that that larger
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
population similarly Wastewater is
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
another example our roads are another
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
example that we are dealing with a
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount um a visitation and
 
01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
that that brings costs to the
 
01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.830 align:start position:0%
that that brings costs to the
municipality

01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.910 align:start position:0%
municipality
followup

01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
yes based upon your comments I'm looking
 
01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
at lines 14 through 16 where you talk
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
about this money wouldn't go to the
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
general fund if we're actually trying to
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
offset the costs of services why
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
fund says such funds shall be used to
 
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
augment funding of the cost of Municipal
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
service associated with increase in
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
tourism trans any funds received shall
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
not be deemed part of the general fund
 
01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.189 align:start position:0%
not be deemed part of the general fund
Community

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
Community
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
Surplus um I think I follow your
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
question I think our goal here was to to
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
en our goal in this language was to
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
ensure and I think this was meant to
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
some degree as a reassurance to folks
 
01:26:50.189 --> 01:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
that this money wouldn't just go toward
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
anything under the sun right that we
 
01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:53.719 align:start position:0%
would try to ensure that these were
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
tailored to specific areas of the
 
01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
municip municipal budget that were
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
impacted by that transient
 
01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
you further questions the chair
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'll keep it
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
1724 um two
 
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that's it uh adding the uh
 
01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.350 align:start position:0%
and I think that's it uh adding the uh
Town

01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
Town
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
Council absolutely y okay thank
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
frock thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative for your presentation
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
I've been caught up in Conway traffic uh
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
numerous times I I appreciate your
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
dilemma uh I have two questions Maybe
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
one um firstly do you have an estimate
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
of how much revenue would be realized
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
through a local option rooms tax not to
 
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:10.669 align:start position:0%
through a local option rooms tax not to
exceed

01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
exceed
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
$2 and does
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
that is that a $2 per room or per person
 
01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:22.470 align:start position:0%
that is that a $2 per room or per person
per

01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
night thank you uh that is a great uh
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
question I don't have a current estimate
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
on that I know that our town manager was
 
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
hoping to be here uh and he would
 
01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
probably be better able to comment on
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
that he did not make it I would be happy
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
to have him follow up with you on the
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
question regarding um the um
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
estimate I would say at this point it is
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
strict it would strictly be an estimate
 
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
right we I think we probably won't have
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
a a a great figure until it's actually
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
been collected right um and in terms of
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
occupancy um my that's a good question
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
my assumption and my intention would was
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
that it would be per room but I will
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
double check on that and make sure that
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
case uh
 
01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
followup yes uh would this tax also
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
occupancies it does include room
 
01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
occupancies it does include room
facilitators

01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
correct further
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative majority thank
 
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chairwoman and thank you so
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
much for for taking my question I I have
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
long been in support of this kind of
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
idea being on the Sea Coast and and
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing similar things and I can't
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
believe I'm asking this question I must
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
have asked it before we must have
 
01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
addressed it but have you contacted Dr
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
about the accounting for this is this a
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
do to do from kind of situation or you
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
know how does the money get transferred
 
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
and when or is that just part of what
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
the community would
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
establish the intent of the bill is for
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
municipality representative Gilman is
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
um uh in your town are the water and
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
sewer Services uh Enterprise funds being
 
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
taxes that's a great question I'll have
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
to get back to you okay thank
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
you representative grund is
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
recognized great thank you madam chair
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
following up
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
on for earlier question when towns
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
cities do their budgets they budget for
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue as well
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
so you would probably do an estimate
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
budget of the $2 you'd probably have an
 
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
idea the first year would be hard I'm
 
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
sure but you'd have you just put it into
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
a revenue line I don't know do you think
 
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
there's really a need to offset into a
 
01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:11.719 align:start position:0%
special Revenue fund because it's going
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
to be dispersed of different utilities
 
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
different safety groups this and that
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't it just be part of
 
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue so I think you're getting at the
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
same question that representative Gerard
 
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
asked um I
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
will I I don't object to the direction
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
in which you're headed with that
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
question however I will say that I have
 
01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
received push back from those who have
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
concern that not handling it in this
 
01:31:44.189 --> 01:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
manner would mean that the that the
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
funds could be used for unrel purposes
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
unrelated to those intended by the bill
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
so it was framed in this way to try to
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
address those concerns I I understand
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
what you're saying um but I think we
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
framed it this way to try to assuage
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
raised yes all right so a quick followup
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
so when we budget our expenses you're
 
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
budgeting for that 40,000 people not the
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
10,000 people so the revenue is there to
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
offset the expenses so I just go back to
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be dispersed to so many
 
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
different groups this seems like a
 
01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
complicated way to back the revenue
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
heard and
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
understood further questions the chair
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative lward thank
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
01:32:35.109 --> 01:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
question um I started doing research in
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
one town regarding short-term rentals
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
and whether or not they were registered
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
with Dr offer rooms and meals tax and
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
three out of
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
seven were
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
um research for enforcement purposes the
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
registrations so you're raising a really
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
important question um and one that I
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
think is deserving of the legislator's
 
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.550 align:start position:0%
think is deserving of the legislator's
intention

01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
intention
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
attention the answer to your question
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
about Conway is yes um we have Town
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
staff who have in a very ineff manner
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
frankly um you know on the local
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers dime done that work of going
 
01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
onto these various platforms and
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
scraping that data and you know
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
determining how many of these rentals
 
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
are on the market those short-term
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
rentals I will say that that is a
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
very in my mind that is a very
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
inefficient way to do that work there
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
should be a way that a much more
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
efficient way to handle that and perhaps
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
at the state level but to answer your
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
question directly Conway is deciding to
 
01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.109 align:start position:0%
question directly Conway is deciding to
do

01:33:59.109 --> 01:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
that representative frock is recognized
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam
 
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
chair um another question have you done
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
any comparative analysis
 
01:34:19.709 --> 01:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
between instituting a flat up to $2 per
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
room uh fee or tax versus any other sort
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
of local tax such as a
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
local uh say another percent on the
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax or perhaps
 
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
instituting I know this is New Hampshire
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
and it's not right but perhaps a one or
 
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.709 --> 01:34:49.719 align:start position:0%
tax well I'll Echo your comment about
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
the last part about a sales tax I don't
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
think that's on the table ever
 
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.070 align:start position:0%
think that's on the table ever
um

01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
inter go for it you go for it um I'm
 
01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
going to stay over here on that one um
 
01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of meals and rooms I think that
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
is an that is an alternate path um I
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
will I will
 
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
say as my son would say the math the
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
math isn't mathing you know when I think
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
about trying to put put forward some
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
sort of rejiggering of our meals and
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
rooms formula to deliver more for
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
example not proposing this but for
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
example to deliver more of the revenue
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
to the towns that are contributing the
 
01:35:32.109 --> 01:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
most what that suddenly starts is a war
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
between people in different
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities right where okay my town
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
may get more but that means your town
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
gets less and then when I think about
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
trying to move that through the
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislature whether or not I think it's
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
fairer I can't get you know Manchester's
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
not going to get on board Nash was going
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
to get on not going to get on board and
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
we I just don't see that as a realistic
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
path politically that we'll get it done
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
personally um if this committee you know
 
01:36:01.149 --> 01:36:01.159 align:start position:0%
back to my initial plea of if this
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
option doesn't work for you all help me
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
find an option that does um you know if
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
that's if this committee is on board
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
with that path let's talk but I think
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
this to me represents the most realistic
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
solution to the problem that towns like
 
01:36:19.239 --> 01:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
solution to the problem that towns like
mine

01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
mine
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
face further questions represent of
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
Colby is
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you R Madam chair thank
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I would be
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you on this um my
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
question was there there is um there's
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
an exception for municipalities for
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax um I think about
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
people who receive local assistance uh
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
from municipalities to stay in a hotel
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
right um would uh municipalities be
 
01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:55.159 align:start position:0%
exempt and from from paying this $2
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
robbing Peter to PayPal yes that's the
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
intent there is a 30-day like typic
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
typically you're looking at like
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
emergency housing assistance is the kind
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
of thing I'm I'm assuming you're talking
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
about yeah um so there is a uh it only
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
it it would not apply for folks who are
 
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
for 30 days or longer in a motel for
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
example and we have a lot of that I
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't in in Carrol County we have we're
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
the only County that has no homeless
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
shelter and no transitional housing um
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
so that is how we handle that and we
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
tried to craft this to accommodate that
 
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
we I'm also open to additional language
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
there to reinforce that thank you
 
01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.510 align:start position:0%
there to reinforce that thank you
additional

01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
questions seeing seeing none thank you
 
01:37:37.679 --> 01:37:39.470 align:start position:0%
questions seeing seeing none thank you
thank

01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
you next the chair recognizes
 
01:37:42.159 --> 01:37:48.270 align:start position:0%
you next the chair recognizes
representative

01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you madam chair um I can
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
assure you when we start it will not be
 
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
as eloquent as the pray speaker um I
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
will give you a little uh answer another
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
question you brought up before the short
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
ter rental in the hotels and and try to
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
get a picture for
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
you when David was talking about the
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
consistent upper when people say to me
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
when the first thing I see coming out of
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
the car next door is two 30 packs of Bud
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
Light I know it's going to be a tough
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
weekend for me because they are sdrs
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
that are in in multiple areas formerly
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
residential areas in
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
town uh and if you driven through the
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
strip with remaining of the strip in
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
North Conway if you could get through
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
one of BU today uh there are multiple
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
hotels and and and those can Le on as um
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
concerning some of the Str strs that you
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
were talking about but the question
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
becomes where ises this money going why
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's because we have the additional
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
shortterm folks there hotels a little
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
more policing significantly by their
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
security staffs than other people in
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
town that creates more calls for our
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
police more calls for our fire more
 
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
calls for our EMS service these services
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
that are paid out of local taxes local
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
representatives and get no reimbursement
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
for there's nothing coming back to the
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
town for the extra calls so when Dave
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
was talking about going a double police
 
01:39:17.229 --> 01:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
force to size 20,000 or 10,000 people
 
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
and now 30 or 40 that's where the some
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
of their cost comes from and that's why
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
the separate count was to go back for
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
police Fire EMS and Wastewater we are a
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
small town last year we sat here at
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
David N and the mayors of uh Manchester
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
conquer Portsmouth Hamin they were all
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
here because this is enabling
 
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
legislation this is not for the state
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
this is if they particular town or city
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
wants it a few folks allow it and the
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
house downstairs allows it and it goes
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
through the process um because it gives
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
them another tool as as they indicated
 
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
so that's one of that's the big concern
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
with this particular piece of legis
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
ation is it is a tool for those
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
particular locals that have it's not for
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
every city in town there's a lot of
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
cities in towns in New Hampshire uh that
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a hotel who don't have these
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
problems and don't have the extra cost
 
01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:04.830 align:start position:0%
problems and don't have the extra cost
of

01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
services so we have a hard time keeping
 
01:40:10.589 --> 01:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
up with that uh cost in our town because
 
01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
it goes back to the 10,000 people you're
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
all talking about taxes New Hampshire
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
residential tax and the after your
 
01:40:17.589 --> 01:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
assessment the bill comes in I'm sure
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
your town are different than ours
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
they're all screaming the taxes are up
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
but they are up but these are
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
artificially uh increased because of the
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
costs that aren't related to what locals
 
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
get out of it and that's the whole
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of this of this piece um and i'
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
go back to the fact that it is enabling
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
and that we're just trying to uh help
 
01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
those three services please fire us last
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
year we had five fire departments in
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
town three volunteer two with two
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
employees two with one this year we have
 
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:49.719 align:start position:0%
two remaining volunteers unlike David
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
they're like me they're getting too old
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
and there's nobody left in the fire
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
departments so that this just the cost
 
01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
of increased fire department inre
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
increased Staffing uh in the two we have
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
ref the EMS serve the same
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
way and I guess I guess I would close
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
with a picture and the picture is my
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
hotel bill when I go someplace typically
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
people travel for a couple reasons
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for death or illness and
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
all the rest the discretionary money and
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
when you get your hotel buillt and I'm
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
sure I'm at the lower end because I stay
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
at the lower the hotel bill uh versus
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
the con has hotels that go from $200 to
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
$500 a night right I'm sure some of the
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
towns you
 
01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
have and you get the your $250 Bill and
 
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:37.719 align:start position:0%
you get this tax that tax and you look
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
down the bottom I'm taking it now Tak it
 
01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
to Disneyland right you get a hotel bill
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
that says $200 a night in a local tax
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
state tax county tax safy assessment $2
 
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
D you aren't thinking about those $2
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
you're paying $ 250 $500 your hotel bill
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
the last thing you're thinking about is
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
a $2 safety assessment it's nothing to
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
you it's not going to impact tourism by
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
any means it's not going to impact our
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
bnbs it's not going to impact anything
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
so this this enabling legislation is
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
actually putting an additional safety
 
01:42:13.589 --> 01:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
fee for safety for the people coming to
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
our town that's causing additional costs
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
for our town and I would be happy to
 
01:42:21.629 --> 01:42:21.639 align:start position:0%
take any U questions that you may have
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure I get stuck call
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
David thank you representative Woodcock
 
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative seeing
 
01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
none oh I'm sorry represent Vice
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald's is recognized thank
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
you nice to see you representative
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
Woodcock why can't you as a town just
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
charge the hotel that fee and they don't
 
01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
pass it on to the
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
consumer you mean the nightly occupant
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
fee yeah I just don't want I don't I
 
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
don't like to just I don't want to like
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
a bill where it says uh $200 here in
 
01:42:59.950 --> 01:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
rooms in tax $50 and then this whatever
 
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
you want to call this particular fee why
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
can't you as a community automatically
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
just charge the hotel for uh say 100
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
nights at whatever fee you want to
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
charge him at $200 without passing it on
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:43:15.709 --> 01:43:15.719 align:start position:0%
consumer repr MCD that's a an
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
interesting question we hadn't thought
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
of that um candly because you roll it
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
into the hotels which are easier
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
obviously to dialogue with in terms of
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
of reconciliation but the the shter
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
rentals uh in our town are also an
 
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
additional I would say more problemsome
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
than the hotels so it's just trying to
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
get back because it's not going to
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
impact uh the the business and the
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
operator of the hotel uh so I think it
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
becomes more discriminatory when you do
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
that when you say you're just going to
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
charge the hotels or on on every night
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
um it's also easy to doing nightly
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
occupancy and as the bill shows anything
 
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
over 30 it's not going to hit any body
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
any Apartments if you rent the apartment
 
01:43:55.950 --> 01:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
for a month it's not going to impact
 
01:43:57.589 --> 01:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
that it's just it's just the people who
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
are there and transient tourists using
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
those costs so we hadn't looked at that
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
be honest represent do because we
 
01:44:05.229 --> 01:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
thought it at least time two years ago
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
was more um discriminatory trying to
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
identify a particular entity and then
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
charge it for cost that may not
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
be thank you but thank you further
 
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative majori thank
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair W and thank you
 
01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
representative taking my quick question
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
fulltime and
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer uh firefighters do you have
 
01:44:30.589 --> 01:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
firefighters paramedics the whole
 
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
range volunteer and
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
full-time we have three I think three
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
and two we have maybe the maximum of
 
01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
seven I'm going to say between the two
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
new stations because they just came
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
together maybe seven full-time um and
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer every time you ring the bell
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
who can get out of work so I have no
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
idea if they're down here if it down
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
here when it goes off we just have a
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
nice Foundation left when you get there
 
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
yeah additional
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
you very much M
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
Dees thank you madam chairwoman and
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee uh for the
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
record my name is Brody Dees I represent
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Municipal Hampshire
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and we strongly
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
support house bill um 54 4 I'll be very
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
brief with my testimony this would allow
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
um would allow the legislative bodies
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
and municipalities to adopt a local two
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
up to a local $2 per occupancy fee uh
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
for folks who stay overnight at hotels
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
um this is a very modest fee um by
 
01:45:43.229 --> 01:45:43.239 align:start position:0%
looking for public support you're
 
01:45:44.669 --> 01:45:44.679 align:start position:0%
essentially asking your property
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for a new form of relief
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a long history of making
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
sure that tourists who utilize our
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
communities and our spaces um that
 
01:45:55.589 --> 01:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
they're helping offset the cost to the
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
state municipalities this was done you
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
know for at least 50 years now with the
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax um the goal of this
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill would be for that $2 up to that $2
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
modest fee it could be less than that it
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
could be a percentage but no more than
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
$2 um would offset the disproportionate
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
costs some municipalities bear to drive
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
this rooms of meals tax revenue and to
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
drive our tourism economy um there are
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
some of our larger cities or some of our
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
more tourism towns like wolf bro Conway
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
or others really do a lot to build their
 
01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to make sure that there's
 
01:46:31.149 --> 01:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
the proper
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
um that there's the proper
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure there that exists to
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that hotels and higher density
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
development can be there and um and to
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
take care of their different public
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
spaces beaches and other recreating
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
areas um so that our tourism economy Can
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
Survive and Thrive and some
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities would like to be able to
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
have the right to raise this $2 fee to
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
help offset those costs specifically in
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
this case um to whatever the public body
 
01:46:58.109 --> 01:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
would decide this money would go towards
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's strictly Public Safety
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
upkeep of some of the different
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure costs um whatever kind of
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
Tourism related expenses there may be um
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
this bill supports local property
 
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so then that burden doesn't
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
just fall into them municipalities have
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
only one way of raising revenue um
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's through either different fees the
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
state permits or property taxes and the
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
majority of um the different support
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
that municipalities provide in the
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
different infrastructure they provide to
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
support a tourism industry fall on the
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
backs of property taxpayers so this bill
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
would be a creative solution or some
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
form of it I've heard some interesting
 
01:47:33.070 --> 01:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
and good ideas to help those
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities though figure out a way
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the burden of
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
supporting the tourism industry isn't
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
just on the property taxpayers that some
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
of that burden can be shared by those
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
who are visiting recreating and
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
utilizing the services who aren't
 
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
full-time residents of the state but
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
visitors and who are probably quite
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
happy considering they're racking up
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
bills on other things to pay that
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
additional $2 a night to help
 
01:47:55.390 --> 01:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
keep our uh our tourism industry
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable and our our funding stream
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
sustainable too for the property
 
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and with that I'll take any
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%

01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
544
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
and I must start off by saying here we
 
01:48:57.790 --> 01:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
go again I need someone to explain to me
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
why they feel the need to single out
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
lodging just lodging for this ridiculous
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
tax and that's what it is a tax which
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
down the road is going to encourage more
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
worthless legislation for unne for more
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary taxes this so-called fee is
 
01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.229 align:start position:0%
unnecessary taxes this so-called fee is
very

01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and I love that word
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
discriminatory in today's world it
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
states in your proposed bill that the
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
fund shall be used used to augment
 
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
funding for the cost of Municipal
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
Services associated with the increase in
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
tourism and transient taxes do people
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
just magically show up at my bed and
 
01:49:35.229 --> 01:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
breakfast and not go anywhere or do
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
anything why not add this fee to
 
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
restaurant bills at the gas pumps at the
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
tolls at the grocery store and
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
entertainment facilities tourism is a
 
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
major part of the New Hampshire economy
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
why is lodging being singled out and
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
called a burden to Municipal budgets
 
01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
I'll answer that for you lodging
 
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
facilities are not a particular burden
 
01:49:59.229 --> 01:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
they're just an easy target to tax my
 
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:00.679 align:start position:0%
business sits in the beautiful new
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
Newfound Lake Region and we rely heavily
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
on tourists legitimate lodging establ
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
establishments already collect 8 and a
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
half% M&amp;R and the M&amp;R has already lost
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
its credibility what was once used to
 
01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
promote tourism in the state now goes
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
into the general fund line in my town to
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
be used for whatever and I'm just going
 
01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
to digress a second here I was sitting
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
back there
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
and uh even in the previous two bills
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
that we heard people were complaining of
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
their their increase in taxes personally
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
my taxes just went up over $3,000 this
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
year over
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
$3,000 in
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
taxes and I looked at Conway's M&amp;R what
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're getting for their taxes and from
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R they're getting over $900,000 this
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
year that can that's going to pay a lot
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
of cops for some public safety out there
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure this happens with other
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
other cities and towns when they receive
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
their fair share of the M&amp;R and now
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat more adding another fee to my
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
guest is going to deter them from stain
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
and reduce my business when I travel
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
nothing frustrates me more than seeing
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
my bill from a lodging facility that
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
includes a city tax occupancy tax a
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
state tax and an airport tax if I happen
 
01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
to stay near one as legitimate lodging
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
businesses we're already undermined by
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
Airbnb VRBO and other online booking
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
companies as well as real estate rental
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
companies who do and can work outside
 
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
the state Rags are towns going to be
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
required are able to collect the $2 per
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
room per night from these online
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
companies and if you look at the RSA
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
which I did this morning at 7:30 uh
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
airbnbs vrbos are not covered in the RSA
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
and according to the stats they rent a
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
lot of rooms they're not just Mrs Smith
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
renting an extra room in her house
 
01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
they're major International companies
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
Bristol has one one legitimate lodging
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
me and no other legitimate lodging
 
01:52:04.069 --> 01:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
operations and I am as our my fellow B&amp;B
 
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
and inke Keepers very transparent in our
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
operations because companies like Airbnb
 
01:52:12.030 --> 01:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to compete on a Level Playing
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
Field we're losing local business I
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
can't see how my seven room bed and
 
01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
breakfast is going to make enough to
 
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
fund our Town's ability to aument
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
funding for the cost of Municipal
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
Services associated with the increase in
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
tourism and transient traffic and again
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to digress when he said when I
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
can't see his name it's it's got a glare
 
01:52:36.510 --> 01:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
on it they're going to charge just bill
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
us an estimated amount of money Bill me
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
directly for how many rooms I have
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
seriously I see that these revenues
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
collected shall be deposited in a
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
capital reserve fund tourism support
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
fund revolving fund or other special
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue fund and as may be authorized
 
01:52:57.069 --> 01:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
and the requirement for the use of these
 
01:52:59.229 --> 01:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
funds is so loose that ways will be
 
01:53:01.709 --> 01:53:01.719 align:start position:0%
devised to use them anyway so you want
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
to tax one business one business for the
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
benefit of a Town's bottom line and how
 
01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
is this tax going to be enforced does it
 
01:53:13.149 --> 01:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
give the state or even my town the right
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
to audit me to make sure I'm giving my
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
town the $2 a room Big Brother's truly
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
watching me and one about administrative
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
and enforcement costs to the town how
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
will they be paid I also see that the
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
Bill's requirement to go into effect
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
towns need to vote on it I shudder at
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
that a thought I know how my people in
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
my town think and they're going to view
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
this as a property tax reduction and
 
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to get voted in without
 
01:53:40.589 --> 01:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
regard to its long-term consequences or
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
thought of the overall cost to implement
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
and administer the collected fee the
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
amount that small towns could collect is
 
01:53:49.629 --> 01:53:49.639 align:start position:0%
inconsequential this bill is obviously
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
being proposed by largest cities as a
 
01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
money grab for them
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
why do you think it's okay to burden one
 
01:53:57.149 --> 01:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
business segment to SCT monies for a
 
01:53:58.830 --> 01:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
town that's not able to properly balance
 
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
their budget the bottom line is it's
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
going to put an additional burden on me
 
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
the town and my fellow legitimate
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
lodging Partners to collect and remit
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
yet another tax the proposed legislation
 
01:54:15.069 --> 01:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
is very careful to call it a fee however
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's just political speak let's call
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
it what it truly is another tax I urge
 
01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
you to truly think about what you're
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
requesting please don't turn New
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%

had so I will ask is there anybody
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
present who wishes to speak to this bill
 
01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
who we
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%

chair members of the committee for the
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mike Summers I'm the
 
01:54:59.950 --> 01:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
president CEO of the New Hampshire
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
lodging and Restaurant Association I
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to testify but I wanted to
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
make a couple of additional points um
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
obviously here in opposition to uh House
 
01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:08.589 align:start position:0%
obviously here in opposition to uh House
Bill

01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
544 um couple things that I want to
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
raise that I don't think were mentioned
 
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
that I think are worth noting um as um
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
Heidi just mentioned this bill does not
 
01:55:20.069 --> 01:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
cover short-term rentals not in the
 
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
definition of hotels not in the
 
01:55:23.069 --> 01:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
definition of occup occupant nowhere in
 
01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
any of that does this capture the
 
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals so ultimately having
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
heard from the municipal uh
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities that testified uh
 
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals create the problems
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
and then the hotels are expected to pay
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
for them and I think that's unfair and I
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
think that's a huge problem for the
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
state and granted there's a problem we
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
need to figure it out but that's not
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily A a fair and Equitable
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
solution one other thing that I want to
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
raise for you is that the FTC recently
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
passed a junk fee Rule and I'm not sure
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
if you heard about this hotels are
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
included in this the junk fee rule
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
basically prohibits us from having
 
01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
anything outside of outside of taxes uh
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
Government taxes would have to be
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
included in the total price of the the
 
01:56:07.229 --> 01:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
the of the um occupancy so then now
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
we're in a situation where it is unclear
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
to us if this fee would then be forced
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
to be just become part of the price and
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
therefore ultimately the business owner
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
is going to be paying this so you know
 
01:56:18.589 --> 01:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
at that point um it's a bit of tomato
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
tomato but it essentially just becomes
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
another bill that the business is going
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
to have to pay
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
um I also did not hear anybody really
 
01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
mention the importance of the commercial
 
01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
tax base yes I understand res
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
residential taxes are going up my
 
01:56:35.069 --> 01:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
personal taxes went up dramatically as
 
01:56:37.149 --> 01:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
well but I also think that
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities forget that these
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
commercial businesses in all of their uh
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions are paying an enormous
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
amount of uh commercial property taxes
 
01:56:46.589 --> 01:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
and and much of that goes to the town so
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
we just need to recognize that there is
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of feedback going into the
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
towns from commercial tax base from the
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax Etc so there's an
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
awful lot of money that is being
 
01:56:59.310 --> 01:56:59.320 align:start position:0%
generated by these businesses from
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
tourism that are going back to the
 
01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:02.750 align:start position:0%
tourism that are going back to the
municipalities

01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
already um and then the other thing and
 
01:57:07.229 --> 01:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
this is a question and I don't know the
 
01:57:08.589 --> 01:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
answer but it's a question for all of
 
01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
you to as as you deliberate on this
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation is at a
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
$2 fee the question I have is is that
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
even going to raise enough money for the
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
municipality to actually cover the cost
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
of Enforcement Administration of this
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
cuz now you're essentially going to have
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
to have tax or fee collection whatever
 
01:57:26.910 --> 01:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
you want to call it of by the the
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
business remitted to the town the town's
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to keep track of that
 
01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:31.639 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be some sort of
 
01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
a verification process that I would
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
assume this then triggers a new audit
 
01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
process for the business owner which is
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
another thing that we would have to deal
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
with so in all of that process my
 
01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
suspicion is $2 isn't going to cover the
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
cost for the municipality to even
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
administer this program which means it
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
we'll be back here next year the year
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
after looking at a $5 per night fee
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
which is obviously one thing that our
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
industry does not want to see so with
 
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
that I will close I'm happy to try to
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and I will submit a
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%

sir for your testimony um I just lost my
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
RSA line um seven six and seven defining
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
a room
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
facilitator isn't that not applicable to
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
an Airbnb or short-term rental
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
um I again I was just looking at the the
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
definitions that were included at the
 
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
start of the bill where it talks about a
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
hotel and it talks about an occupancy
 
01:58:42.069 --> 01:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
and in in those references which is what
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 78 A3 something in those references
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
it just specifically outlines as hotels
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
followup Madam
 
01:58:55.629 --> 01:58:55.639 align:start position:0%
chair yes yes thank you um if you do
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
78- a colon 3 Roman
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
facilitator it is any person who makes a
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
room available
 
01:59:16.599 --> 01:59:18.550 align:start position:0%
room available
for

01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
occupancy so under you I'm sorry I don't
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
have the bill in front of me so I'm
 
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
speaking from the hip a little bit here
 
01:59:27.149 --> 01:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
but um I looked specifically at the
 
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
definitions the two definitions listed
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
at the start of the bill which speaks to
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
hotel and it speaks to occupant and
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
under occupant in the statute which I
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
believe is uh 12 XI means any person who
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
for rent paid uses possesses or has a
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
right to use or possess any room in a
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
hotel under any leas concession permit
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
right of access so in in that I in my
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
reading it's just for um but but again
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
you're the the policy committee on this
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just raising our concerns and and
 
02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
issues thank you thank you further
 
02:00:03.149 --> 02:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman is
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
question um I understand the um the view
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
of this being a an attack on a
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
particular line of business um but my
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
question to you is wood lodgings and
 
02:00:21.629 --> 02:00:21.639 align:start position:0%
other other services um or similar
 
02:00:21.639 --> 02:00:22.950 align:start position:0%
other other services um or similar
services

02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh be able to support what you do if you
 
02:00:29.310 --> 02:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the infrastructure of the
 
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
fire and police and water and sewer fair
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
question um but we are also of the
 
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
opinion that the rooms of meals tax that
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities receive now is for that
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
very purpose is to support that
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for tourism and I would
 
02:00:43.629 --> 02:00:43.639 align:start position:0%
also say that people don't come to New
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to stay in a hotel people come
 
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire to hike bike snowmobile
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
ski whatever it might be there is no
 
02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
fees charged any of them on any of that
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
activity it's just the lodging
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
properties well and restaurants as
 
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you further

questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:10.040 align:start position:0%

support and four opposed and you might
 
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at them because two
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%

schedule so um just would like to note
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
that so we
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
we may need to keep um track of time
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
maybe not we'll see how it goes but at
 
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:00.440 align:start position:0%

02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%

County and the current redistricting
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
plan um I'm going to point out what I
 
02:03:59.229 --> 02:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
think are some deficiencies in it but I
 
02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
will say every town is included and
 
02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
every ward in the three cities they're
 
02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
all included and actually it also does
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
meet the basic statistical requirements
 
02:04:11.950 --> 02:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
for district so it's uh it could have
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
been worse but so up until the most
 
02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
recent election cycle straford County
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
elected his three County Commissioners
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
at large it was the only County did this
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
has been doing this um I've heard since
 
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
1865 anyway a very very long time and um
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
so I may be prejudiced but I think
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's how all the smaller counties
 
02:04:34.109 --> 02:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
should choose their Commissioners um
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the remarks I made about
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
how it is easy to divide grafting County
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
into into three districts but I think
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
probably even Grafton County um you know
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
there there's a case being made for even
 
02:04:46.109 --> 02:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
having that County as an at large
 
02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
District now straford county is unique
 
02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
because there really is no good way to
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
divide the county up into three people
 
02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
pieces I mean maybe it's better than
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about a few minutes
 
02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
ago but um it's two largest cities are
 
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
Rochester and Dover they have almost
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
exactly the same number of residents
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
they're reach about 25% of the total
 
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
population Trafford County
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
geographically it's the smallest county
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the state its population is uh is
 
02:05:13.629 --> 02:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
about a in fact I think it's exactly
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
average we're exactly very close to
 
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
exactly 10% of the county of the total
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
population of the state and the red
 
02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
rcking plan hly pass in 2023 as I said
 
02:05:26.109 --> 02:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
it could have been much worse but it did
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
meet some basic statistical standards
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
it's really not a good plan at all um
 
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
this proposed District 2 the one where I
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
live and commissioner M Lis lives I it's
 
02:05:37.709 --> 02:05:37.719 align:start position:0%
not even contiguous except in the very
 
02:05:39.790 --> 02:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
loosest sense of the term contiguous
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
although I will say in all fairness we
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
have drawn other districts that relied
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the same thing so it's um if you if
 
02:05:49.229 --> 02:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
if you look at the map it uh it's
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
contiguous because there's one point
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
where I forget exactly which Ward it is
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
in Dover and Durham meet out in the
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
middle of the the Bellamy River
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
underwater so it's not really a
 
02:06:02.549 --> 02:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
contiguous District but Stanford County
 
02:06:04.589 --> 02:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
uh consists of three cities and 10 Towns
 
02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
all of which are actually included in
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
the the current County redistricting
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner plans at least every
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
every town and every Ward and every city
 
02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
does at least have a county
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner um one of those 10 Towns
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
Durham where I live is for almost all
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
practical purposes City the only really
 
02:06:22.750 --> 02:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
significant differences in terms of How
 
02:06:24.430 --> 02:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
It's governed between Durham and the
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
three cities is that it calls itself a
 
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
town it lacks a mayor it just has a Town
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
Council and a city manager and it has no
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
Wards and the third difference is
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
probably crucial for the current
 
02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
discussion we're having because the lack
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
of wards meant there was no way to carve
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
Durham up between multiple electric
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
electoral districts and um I was
 
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
actually living in Grafton County when
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
they made the change over but I I seem
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
to recall that that may have been one of
 
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
the reasons why
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
they decided to have just a town with no
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
Wards so like it wouldn't get they
 
02:06:59.069 --> 02:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to worry about it being uh
 
02:07:01.229 --> 02:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
subdivided between multiple they weren't
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
probably weren't thinking about County
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioner districts but certainly
 
02:07:05.229 --> 02:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
between multiple State Rep districts so
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
we do like
 
02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
um we we do like having it having like
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
at least four reps including myself all
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
to ourselves and not splitting them up
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
with some other city so we um Durham is
 
02:07:18.910 --> 02:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
actually significantly larger than the
 
02:07:20.669 --> 02:07:20.679 align:start position:0%
third the smallest city which the
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
Summers where so we have uh oh it's 12%
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
of population Sumer worth only has 9% of
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
population they do have five Wards to
 
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
work with and the three cities in Durham
 
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
collectively comprise 71% of the
 
02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:33.990 align:start position:0%
collectively comprise 71% of the
County's

02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
County's
 
02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:37.159 align:start position:0%
population um so there was some talk
 
02:07:39.229 --> 02:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
about that the towns needed more
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
representation on the uh in the in the
 
02:07:44.470 --> 02:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh when they passed the three District
 
02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
plan although it didn't the plan they
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
passed didn't really do that but it's
 
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
highly unusual to pass a redistricting
 
02:07:52.109 --> 02:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
plan in the middle of a 10 year census
 
02:07:54.069 --> 02:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
cycle and of course it's probably highly
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
red unusual to resend the redistricting
 
02:07:59.229 --> 02:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
plan and have an single at large
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
District the middle of 10e census cycle
 
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
but we're going back to what was uh
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
taken up during the normal process for
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
redistricting so redistricting bills
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
normally they're only taken up
 
02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
immediately after desial census such as
 
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:16.079 align:start position:0%
the 2020 census which we had 5 years ago
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
or the 2030 census which is coming up
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
pretty soon at least hopefully coming up
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
pretty soon everything is kind of
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
Uncertain Nationwide but um the issue of
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
changing the large election of the
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
Strafford County Commissioners never
 
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
came at all up at all during the
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
redistricting debate which was uh in 20
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
I say here in the last few months of
 
02:08:36.030 --> 02:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
2021 and the first half of 2022 and I
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
was not on the redistricting committee
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
but I followed all the meetings closely
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
and I remember the one where they dealt
 
02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
with the County Commissioners they just
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
sort of approved the at large District
 
02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
in about three minutes you know it was
 
02:08:48.510 --> 02:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
not this was not a major uh this was not
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
a major controversy and certainly before
 
02:08:51.549 --> 02:08:51.559 align:start position:0%
that when they had the various hearing
 
02:08:52.990 --> 02:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
ings and the rest of the
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
process um nobody asked for it you know
 
02:08:57.310 --> 02:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
nobody uh you know this was not
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
something that anybody said Gee we
 
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
really should divide Stanford County the
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
three commission County Commissioners
 
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
districts the people are happy with the
 
02:09:07.229 --> 02:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
at large District um and so that was
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
just something basically no one ever
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
asked for except for a few a few members
 
02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
of the county delegation not even
 
02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
anything close to majority the county
 
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
delegation and uh so this is just
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
something certain nobody in the public
 
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
asked for this and in fact uh in the
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
convoluted boundary the three new
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
districts don't make any no sense at
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
first glance but they do I said they do
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh bring the population deviation of the
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
redistricting plan within the standard
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
like there's a 5% population deviation
 
02:09:41.149 --> 02:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
so it does meet the basic uh it and it
 
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
does meet the basic statistical
 
02:09:45.709 --> 02:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
standards and um of course if that's
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
what you're worried about if that's the
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
if that's the U justification for
 
02:09:50.830 --> 02:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
drawing the county commissioner
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
districts way they are um if you have a
 
02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
single at large district and this you
 
02:09:56.910 --> 02:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
know it's just a three member
 
02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
multi-member district
 
02:10:01.549 --> 02:10:01.559 align:start position:0%
that that reduces a population deviation
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
even further to zero so if what you want
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
is reduce the population deviation of
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
what we had the at large district is the
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
is the uh is the way to go so and um
 
02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan
 
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
um you're at the five minute limit would
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
you be able to to it up I just had well
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
two more things I've one okay I um I am
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
the so please return to Stafford
 
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
County's tradition a good tradition of
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
electing three County Commissioners from
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
a single at large District but also I
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
have to mention I passed around a second
 
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
sheet of paper along with my written
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
testimony which is a Amendment to the
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 6559 which we had a floor debate
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
which uh probably most of the members
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
which I I I subjected the uh members of
 
02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
the Full House to it most probably had
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
no idea what the heck we were talking
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
about but I I respect y this is a
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
related issue to this is this would be a
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
Germaine amendment to my bill and I uh I
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
think I think what I came up with is a
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
very simple solution which makes the
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
minimum number of changes uh to the
 
02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
existing law so basically just keeps the
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
standard of having a domicile in the
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
county but then adds the uh then adds
 
02:11:13.709 --> 02:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
the requirement that if you're a county
 
02:11:15.629 --> 02:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner it simply says You must
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
have a domicile in the district from
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
which uh you of course I changed he to
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
he or she is chosen so the uh what we
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
passed the other day is is well one
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
problem was it talks about for what
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
you're elected but County Commissioners
 
02:11:30.270 --> 02:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
can be chosen because if there's a
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
vacancy in any County Office including
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners actually the county
 
02:11:36.270 --> 02:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
delegation chooses the we don't have a
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
special election they the county
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
delegation choses it and I know this
 
02:11:40.750 --> 02:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
from firsthand experience because we
 
02:11:41.709 --> 02:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
actually had a member of the county
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner di several years ago and we
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
we the county delegation elected the
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
replacement County Commissioner so
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's I think that I
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
respectfully think that's probably a
 
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
better solution than what was uh what
 
02:11:55.390 --> 02:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
was approved by the house and we're
 
02:11:57.870 --> 02:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
certainly um certainly I certainly would
 
02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
urge you to seriously consider
 
02:12:01.069 --> 02:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
regardless of what you feel about the
 
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill sending that to the Full
 
02:12:04.669 --> 02:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
House and I think that's a better
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
solution than what we have it's also
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
something that's probably more likely to
 
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
pass muster on the other side of the
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
wall if and when it gets over to the
 
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
other body so thank you very much your
 
02:12:16.270 --> 02:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
time and thank you representative Morgan
 
02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
I should would have asked for six
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
minutes if I knew I needed more than the
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
see seeing none thank you thank
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
you and the last pink card that we have
 
02:12:31.950 --> 02:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
is commissioner
 
02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
back thank you madam chairman I'm going
 
02:12:47.950 --> 02:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
brief I'm not going to repeat what
 
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan said the the
 
02:12:54.270 --> 02:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners in straford County
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
were elected at large for about 160
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
years during the redistricting process
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
there was not one member of the public
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
who spoke and said that they wanted this
 
02:13:08.589 --> 02:13:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
public later
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
on uh in the last session the
 
02:13:16.830 --> 02:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
legislature decided in it in its wisdom
 
02:13:18.549 --> 02:13:18.559 align:start position:0%
to divide straffic County up into
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
districts when they did so they divided
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
half they determined where I lived tried
 
02:13:29.310 --> 02:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
to figure out how they could Jerry
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
Mander the
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
county and divided Rochester in half
 
02:13:37.549 --> 02:13:37.559 align:start position:0%
divided do in half now I've been through
 
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
five redistricting since I've been in
 
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
public office from straford County five
 
02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:44.549 align:start position:0%
public office from straford County five
of

02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:44.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:13:47.109 --> 02:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
them normally the county delegation as I
 
02:13:48.990 --> 02:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier would meet to discuss
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not they wanted to do this or
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
not whe it was a good idea in those five
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
instances it was determined by the
 
02:13:57.870 --> 02:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
county delegation in those five
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
instances in the last 50 years not to
 
02:14:02.109 --> 02:14:02.119 align:start position:0%
change the way the County Commissioners
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
were elected simply because they had to
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
divide cities in half in order to
 
02:14:11.229 --> 02:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
meet the goal of having equal
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
populations so as I had mentioned in my
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony most of these things
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
are politically motivated it was
 
02:14:20.350 --> 02:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
politically motivated to divide straford
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
County up in a district
 
02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
they disenfranchised 990,000 voters so
 
02:14:26.350 --> 02:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
let's so I'm just want to take one
 
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
minute to tell you what the result of
 
02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.229 align:start position:0%
minute to tell you what the result of
that

02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
was the sponsors of the initial bill
 
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
said that they wanted more repres
 
02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:35.559 align:start position:0%
representation from the towns even
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
though in the last 50 years we've had a
 
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative on the County Commission
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
from a town it's just the way it
 
02:14:45.870 --> 02:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
worked the results of the last
 
02:14:48.109 --> 02:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
election you had ended up with two
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners from
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
do because they split do in
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
half added a few Towns now we got two
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners from do and one
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
from Farmington the prior commission we
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
had myself from Dover a commissioner
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
from Rochester and one from Rollinsford
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
which was a small
 
02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
town if it was the in the sponsor's
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
intent to make sure to ensure that the
 
02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
towns the 10 towns in straford County
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
had equal
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
representation which I think was a bogus
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
argument they should have designed a
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
district with those 10 Towns in
 
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
it they never did that it was
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
politically motivated it was designed to
 
02:15:29.709 --> 02:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
get me and I'm not quite sure it worked
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
thought so as I mentioned my earlier
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
testimony on the past bill you're going
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
to continue to see these bills 95% of
 
02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
these bills that have generated are
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
politically motivated and not and
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
they're not in the interest of the
 
02:15:47.790 --> 02:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
people they disenfranchised 990,000
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
voters in straford County who had the
 
02:15:52.910 --> 02:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
right and the ability to control who
 
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
their executive branch of County
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
government was they took that right away
 
02:15:59.310 --> 02:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
from them that's what they did let's
 
02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
just call the spade a shovel for a
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
minute here that's what they did in an
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
attempt to get
 
02:16:07.709 --> 02:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
me now I've been County Commissioner for
 
02:16:10.109 --> 02:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
21 terms I've been nominated by the
 
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
opposite Party by the Republican Party
 
02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:13.709 align:start position:0%
opposite Party by the Republican Party
13

02:16:13.709 --> 02:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
13
 
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
times and it takes an Act of the
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and it passes by one vote in
 
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
the last session by one member who
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't even legally voting so in any
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
event one final
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
point the cities and towns and the
 
02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
counties are creatures of the state you
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
folks know
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
this they exist solely to provide
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
services on behalf of the
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
state and historically what we've done
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
is we've had the county delegations meet
 
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
and during that census process determine
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
how we were going to govern ourselves
 
02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
these attempts in the off years and also
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court in New Hampshire ruled
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
that the public the public was entitled
 
02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:00.790 align:start position:0%
that the public the public was entitled
to

02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:17:03.150 --> 02:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
stability some
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
stability in this
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
process what they created in straford
 
02:17:09.750 --> 02:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
County the last election was anything
 
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
but stability it created
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
instability and as a result of it you
 
02:17:18.990 --> 02:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
took away people's rights to vote which
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
I find abhorent
 
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's constitutional I
 
02:17:25.950 --> 02:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
think it's wrong on its surface but
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
because the county is a creature of the
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
state this the county the legislation
 
02:17:31.549 --> 02:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
can do what it wants with it and I get
 
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
that I get that but you have to ask
 
02:17:36.509 --> 02:17:36.519 align:start position:0%
yourself a question which never happens
 
02:17:38.669 --> 02:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
here most of the time when you take an
 
02:17:41.070 --> 02:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
action you never revisit it to think
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
what what was the result of that
 
02:17:45.309 --> 02:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
action I can tell you what the result of
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
the action was this time you ended up
 
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
with two County Commissioners from Dover
 
02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
and I can also tell you in the future
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
you'll either e going to have two County
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from DOA or two County
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from Rochester because
 
02:17:57.870 --> 02:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
that's the way they divided it up in
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
this present
 
02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
scheme in an attempt in a political
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to get me
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
removed and I told them well maybe that
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
should be up to the vot is to decide
 
02:18:09.709 --> 02:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
whether they want me removed or
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
not in the end they never even feel that
 
02:18:15.709 --> 02:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
a candidate against me their own party
 
02:18:15.719 --> 02:18:17.910 align:start position:0%
a candidate against me their own party
nominated

02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
nominated
 
02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
me so what's so so what's this all about
 
02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
I mean in the in the end what's serving
 
02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
the public here in straford County if
 
02:18:27.389 --> 02:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
they really want to know how people
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
straford County feel I I received
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of phone calls
 
02:18:31.389 --> 02:18:31.399 align:start position:0%
from people who've been voting for me
 
02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years who couldn't vote for
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
me anymore and they were confused they
 
02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
didn't think I was running anymore there
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
was a lot of confusion there's still a
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion and that confusion
 
02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
remains if they're really interested in
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
doing what the people of straford County
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
want put a referendum pass a bip force a
 
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
referendum on the people of straford
 
02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
County as to whether they want this or
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
not or ask the county delegation like we
 
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
historically done in this state for
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
decades and decades and decades as to
 
02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
how they wish to have their County
 
02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:57.549 align:start position:0%
how they wish to have their County
Commissioners

02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
elected that's a simple way to to solve
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
the problem politically and I'll accept
 
02:19:05.469 --> 02:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
any result that that comes of it but to
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
do this back door this back door
 
02:19:07.479 --> 02:19:08.469 align:start position:0%
do this back door this back door
political

02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
political
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
maneuvering doesn't serve our state well
 
02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't serve the people of straford
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
County that I've represented for 42
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
years correctly actually for 50 years if
 
02:19:19.309 --> 02:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
you get right down to it 48 40 almost 49
 
02:19:19.319 --> 02:19:21.389 align:start position:0%
you get right down to it 48 40 almost 49
years

02:19:21.389 --> 02:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:19:23.389 --> 02:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
I believe the historical way we do we've
 
02:19:26.190 --> 02:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
done business in this state makes
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
sense and it should be returned to that
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
and if the county delegation wants to
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
change it they should come to the
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
legislature and tell you so if there's
 
02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
such a human cry to change the way
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
things are done in straford just like
 
02:19:40.830 --> 02:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
this problem that you're got in
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
Grafton all these things have been done
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
over the course of history because of
 
02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:46.030 align:start position:0%
over the course of history because of
political

02:19:46.030 --> 02:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
political
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
retribution and that's just the facts
 
02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
you look at it historically that are the
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
facts so now we sit here every few years
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
and we try to straighten it
 
02:19:59.550 --> 02:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
out that's what we try to do so in any
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
event Madam chairman I've spoke long
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
enough but that disenfranchise of those
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
990,000 voters really irritates me more
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
than anything I don't care about me okay
 
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
whether I serve or not serve at this
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
point I'm too old but the bottom line is
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is those people are
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising you and the legislature
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
took away their right and I find that
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
important so with that Madam chairman
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%

will be beginning with our um Bill
 
03:32:03.750 --> 03:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
noticed for
 
03:32:06.550 --> 03:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
1M before I open the hearing on that
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill I would like to remind everybody
 
03:32:11.870 --> 03:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
that in order to stay on schedule today

minutes for Bill introduction followed
 
03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
by questions and answers and then up to
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%

allotted for questions and answers if
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
the speaker allows the vice chair will
 
03:32:33.269 --> 03:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
be keeping track of time due to the fact
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we have uh a number of pink cards
 
03:32:39.950 --> 03:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
so when you the time has
 
03:32:42.870 --> 03:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
expired he will note that by holding up
 
03:32:46.389 --> 03:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
a pink card in at which point I we would
 
03:32:49.710 --> 03:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
ask that you um conclude your
 
03:32:52.429 --> 03:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
testimony and if a speaker has written
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
testimony please indicate such and
 
03:32:58.110 --> 03:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
distribute it to representative kazinski
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll pass that around the
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
table additionally if a speaker has more
 
03:33:04.510 --> 03:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
information that they wish to share with
 
03:33:07.870 --> 03:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
the committee then also let us know and
 
03:33:10.750 --> 03:33:10.760 align:start position:0%

03:33:32.080 --> 03:33:34.229 align:start position:0%
would like to say with regards to House
Bill

03:33:34.229 --> 03:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:33:38.030 --> 03:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
123 the me the the matter before us is
 
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
the Bold language so it is the changes
 
03:33:46.070 --> 03:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
to RSA 795 so to be clear we are not not
 
03:33:49.990 --> 03:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
here to um to get input and have a
 
03:33:53.070 --> 03:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on the carbon sequestration
 
03:33:59.870 --> 03:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
program per se it is the bill is about
 
03:34:04.030 --> 03:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
taxing wood or Timber that is enrolled
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the carbon sequestration
 
03:34:10.269 --> 03:34:10.279 align:start position:0%
program so I just wanted to make that
 
03:34:14.110 --> 03:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
that clear so that your um testimony is
 
03:34:17.950 --> 03:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:20.469 --> 03:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
so at this time I will open the public
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on House
 
03:34:26.710 --> 03:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 123 enabling municipalities to tax
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
standing wood and Timber on land used
 
03:34:32.670 --> 03:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.910 --> 03:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
sequestration the chair would like to
 
03:34:37.550 --> 03:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Davis the prime
 
03:34:39.189 --> 03:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this
 
03:34:41.550 --> 03:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
legislation good afternoon and welcome
 
03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh members of the
 
03:34:53.070 --> 03:34:53.080 align:start position:0%

District
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
2 a total disclosure I'm I'm an old hick
 
03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
from northern Coos so the the testimony
 
03:35:13.229 --> 03:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
you're about to hear probably won't be
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
as polished as the people coming behind
 
03:35:16.269 --> 03:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
me but I'll try my best to muddle
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
through this I'm here to introduce House
 
03:35:22.750 --> 03:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 123 it's a simple bill that does
 
03:35:25.870 --> 03:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
one thing it adds carbon sequestration
 
03:35:25.880 --> 03:35:26.670 align:start position:0%
one thing it adds carbon sequestration
to

03:35:26.670 --> 03:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:35:30.750 --> 03:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 79 which is Timber tax does not
 
03:35:33.229 --> 03:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
create a new tax but simply adds carbon
 
03:35:36.189 --> 03:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
projects to the yield tax section of RSA
 
03:35:39.790 --> 03:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
79 semicolon 3 this bill does not
 
03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to change RSA 79 in any other
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
way except for adding carbon projects to
 
03:35:49.790 --> 03:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
align with Timber harvesting allowing
 
03:35:52.349 --> 03:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
for carbon projects to pay their fair
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
share in New Hampshire standing Timber
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
on large wood Lots is considered part of
 
03:36:01.269 --> 03:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
the real estate it has a value that is
 
03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
taxable and would show up on your yearly
 
03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:05.550 align:start position:0%
taxable and would show up on your yearly
property

03:36:05.550 --> 03:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:36:08.150 --> 03:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
tax before Timber
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
tax the assessing officials would Cruise
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
these properties each year and assess
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
the value of the standing Timber
 
03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine this was very
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and probably not very
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
accurate also some Property Owners would
 
03:36:27.910 --> 03:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
actually clearcut to as a way to
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
circumvent paying the property taxes
 
03:36:32.550 --> 03:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
grossly mismanaging their
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
forest in order to remedy these problems
 
03:36:40.030 --> 03:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
Timber tax RSA 79 was enacted instead of
 
03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
assessing the the standing Timber each
 
03:36:44.630 --> 03:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
year you would only be taxed on the
 
03:36:47.590 --> 03:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
timber when you did a Timber Harvest at
 
03:36:50.670 --> 03:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
that time you would pay a 10% yield tax
 
03:36:53.950 --> 03:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
not a severance tax but a yield tax this
 
03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
made things much simpler for the
 
03:36:58.830 --> 03:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
assessing officials and the system was
 
03:37:00.670 --> 03:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
much more
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
accurate so this worked well for 75
 
03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
years now there's another way of doing
 
03:37:09.309 --> 03:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
business it's also a way for the land
 
03:37:11.469 --> 03:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
owners to circumvent from paying their
 
03:37:14.429 --> 03:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
tax on the standing Timber now let me be
 
03:37:15.870 --> 03:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
clear about this there is nothing
 
03:37:18.309 --> 03:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
illegal about
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
this it's just a
 
03:37:23.229 --> 03:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
loophole if you enter into a carbon
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
project you enter into an agreement to
 
03:37:28.870 --> 03:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
either not cut the standing timber for a
 
03:37:30.510 --> 03:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
certain period of time or at least
 
03:37:33.389 --> 03:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
greatly reduce these Timber Cuts if your
 
03:37:36.269 --> 03:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
deal is with the California compliance
 
03:37:39.269 --> 03:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
market then the contracts are for a 100
 
03:37:42.750 --> 03:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
years this means a carbon project this
 
03:37:44.830 --> 03:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
means as carbon projects become more
 
03:37:47.550 --> 03:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
popular the loss of Timber tax will
 
03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
create a hardship for many towns in New
 
03:37:53.150 --> 03:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill bill intends to keep
 
03:37:55.870 --> 03:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:59.670 --> 03:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
Hall New Hampshire is 84% forested we
 
03:38:01.469 --> 03:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
are the second most forested state in
 
03:38:04.830 --> 03:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
the Union per capita behind Maine this
 
03:38:07.189 --> 03:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
is not by accident it's from proper
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
forestry management I'd salute any any
 
03:38:12.429 --> 03:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
Forester in the room here today for the
 
03:38:13.429 --> 03:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
work they've
 
03:38:15.870 --> 03:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
done we do not only man manage our
 
03:38:18.790 --> 03:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
forest for wood products industry we
 
03:38:21.150 --> 03:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
also manage for wildlife habitat for
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
recreation for forest fire management
 
03:38:23.920 --> 03:38:25.429 align:start position:0%
recreation for forest fire management
and

03:38:25.429 --> 03:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
mitigation and so like before Timber tax
 
03:38:30.590 --> 03:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
when some land owners would clearcut
 
03:38:33.189 --> 03:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
their property to avoid paying taxes I
 
03:38:36.150 --> 03:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
believe not implementing best forestry
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
management practices by not being able
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
to harvest Timber due to carbon deals
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
could be equally as dangerous to the
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of New Hampshire's
 
03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:46.510 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of New Hampshire's
Forest

03:38:46.510 --> 03:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
Forest
 
03:38:48.429 --> 03:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is not intended to infringe
 
03:38:51.030 --> 03:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
upon landowner rights this bill simply
 
03:38:53.229 --> 03:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
would require you to pay the same yield
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
tax for the revenue you generate from
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
carbon sequestration in a similar manner
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
that you do when harvesting timber in
 
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
many cases the carbon credits are worth
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
more than the timber
 
03:39:10.510 --> 03:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
itself this bill does not attempt to
 
03:39:13.950 --> 03:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
alter RSA 79 in any way except to add
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
carbon sequestration to it all Ru making
 
03:39:19.990 --> 03:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
will remain the same certain
 
03:39:23.070 --> 03:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
forms like intent to cut may be intent
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
to sequester cabin uh you you when it
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
talks about stumpage it would be in this
 
03:39:33.750 --> 03:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
tonnage now there may be some not in
 
03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
support of this bill some people are not
 
03:39:40.990 --> 03:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of Timber tax at
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
all it's not that they actually oppose
 
03:39:46.030 --> 03:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
the bill they just want to pay the
 
03:39:49.349 --> 03:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
timber tax yet they enjoy the benefit of
 
03:39:51.790 --> 03:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
the assessing officials not assessing
 
03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
their standing Timber each year this
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill will move us forward to align
 
03:39:59.389 --> 03:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
carbon sequestration with Timber
 
03:40:02.110 --> 03:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
harvesting this bill has two main object
 
03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
objectives to keep municipalities whole
 
03:40:07.389 --> 03:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
with the loss of Timber tax and to allow
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting to be on a fair
 
03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
playing field with carbon projects
 
03:40:13.630 --> 03:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
protecting the economic development of
 
03:40:15.510 --> 03:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
the North country in the Tim Timber
 
03:40:18.510 --> 03:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:20.790 --> 03:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is very important to
 
03:40:23.790 --> 03:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
remember this is not a new tax it is
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
still Timber tax it is simply a way to
 
03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
keep a fairly new way of doing business
 
03:40:30.630 --> 03:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
from circumventing around paying their
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
property tax to the towns and to push
 
03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
for best forestry management
 
03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
practices so thank you and I would be
 
03:40:41.550 --> 03:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
03:40:43.630 --> 03:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
representative Davis I I had one quick
 
03:40:46.429 --> 03:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
question yes so um we have before us an
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill and I assume that
 
03:40:52.389 --> 03:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
your your bill introduction spoke to to
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
this to this amendment yes thank you
 
03:40:57.309 --> 03:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:59.590 --> 03:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative representative Gerard is
 
03:41:01.950 --> 03:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
03:41:03.429 --> 03:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative for
 
03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um looking through
 
03:41:08.910 --> 03:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
your bill I completely understand what
 
03:41:11.790 --> 03:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
what the purposes of this currently in
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
the I believe 795 or I apologize I got
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
the wrong number I'm pretty sure um that
 
03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
any standing Timber that does go to get
 
03:41:23.070 --> 03:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
to maturity that's not being cut there's
 
03:41:25.950 --> 03:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
still a possibility of getting 10% tax
 
03:41:28.030 --> 03:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
on that currently according to the law
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
is that correct thank you for your
 
03:41:32.189 --> 03:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
question yes that's exactly
 
03:41:32.199 --> 03:41:33.990 align:start position:0%
question yes that's exactly
correct

03:41:33.990 --> 03:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
so 795 it was it was too I looked at
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
that for so long and it was too messy to
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
put it there you have to the the
 
03:41:44.269 --> 03:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
assessing officials have to deem there's
 
03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
a shortfall they have to to uh figure
 
03:41:52.149 --> 03:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
that the the timber is mature there's so
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
many arguments to this that I thought it
 
03:41:56.229 --> 03:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
would be best to put it under the yield
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
tax section where it talks about when
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
you harvest your Timber you pay a 10%
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
yield and that's the payback the subsidy
 
03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
that the town has allowed you all these
 
03:42:08.550 --> 03:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
years of of not not going out and
 
03:42:10.830 --> 03:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
assessing your Timber like they used to
 
03:42:12.510 --> 03:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
so that that does have a place there
 
03:42:15.389 --> 03:42:15.399 align:start position:0%
it's never it it's never actually been
 
03:42:18.030 --> 03:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
invoked but uh and I spoke with Dr a
 
03:42:19.590 --> 03:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
number of times and they they find it
 
03:42:21.149 --> 03:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
hard it's very hard for them to deal
 
03:42:23.830 --> 03:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
with that the the way that's worded so I
 
03:42:27.389 --> 03:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
I think it's much cleaner being under 79
 
03:42:29.469 --> 03:42:29.479 align:start position:0%
it it's actually
 
03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
79 uh semicolon
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
3-c is where this would be implemented
 
03:42:38.990 --> 03:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
and it it's just much cleaner okay
 
03:42:42.189 --> 03:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
follow up yes but I I do have one one
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
comment so your question yeah did
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
pertain to the bill as written and I'm
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
not sure if he made the connection but
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
he spoke to the amendment and that's
 
03:42:54.750 --> 03:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
where that reference of the 79 colon 3C
 
03:42:59.790 --> 03:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
comes in okay okay so yes followup um as
 
03:43:01.670 --> 03:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
again I'm assuming this studies out
 
03:43:05.830 --> 03:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
there how much um Timber has it been cut
 
03:43:07.550 --> 03:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
back since that I believe we just
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
started it was 2013 they started using
 
03:43:11.070 --> 03:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
sequestration up there I just was
 
03:43:13.950 --> 03:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
curious if we know um there's people
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
behind me that are going to have some
 
03:43:19.590 --> 03:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
figures but but historically before 2013
 
03:43:21.070 --> 03:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
I want to say on
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
average um it it wasn't the current
 
03:43:26.429 --> 03:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
owners that own it now but it was
 
03:43:27.870 --> 03:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
another owner when he they got into
 
03:43:31.469 --> 03:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
carbon sequestration before that the the
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
average cut I believe was around
 
03:43:36.910 --> 03:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
$175,000 a year that they paid in Timber
 
03:43:41.149 --> 03:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
tax to the town of Pittsburgh now also
 
03:43:44.349 --> 03:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
stewartown in Clarkville this property
 
03:43:46.030 --> 03:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
covers those too so I don't know the
 
03:43:49.309 --> 03:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
figures to those towns so Pittsburgh a
 
03:43:50.670 --> 03:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
town of 800
 
03:43:53.990 --> 03:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
people uh to take a loss of
 
03:43:57.630 --> 03:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
$175,000 a year off one parcel that's 5%
 
03:44:00.990 --> 03:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
of their budget so that's a big hit the
 
03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
town has two choices they can cut their
 
03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
budget by
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
$175,000 or they can bump up the 800
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
people's property tax to make up for the
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
subsidy that is that's not being paid
 
03:44:15.149 --> 03:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
back here it's not like I said it's
 
03:44:17.149 --> 03:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
nothing illegal it's just a loophole
 
03:44:20.590 --> 03:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
that's that needs to be closed up for to
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
put carbon sequestration on the same
 
03:44:25.469 --> 03:44:25.479 align:start position:0%
playing field with Timber
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
harvesting thank you for your answer
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah further
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair um thank you
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just trying
 
03:44:41.359 --> 03:44:43.710 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just trying
to

03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:44:47.870 --> 03:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:51.550 --> 03:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
point homeowners uh small properties can
 
03:44:53.710 --> 03:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
utilize carbon
 
03:44:53.720 --> 03:44:57.910 align:start position:0%
utilize carbon
sequestration

03:44:57.910 --> 03:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.429 --> 03:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
um how do you not apply this une in
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
unequally you know if I if I have 10
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
acres um and I choose not
 
03:45:12.670 --> 03:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
to I choose to enroll it but I'm also
 
03:45:15.550 --> 03:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
paying property tax on my home
 
03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
portion uh the rest is in current use
 
03:45:22.710 --> 03:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
and how do I know that I'm not going to
 
03:45:26.189 --> 03:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
be subject to this when I'm only have 10
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
acres versus someone who may have
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
2,000 thank you for your
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
question I so you're let's say you have
 
03:45:37.469 --> 03:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
10 acres and you do a Timber Harvest
 
03:45:40.389 --> 03:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay 10% Timber tax on
 
03:45:42.189 --> 03:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
that on that
 
03:45:46.189 --> 03:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
Harvest uh if you do a cin project why
 
03:45:48.870 --> 03:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you do the same I I just think
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
it it should be fair across the board
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
and what these small Apostles like
 
03:45:56.070 --> 03:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
that I I guess you could bundle them up
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
but I I uh not so worried about that if
 
03:46:01.750 --> 03:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
you go to Northern Coos you can find a
 
03:46:04.750 --> 03:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
10,000 acre pel of land pretty handily
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
and those are the ones that that down
 
03:46:08.670 --> 03:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
the road what's going to happen if
 
03:46:10.269 --> 03:46:10.279 align:start position:0%
everybody goes to a Cobin first
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
initiative what's going to happen to the
 
03:46:16.269 --> 03:46:16.279 align:start position:0%
the timber industry so
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're still cutting the same amount of
 
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
wood whether it's
 
03:46:21.870 --> 03:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
locally the wood products industry is
 
03:46:23.469 --> 03:46:23.479 align:start position:0%
not going away we need lumber we need
 
03:46:25.830 --> 03:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
furniture we need toilet paper we need
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know anything that's made from from
 
03:46:27.600 --> 03:46:29.229 align:start position:0%
you know anything that's made from from
wood

03:46:29.229 --> 03:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
wood
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
so I'll give you an example in my
 
03:46:34.229 --> 03:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
hometown of my there's a company called
 
03:46:34.239 --> 03:46:35.110 align:start position:0%
hometown of my there's a company called
myin

03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
myin
 
03:46:37.229 --> 03:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
Lumber I don't know I should know the
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
number of people they employ it's quite
 
03:46:42.790 --> 03:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
a few and they used to procure 20% of
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
their lumber from Pittsburgh it's been a
 
03:46:46.750 --> 03:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
couple years they haven't gotten any
 
03:46:49.229 --> 03:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
lumber from Pittsburgh which is locally
 
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
so now they're they're figuring ways to
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
bring this the same amount of logs from
 
03:46:58.830 --> 03:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
New York by Rail and by truck into milin
 
03:46:58.840 --> 03:46:59.630 align:start position:0%
New York by Rail and by truck into milin
New

03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:46:59.640 --> 03:47:01.469 align:start position:0%
New
Hampshire

03:47:01.469 --> 03:47:01.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
so until they they got this process
 
03:47:06.870 --> 03:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
working they were down to four days a
 
03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
week so if you work there you missed out
 
03:47:13.469 --> 03:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
on on 52 days of work last year which is
 
03:47:15.229 --> 03:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
a pretty big hit for somebody in small
 
03:47:16.750 --> 03:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
town like that for
 
03:47:16.760 --> 03:47:18.830 align:start position:0%
town like that for
anybody

03:47:18.830 --> 03:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:47:22.349 --> 03:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
so I I can't imagine I mean arguably
 
03:47:24.510 --> 03:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
Trucking those logs from New York to mil
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire when you used to get
 
03:47:28.149 --> 03:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
them next door has to be offsetting
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's called leakage they have to be
 
03:47:31.710 --> 03:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
offsetting the the credits you're
 
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
getting from from carbon sequestration I
 
03:47:35.680 --> 03:47:37.870 align:start position:0%
getting from from carbon sequestration I
I

03:47:37.870 --> 03:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
know I hope I answered your
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:47:52.590 --> 03:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
gr thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:47:55.389 --> 03:47:55.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um do you know
 
03:47:57.790 --> 03:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
what the percentag is of this land
 
03:48:00.670 --> 03:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
that's owned by corporations versus
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
individuals I I do not know that I I
 
03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
mean and I'm not picking on this this
 
03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
prop it just happens to be this is
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
146,000 acre parcel it's the largest
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
single parcel in New Hampshire and it's
 
03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
it's an easy target I uh because it's in
 
03:48:18.469 --> 03:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
the news from you know all these figures
 
03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.590 --> 03:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
answer representative frock is
 
03:48:28.870 --> 03:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair representative Davis thank
 
03:48:35.910 --> 03:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
you for coming um as I understand
 
03:48:41.950 --> 03:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
it uh if I own 1100 Acres of Timber when
 
03:48:45.550 --> 03:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
I harvested that Timber after
 
03:48:48.149 --> 03:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
what 10 20 30 years depending on the
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
species I would pay the yield tax is
 
03:48:54.990 --> 03:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct uh followup
 
03:48:59.870 --> 03:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
yes if I put that same 1100 Acres of
 
03:48:59.880 --> 03:49:02.110 align:start position:0%
yes if I put that same 1100 Acres of
Timberland

03:49:02.110 --> 03:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
Timberland
 
03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
into um the carbon sequestration
 
03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
program how often would I be taxed on it
 
03:49:15.070 --> 03:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
would it be every year or every 20 years
 
03:49:17.550 --> 03:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
or how is that going to work it you
 
03:49:20.910 --> 03:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
would be taxed when there is a yield
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
so some there's a lot of differences a
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
lot lot of diff every contract may be a
 
03:49:31.149 --> 03:49:31.159 align:start position:0%
little different but let's say you you
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
sequestered I'm just going to make up a
 
03:49:36.269 --> 03:49:36.279 align:start position:0%
number a thousand tons but you didn't
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
sell any you would report to the town
 
03:49:42.830 --> 03:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
you have a th000 tons sequestered the
 
03:49:45.309 --> 03:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
next year you do another thousand
 
03:49:48.670 --> 03:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
and you sell 1,800 then you would report
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
that to the town and you would you would
 
03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:53.319 --> 03:49:55.309 align:start position:0%
 
yield

03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
yield
 
03:49:58.030 --> 03:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
followup I'll allow a second followup
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so is this likely to
 
03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
even out the revenue stream for
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
towns well definitely with the loss of
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
Timber tax it it's going to be a high
 
03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
ship on most of at least in in Coos
 
03:50:19.710 --> 03:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
especially we have a lot of
 
03:50:22.510 --> 03:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places and that's there
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
some of them that's their major Revenue
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the commission there's a
 
03:50:28.469 --> 03:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner here that'll probably speak
 
03:50:30.670 --> 03:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
on this today how this is going to
 
03:50:35.070 --> 03:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
affect the unincorporated places but
 
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
definitely further
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:46.590 --> 03:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
you the chair now now calls um two
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
people that together that wish to um I
 
03:50:52.830 --> 03:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
provide testimony together and that
 
03:50:56.550 --> 03:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
would be Mr Mark Brady and Mr Ray Gorman
 
03:50:59.870 --> 03:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
and following that I will call Ms
 
03:50:59.880 --> 03:51:05.830 align:start position:0%
and following that I will call Ms
Meredith

03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.349 --> 03:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
Hatfield so good afternoon and welcome
 
03:51:17.229 --> 03:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
there we go good afternoon um thank you
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
for having us and to be listening to us
 
03:51:25.309 --> 03:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
so my name is Ray Gman I live in cook
 
03:51:28.870 --> 03:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I Am The District 3 County
 
03:51:31.349 --> 03:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
Commissioner but I'm here speaking with
 
03:51:33.469 --> 03:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
the County Commissioners all three of us
 
03:51:36.309 --> 03:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
unanimous in our thoughts and what this
 
03:51:40.030 --> 03:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
process is right now um one of the
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
things that that this bill for us is
 
03:51:44.040 --> 03:51:45.189 align:start position:0%
things that that this bill for us is
that

03:51:45.189 --> 03:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:51:45.199 --> 03:51:46.349 align:start position:0%
that
K

03:51:46.349 --> 03:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
K
 
03:51:50.229 --> 03:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
county is so heavily wooded and
 
03:51:53.110 --> 03:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
so lumbering has always been a major
 
03:51:57.110 --> 03:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
part of what we do we have the Mills we
 
03:51:59.630 --> 03:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
have everything that goes on around them
 
03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
and the actions that happen around them
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
with the roads being built Etc in K
 
03:52:07.790 --> 03:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
County we have
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
23 unincorporated towns and there's only
 
03:52:14.269 --> 03:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
two other Incorporated towns I or three
 
03:52:14.279 --> 03:52:15.309 align:start position:0%
two other Incorporated towns I or three
in

03:52:15.309 --> 03:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:52:18.990 --> 03:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
yeah in the whole state uh 26 is on okay
 
03:52:21.229 --> 03:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
Mark will back up some of the numbers
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
but these are towns with very little
 
03:52:27.630 --> 03:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
population but huge
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
Forest you know water streams all that
 
03:52:33.149 --> 03:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
stuff and they've been heavily this is
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
where lumbering has taken on for years
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
and years and these communities as we
 
03:52:41.590 --> 03:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
manage them on the county level the
 
03:52:45.389 --> 03:52:45.399 align:start position:0%
timberx is a large part of the revenue
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
from these unincorporated towns as well
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
as all the other communities that I'm
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
speaking about but I'm going to speak
 
03:52:52.950 --> 03:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
specifically today on on Incorporated
 
03:52:55.030 --> 03:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
towns what how would it affect that now
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns have fixed costs
 
03:53:00.590 --> 03:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
just like everybody else um
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
ambulance dispatching those are two huge
 
03:53:06.790 --> 03:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
costs all right and through the years
 
03:53:10.110 --> 03:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
the unincorporated towns there a the
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
dispatching dispatching and the
 
03:53:13.750 --> 03:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance services are all done by
 
03:53:16.710 --> 03:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
communities and communities working
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
together and like when we've gone to get
 
03:53:22.950 --> 03:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
money to upgrade our dispatch the county
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
has been very generous at three
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
different times they have provided the
 
03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
match for us on grants this money come
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
from the unincorporated towns who got
 
03:53:33.389 --> 03:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
their money from the timber tax all
 
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
right a huge part of what these
 
03:53:38.110 --> 03:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns get for revenues
 
03:53:40.670 --> 03:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
come from Timber
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
tax and we've already seen with and I'm
 
03:53:46.469 --> 03:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
on the board I'm on the 45th parallel
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
and the dispatch boards representing the
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
county and our costs are increasing
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
significantly just like everybody else
 
03:53:55.269 --> 03:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
you guys know all it's like to to
 
03:53:57.429 --> 03:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
provide those services but if we lose
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
our Revenue stream it's going to be a
 
03:54:03.870 --> 03:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
significant loss to us very important
 
03:54:07.229 --> 03:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
that you understand that and we believe
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
strongly here we what we seeing with the
 
03:54:12.070 --> 03:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
carbon that it's making us very nervous
 
03:54:14.110 --> 03:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
is that we believe it's it's basically a
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
complete change in forestry P practices
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see The Cutting and
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth but I'm talking about
 
03:54:22.790 --> 03:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
the revenue today so that reflects the
 
03:54:26.229 --> 03:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
revenues by we've already seen it in the
 
03:54:28.830 --> 03:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
upper connectic Connecticut headquarters
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
where the this that is part a big part
 
03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
of what's the headed Waters now the
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
carbon SE equation and The Cutting has
 
03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
decreased from 30,000 plus to down under
 
03:54:45.149 --> 03:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
I think last year was 50
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're seeing significant it's a carbon
 
03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
is credit forestry is a total different
 
03:54:53.429 --> 03:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
way of doing cutting so that's why we
 
03:54:54.630 --> 03:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's you know I don't want to get off
 
03:54:55.710 --> 03:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
base because I know what you said at
 
03:54:58.630 --> 03:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
your beginning remarks but if that
 
03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
involves the revenue that I'm talking
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
about now for unincorporated towns as
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
well as all those communities and the
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
significant effects like Berlin gorm the
 
03:55:11.950 --> 03:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
paper mills all right the um all those
 
03:55:14.910 --> 03:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
if you stop cutting the the um
 
03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
coold Generation all right the the type
 
03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
of wood that they use so on and so forth
 
03:55:23.790 --> 03:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
it will it's a for the northern part in
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
this region that I represent this is a
 
03:55:30.149 --> 03:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
major change and we we need to find a
 
03:55:32.910 --> 03:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
way we to me it's no different you know
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about taxing here that
 
03:55:35.640 --> 03:55:36.630 align:start position:0%
we're talking about taxing here that
already

03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
exist and taxing the wood okay revenue
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
is being made on this wood
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
from the carbon
 
03:55:46.600 --> 03:55:48.189 align:start position:0%
from the carbon
credits

03:55:48.189 --> 03:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
credits
 
03:55:48.199 --> 03:55:50.309 align:start position:0%
credits
okay

03:55:50.309 --> 03:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:55:52.750 --> 03:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
y just let me add something my name is
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh Mark Brady uh from Jefferson I'm the
 
03:55:58.590 --> 03:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
cost County Administrator uh to follow
 
03:56:00.070 --> 03:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
up on commissioner Gorman a little bit
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
and put into perspective so what
 
03:56:05.349 --> 03:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
obviously you know makes Coos unique is
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
that we have 23 of the 25 unincorporated
 
03:56:10.510 --> 03:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
places so we really are the center so to
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
speak of I like to say of of Land
 
03:56:15.870 --> 03:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
Management in the State uh uh Etc uh our
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
two main economies today are uh Timber
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
and our uh ohrv recreational use which
 
03:56:25.229 --> 03:56:25.239 align:start position:0%
between the two of them it's about uh5
 
03:56:28.429 --> 03:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
billion total to the state okay and and
 
03:56:31.229 --> 03:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
we drive a lot of that um regarding the
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places uh so we did an
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
analysis I was able to get back an
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
analysis done by my f by the finance
 
03:56:41.429 --> 03:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
department to go back to
 
03:56:46.349 --> 03:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
2009 and the the timber tax uh to the
 
03:56:48.429 --> 03:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
unincorporated budget over that time
 
03:56:51.910 --> 03:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
frame from 09 to to through this through
 
03:56:54.149 --> 03:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
last year is a 20 is
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
28% so if you were to conceivably start
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
to phase out
 
03:57:02.790 --> 03:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
of Timber harvesting and go into carbon
 
03:57:05.790 --> 03:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
sequestration that's 28% whole
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately that there in maybe less
 
03:57:11.070 --> 03:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
depending upon how fast you go uh that
 
03:57:13.349 --> 03:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
we lose uh and if you can you can
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
imagine that actually in 2009 uh uh
 
03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
Timber was 53% of of the budget's uh
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
revenue and now it's down to 28% and
 
03:57:26.590 --> 03:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
that kind of Segways into certainly
 
03:57:28.110 --> 03:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
what's happened and and you hear a lot
 
03:57:31.269 --> 03:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
about Connecticut Lake Headwaters and
 
03:57:33.070 --> 03:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
you hear about it a lot because it's
 
03:57:35.910 --> 03:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's the single largest private
 
03:57:38.910 --> 03:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
piece of property in the state 146,000
 
03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
acres and it's it's
 
03:57:44.550 --> 03:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
instrumental to the North country that's
 
03:57:48.189 --> 03:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
why Senators Greg and and former Senator
 
03:57:51.070 --> 03:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
Greg and then Governor Shaheen and and
 
03:57:53.349 --> 03:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
now uh Senator Shaheen decided to get
 
03:57:56.510 --> 03:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
$33 million of federal and state Monies
 
03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
to secure an easement to so that it
 
03:58:01.750 --> 03:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
would be a productive working forest and
 
03:58:03.910 --> 03:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
the to to go to I think one of the one
 
03:58:05.309 --> 03:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
of the representatives questions over
 
03:58:08.910 --> 03:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
here um so when they did that easement
 
03:58:12.550 --> 03:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
on that property on that property it was
 
03:58:15.149 --> 03:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
harvesting 40,000
 
03:58:17.269 --> 03:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh Charlie L can probably can probably
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
knows numbers better than me a little
 
03:58:21.790 --> 03:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
bit 40,000 uh cords a
 
03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
year you get into about 2010 2012 and
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
they register it with carb and you start
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
to see it starts to to descend down into
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
the 30s 30,000 courts uh why we've been
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
so exercised today is because that
 
03:58:39.030 --> 03:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
property alone well I'm not going to you
 
03:58:40.870 --> 03:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
know representative Davis mentioned the
 
03:58:43.510 --> 03:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
implications to Min number etc etc is
 
03:58:43.520 --> 03:58:44.550 align:start position:0%
implications to Min number etc etc is
now

03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:58:47.030 --> 03:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
probably less than 15,000 cords on an
 
03:58:48.870 --> 03:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
annual basis which has profound
 
03:58:53.510 --> 03:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
implications to us uh so to go to the
 
03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
point of the 10% what's fair would we be
 
03:58:59.189 --> 03:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
be made hold or not most likely we're
 
03:59:00.630 --> 03:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
not made whole at
 
03:59:04.110 --> 03:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
10% probably not okay with some of the
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
economists that that we've used we used
 
03:59:09.830 --> 03:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
in our response to the state on their
 
03:59:13.469 --> 03:59:13.479 align:start position:0%
lack of enforcement of the easement um
 
03:59:14.670 --> 03:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
and I think the another way you have to
 
03:59:16.510 --> 03:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
look at it as
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
well having a Timber economy where
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
you're cutting and you're taking you're
 
03:59:24.429 --> 03:59:24.439 align:start position:0%
taking product to Mills is different
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
than a carbon
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
sequestration economy so to speak based
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
on that which is a much more static type
 
03:59:35.870 --> 03:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
of uh existence for the uh uh for the
 
03:59:38.830 --> 03:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
property for sure uh and I I'm not going
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
to digress maybe uh others will I don't
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
want to digress into the implications of
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
carbon credit per se on all of this but
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
we're trying to be
 
03:59:52.630 --> 03:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
agnostic about carbon credit from a from
 
03:59:55.070 --> 03:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
a public policy perspective of doing
 
03:59:58.830 --> 03:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
budgets Etc we just want to make it all
 
04:00:02.510 --> 04:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
work just make it work but if you're
 
04:00:05.590 --> 04:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
going to go to a carbon credit carbon
 
04:00:05.600 --> 04:00:06.990 align:start position:0%
going to go to a carbon credit carbon
first

04:00:06.990 --> 04:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
economy then you're not going to be
 
04:00:11.790 --> 04:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
doing all the cutting that has a a
 
04:00:13.510 --> 04:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
trickle on effect actually it has a
 
04:00:17.229 --> 04:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
multip supplier of 2.3 so for every 100
 
04:00:21.269 --> 04:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
jobs you get in the timber industry you
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
have another
 
04:00:26.149 --> 04:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
230 in the in in the transitional
 
04:00:28.870 --> 04:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
Downstream you probably don't get that
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
with carbon sequestration I think that
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's probably a pretty fair uh
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
assumption we want to be agnostic and I
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
would I would leave you with this last
 
04:00:43.990 --> 04:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
point if you don't make if you leave the
 
04:00:45.750 --> 04:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
back door open this is how we view it
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
because we view it as your circumventing
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
the the state clearly 75 years ago said
 
04:00:53.149 --> 04:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
this is what we're going to do we're
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
going to extract that value that way and
 
04:00:58.990 --> 04:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
if you don't apply it to carbon you are
 
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
de facto incentivizing carbon you are
 
04:01:05.429 --> 04:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
you are incentivizing people to take the
 
04:01:08.070 --> 04:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
property and put it in carbon because
 
04:01:09.830 --> 04:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
well I don't you have to pay 10% why
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
would I not do that I mean the rational
 
04:01:14.309 --> 04:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
person would would do that other than
 
04:01:16.910 --> 04:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
for for obviously some of what would be
 
04:01:20.790 --> 04:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
good Forest management um but you know
 
04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
those are this is these issues cut to
 
04:01:25.830 --> 04:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
the core of us and it is about our tax
 
04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
base uh for sure it's about us at a
 
04:01:32.309 --> 04:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
county level you know performing our our
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
duties that we constitutionally have to
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
do we run two nursing homes we're the
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
only county in the state that does that
 
04:01:41.670 --> 04:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
Etc uh and you know look at the end of
 
04:01:45.550 --> 04:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
the day you know we say this coos is 20%
 
04:01:47.309 --> 04:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
of the land area of the state we're the
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
biggest County and we're 2% of the
 
04:01:55.070 --> 04:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
population and yet we are the identity
 
04:01:58.269 --> 04:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
of the state Every Which Way Mount
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
Washington is the most visited place in
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
this state Coos generates a million
 
04:02:05.070 --> 04:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
visitors a
 
04:02:09.670 --> 04:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
year now we're going to have this tax
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
that at least there's a direct line to
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
us if it's if it's if it's here in Coos
 
04:02:16.670 --> 04:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
and you go Harvest it you're going to
 
04:02:19.870 --> 04:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
pay that yield tax we know rooms and
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
meals we're generating over 100 over a
 
04:02:25.349 --> 04:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
million people that come to Coos rooms
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
and meals is based on 2% of the
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
population I mean I'm not I don't want
 
04:02:31.389 --> 04:02:31.399 align:start position:0%
to give you a sad story on that but my
 
04:02:31.399 --> 04:02:32.990 align:start position:0%
to give you a sad story on that but my
point

04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:02:36.510 --> 04:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
is this this is a
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
circumvention and this puts carbon if if
 
04:02:41.670 --> 04:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
you do not include it you're
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
incentivizing carbon over
 
04:02:44.479 --> 04:02:46.510 align:start position:0%
incentivizing carbon over
over

04:02:46.510 --> 04:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
harvested thank you for your testimonies
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:02:56.070 --> 04:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
FR thank you madam
 
04:02:56.080 --> 04:02:57.830 align:start position:0%
FR thank you madam
chair

04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:03:01.510 --> 04:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know an awful lot about the
 
04:03:05.550 --> 04:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
timber industry um but it would seem to
 
04:03:10.110 --> 04:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
me that at some point in the life of a
 
04:03:14.149 --> 04:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
woodlot the timber would reach a maximum
 
04:03:16.990 --> 04:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
growth and would need to be
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
harvested and if that is the case at
 
04:03:20.960 --> 04:03:22.229 align:start position:0%
harvested and if that is the case at
that

04:03:22.229 --> 04:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:25.630 --> 04:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
point the harvested Timber would be
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
taxed yet again so you're taxing it
 
04:03:35.630 --> 04:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
not oh the thing
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
about if you do not Harvest it okay and
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
it just all tumbles down
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
all right it becomes
 
04:03:50.189 --> 04:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
useless your for it hasn't been
 
04:03:53.309 --> 04:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
harvested and if you have normal Forest
 
04:03:55.389 --> 04:03:55.399 align:start position:0%
practices you were talking about 20 and
 
04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
30 years ago each time the they the
 
04:04:01.550 --> 04:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
incentive is whatever is on the ground
 
04:04:03.550 --> 04:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
that's keeping that carbon so they're
 
04:04:07.269 --> 04:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
not nowhere's near in a hurry to log May
 
04:04:10.750 --> 04:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 years they will harvest no as
 
04:04:13.990 --> 04:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
near as much as they would if there were
 
04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
a regular Forest under a regular Forest
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
program I I hope that makes sense yeah
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
and and just to we use a as a rule of
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
thumb for us and uh there are others
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
here that probably maybe can can answer
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
this better but you you enter into a car
 
04:04:32.469 --> 04:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
a carb contract which is what
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes is on okay which is
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's California Air Resource Board
 
04:04:39.429 --> 04:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
okay so you've imported that we've
 
04:04:42.189 --> 04:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
imported that that those priorities here
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so that requires I
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
believe a 100-year commitment on that
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
project so we view that as basically
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
three Cuts you know let's say every 30
 
04:04:54.429 --> 04:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
years you know whatever so it's it would
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
be three
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
Cuts additional
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions I had a a follow-up question
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
so to be clear under the uh carbon
 
04:05:09.429 --> 04:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
sequestration program it sounds like
 
04:05:12.149 --> 04:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
typically it's 100
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
years the timber
 
04:05:17.710 --> 04:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
tied up for a 100 years so to be clear
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's no cutting is that correct or
 
04:05:22.990 --> 04:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
can you cut no that's that's not correct
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
and I think I think either uh Mr Hackley
 
04:05:27.870 --> 04:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
or even uh Charlie Le can get into it
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
more there has to be some Forest
 
04:05:32.710 --> 04:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
management uh I think where the sticking
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
point is and it's an excellent question
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative because I think it's
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
really we I would I would pose that we
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
you as a state have not vetted all of
 
04:05:47.670 --> 04:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
this probably as clearly as it needs to
 
04:05:50.070 --> 04:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
be vetted so we all understand exactly
 
04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
where we are on this um but there is
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
some Forest management that's done but
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
then it it gets into the question of
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
well okay well what is it and what's
 
04:06:03.149 --> 04:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
proper and what's not and that was some
 
04:06:04.670 --> 04:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
of the that's certainly been some of the
 
04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
discussions if you would go to the the
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
the citizen uh the Connecticut
 
04:06:11.149 --> 04:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
headquarters citizens committee with
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
some of the discussion and you listen to
 
04:06:12.720 --> 04:06:14.349 align:start position:0%
some of the discussion and you listen to
Aurora's

04:06:14.349 --> 04:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
Aurora's
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
Forester and proper proper Forest
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
management I I have a feeling you can
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
have some on one extreme that are going
 
04:06:24.149 --> 04:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
to have very minimal there'll be others
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
probably that would be a little bit more
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
aggressive there is one other point
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's just gnawing here that was raised
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
by one of the representatives over here
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
and it was actually raised last year
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
when we testified and I don't think we
 
04:06:41.149 --> 04:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
we we've nowhere begun to grasp and
 
04:06:44.590 --> 04:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
there is the difference between
 
04:06:49.149 --> 04:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
the 100 Acre owner and for instance in
 
04:06:52.149 --> 04:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
the with us where we do have a we do
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
know the bigger pieces of property okay
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I can I didn't bring it with me but
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
certainly if you want that I'd be
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
prepared I can provide you with that you
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
can see it we see it okay we know where
 
04:07:05.149 --> 04:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
the the big pieces of property are and
 
04:07:08.750 --> 04:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we're scared about we don't
 
04:07:10.429 --> 04:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day if they want to do
 
04:07:12.990 --> 04:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
an aggregation and take up a and there
 
04:07:14.990 --> 04:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
are firms that do aggregate that get
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
smaller pieces of property and roll them
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
up together and that's that's not what
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about you have to
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
deal with the way you have to deal with
 
04:07:25.389 --> 04:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
it statutorily get it in Legally and and
 
04:07:27.149 --> 04:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
whatever but we're talking about the
 
04:07:30.149 --> 04:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
bigger pieces of property that will that
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
have begun to transform Coos by the lack
 
04:07:37.149 --> 04:07:37.159 align:start position:0%
of cutting in Connecticut lakes and it
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
won't take much you can take couple
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
pieces of property out of line and you
 
04:07:43.309 --> 04:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change everything and we
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
have haven't even discussed access to
 
04:07:49.870 --> 04:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
the property because you know there are
 
04:07:52.990 --> 04:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of these firms like
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
Aurora that you know they don't like the
 
04:07:58.510 --> 04:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
ohvs they create a lot of erosion they
 
04:08:01.469 --> 04:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
chew it up you know and so what's going
 
04:08:04.030 --> 04:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
to be their disposition Aurora said vert
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
on Trails will keep the existing Trails
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
we want no more Trails no more so I mean
 
04:08:11.389 --> 04:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
there thank you further
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so it
 
04:08:26.990 --> 04:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
might be a a couple parts for
 
04:08:27.000 --> 04:08:29.109 align:start position:0%
might be a a couple parts for
clarification

04:08:29.109 --> 04:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
the the people who own the land are they
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
individuals or corporations that you are
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
particularly talking about right now the
 
04:08:40.109 --> 04:08:40.119 align:start position:0%
bigger pieces of parcels by and large
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
are are comp corporations are
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
corporations okay because I was I was
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
wondering like if it's a person then
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
they're having a contract with
 
04:08:51.070 --> 04:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
California there's probably income on
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
that contract that they're paying tax on
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
so I trying to understand if this be a
 
04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
double tax to somebody if they're paying
 
04:09:00.590 --> 04:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
income and then this 10% yeah I'm sorry
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
I mean to interrupt you uh that's one of
 
04:09:04.910 --> 04:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
the questions about Aurora I think to be
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
honest with you that we've had over are
 
04:09:09.149 --> 04:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
they paying any tax at all okay part of
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
our issue was and why we had to go Coos
 
04:09:14.309 --> 04:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
was forced
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
to go get our attorneys to look at the
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the easement and see where we
 
04:09:20.429 --> 04:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
are in
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
2024 was
 
04:09:26.189 --> 04:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
that the most basic reporting on that
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
has not been done by the property owners
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
and the ones before before even Aurora
 
04:09:32.910 --> 04:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:09:37.229 --> 04:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
state so I don't it's a fair
 
04:09:40.469 --> 04:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
question additional
 
04:09:43.109 --> 04:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:09:43.119 --> 04:09:44.710 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair would like to
 
04:09:48.870 --> 04:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
call Representative ulette and I do
 
04:09:52.910 --> 04:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
apologize your card was hiding and we
 
04:09:57.109 --> 04:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
have a um precedent where we call upon
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
Representatives first so that if they
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
have business that they're tending to in
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
other committees they they can get back
 
04:10:06.349 --> 04:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
to that so welcome to Municipal and
 
04:10:06.359 --> 04:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
to that so welcome to Municipal and
County

04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.070 --> 04:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
government thank you madam chair and
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee members uh you've made my day
 
04:10:15.630 --> 04:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
I've never been accused of
 
04:10:17.950 --> 04:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
hiding I'll be very
 
04:10:21.149 --> 04:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
brief uh House Bill 123
 
04:10:24.510 --> 04:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
hb13 is in addition to irsa 79 the the
 
04:10:28.149 --> 04:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
timber tax and it needs to be changed uh
 
04:10:30.109 --> 04:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
to keep up on our current times the
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
timber tax was
 
04:10:33.630 --> 04:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
originally uh conceived and instituted
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the 40s it was a creative way to deal
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
with standing
 
04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
Timber and uh is continued to work well
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
allowing Timber owners to avoid the
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
yield tax on the timber until the timber
 
04:10:43.840 --> 04:10:44.790 align:start position:0%
yield tax on the timber until the timber
is

04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
cut um our world has and continues to
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
change hp23 is nothing more than a
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
reflection of today's varying Timber
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
Market when you sell your carbon in
 
04:10:55.750 --> 04:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
Woodland excuse me when you sell your
 
04:10:58.109 --> 04:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
carbon in your wood lot in essence
 
04:11:00.750 --> 04:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
you're selling the trees without cutting
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
them uh the trees are tied up anywhere
 
04:11:05.030 --> 04:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
from 40 to 100 years which is about two
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
to three Harvest Cycles in the average
 
04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire wood lot in late in the
 
04:11:12.990 --> 04:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
late 1800s and early 1900s New Hampshire
 
04:11:16.070 --> 04:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
was over 90% cleared land today we're
 
04:11:18.670 --> 04:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
over 80% forested our Foresters have
 
04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
done a great job managing our our
 
04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
forests the bill keeps the town's whole
 
04:11:25.469 --> 04:11:25.479 align:start position:0%
by collecting Revenue created by selling
 
04:11:27.550 --> 04:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
the carbon if you do not collect the
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
carbon the if you do not collect on the
 
04:11:33.189 --> 04:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
carbon sales just as if it was harvested
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
Timber the other taxpayers in town are
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
essentially subsidizing the Timberland
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
owners through higher property
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
taxes this is a very
 
04:11:44.189 --> 04:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
complex uh
 
04:11:47.790 --> 04:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
topic uh this is a another part of the
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
carbon industry we're trying to work
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
through last year representative Davis
 
04:11:56.070 --> 04:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
and myself uh um wrote A bill had it uh
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
signed into law to set up a registry in
 
04:12:00.189 --> 04:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that people who are
 
04:12:03.149 --> 04:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
selling Carbon on their Timberlands have
 
04:12:05.429 --> 04:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
to sign in this registry because we have
 
04:12:09.309 --> 04:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
no idea who's part of the uh carbon
 
04:12:12.389 --> 04:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
sales uh we have no idea who's uh
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
sequestering their car carbon we have no
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
idea who it's being sold to we have no
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
idea what the value is we have no idea
 
04:12:22.269 --> 04:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
if these companies that a California
 
04:12:24.269 --> 04:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
company is buying the carbon selling it
 
04:12:26.710 --> 04:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
to a Michigan company holding land in
 
04:12:29.550 --> 04:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if they're even paying the
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire business s the New
 
04:12:34.269 --> 04:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business tax we have no idea
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
so last year was the first step is to
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
was to set up a registry so we know
 
04:12:38.750 --> 04:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
who's in the carbon
 
04:12:43.870 --> 04:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
game um and uh and it's passed um
 
04:12:43.880 --> 04:12:44.950 align:start position:0%
game um and uh and it's passed um
this

04:12:44.950 --> 04:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:12:48.189 --> 04:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
year um you know this is the next part
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
of it uh as one of the representatives
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
had asked if you sell your uh get paid
 
04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
for selling your your carbon and then
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
you sell your Timber do you pay the tax
 
04:13:03.070 --> 04:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
twice absolutely and I'll tell you why
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
because you sold your Timber once to as
 
04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
carbon you've sold it you've collected
 
04:13:07.040 --> 04:13:07.750 align:start position:0%
carbon you've sold it you've collected
your

04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:13:10.269 --> 04:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
money 50 years 80 years later when you
 
04:13:12.510 --> 04:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
cut your Timber you've sold it again so
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
youve sold that actual piece of Timber
 
04:13:17.109 --> 04:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
twice and you've gained income twice you
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
should pay the tax
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
twice um sequestering carbon is just a
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
new way to sell your Timber so let's
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
pass hb123 and let RSA 79-5 the timber
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
tax continue to do its job thank you
 
04:13:34.469 --> 04:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
very much and I glad to take any
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Vette
 
04:13:38.590 --> 04:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
04:13:40.910 --> 04:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative representative Colby is
 
04:13:42.750 --> 04:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
madam CH thank you representative
 
04:13:46.080 --> 04:13:47.910 align:start position:0%
madam CH thank you representative
um

04:13:47.910 --> 04:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
how can a property simultaneously exist
 
04:13:56.670 --> 04:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
under current use status as well as
 
04:13:59.790 --> 04:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
being enrolled in a carbon sequestration
 
04:13:59.800 --> 04:14:01.429 align:start position:0%
being enrolled in a carbon sequestration
program

04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:14:05.109 --> 04:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely um and the
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
um as representive Davis had mentioned
 
04:14:10.750 --> 04:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
we're not so concerned with a mom and
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
popop piece of land at 30 40 acres it's
 
04:14:15.510 --> 04:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's a bigger guys that are are part of
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
it but it it does concern everybody and
 
04:14:19.309 --> 04:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
it is I disagree with some of our
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
previous speakers this is a Statewide
 
04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
property a Statewide issue it's not just
 
04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
a North Country issue because there are
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of property owners in the southern
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
part of the state with 500 to Thousand
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
Acres and it's going to affect us
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
all um uh current use is a great thing
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
and and uh that was put in to give the
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
owners of their property the
 
04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
availability to keep them without losing
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
them to taxes um and it's very possible
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
possible to have a piece of property
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
that uh part of your timers and uh in
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
the carbon program and part of it is
 
04:14:53.389 --> 04:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
just a standard um Harvest program like
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
we have today um that the the property
 
04:14:58.030 --> 04:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
owners have property rights and they
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
04:15:03.149 --> 04:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
protected but at the same time uh we
 
04:15:05.349 --> 04:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
need to protect our our our towns and
 
04:15:07.469 --> 04:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
and like I said I think that the carbon
 
04:15:10.269 --> 04:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
uh is just uh an evolution of the Timber
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
business and um should be still
 
04:15:17.830 --> 04:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:20.469 --> 04:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
795 additional
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:15:25.630 --> 04:15:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
much next the chair recognizes executive
 
04:15:29.359 --> 04:15:33.389 align:start position:0%
much next the chair recognizes executive
counselor

04:15:33.389 --> 04:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
Kenny welcome to Municipal and County
 
04:15:38.269 --> 04:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
government thank you it's been a
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
while for the record uh my name is Joe
 
04:15:42.670 --> 04:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
Kenny district one executive counselor
 
04:15:42.680 --> 04:15:43.429 align:start position:0%
Kenny district one executive counselor
so

04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:45.550 --> 04:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
I represent from the Canadian border all
 
04:15:46.870 --> 04:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
the way down to the University New
 
04:15:49.469 --> 04:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Durham so you can imagine
 
04:15:51.550 --> 04:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
my uh representative seat is very
 
04:15:53.710 --> 04:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
Diversified and you know broken down
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
into three distinct regions and one of
 
04:15:58.349 --> 04:15:58.359 align:start position:0%
those regions is a North Country but I
 
04:16:01.070 --> 04:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
also represent Carol County bellnap and
 
04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
parts of Grafton and so land is
 
04:16:07.950 --> 04:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
plentiful and so this topic of uh carbon
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
sequestration wasn't even a topic um
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
five years ago in New Hampshire
 
04:16:14.830 --> 04:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
but because of the Connecticut
 
04:16:17.469 --> 04:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
Headwaters property it kind of sounded
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
the alarm um that if we can't Harvest
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
our land or if we can't assess uh carbon
 
04:16:30.429 --> 04:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
sequestration um then forever our uh
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
woodland culture and economy is forever
 
04:16:36.510 --> 04:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
changed and so what is New Hampshire and
 
04:16:37.830 --> 04:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire a lot of the
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
economy is based off of logging wood
 
04:16:43.990 --> 04:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
products um low energy power plants we
 
04:16:48.910 --> 04:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
rely heavily on on the uh Forest economy
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
so when I testified on a bill over a
 
04:16:55.710 --> 04:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
year ago in my testimony I I thought it
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
was necessary to have a registry to
 
04:17:00.109 --> 04:17:00.119 align:start position:0%
bring out the fact that who was
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
participating in the carbon offset tax
 
04:17:05.349 --> 04:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
credit program because I was curious I
 
04:17:07.590 --> 04:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to know what was the incentive
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
and what I found out was that our state
 
04:17:13.710 --> 04:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
you know 84% Forest
 
04:17:13.720 --> 04:17:14.870 align:start position:0%
you know 84% Forest
California

04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
California
 
04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
33% Nevada in the low
 
04:17:20.910 --> 04:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
teens North Dakota South Dakota two 2
 
04:17:24.109 --> 04:17:24.119 align:start position:0%
and 3% that suddenly the Northeast was a
 
04:17:27.149 --> 04:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
target for this program because we have
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
effectively managed our forest in a
 
04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
great way over the years and there's a
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
lot of prospecting going on in our state
 
04:17:37.030 --> 04:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
currently I believe there's about 10
 
04:17:39.269 --> 04:17:39.279 align:start position:0%
people that are on the registry or
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
companies that are part of this um
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
carbon offset tax tax credit program so
 
04:17:46.590 --> 04:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
that let you know that there are large
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
swaps of land that are in this program
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
already that have long-term contracts
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
that until about two years ago or a year
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
and a half ago we knew nothing about it
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the state that would be like saying
 
04:18:03.070 --> 04:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
that the current use program in the
 
04:18:05.550 --> 04:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that no one would
 
04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
know which property owners were in
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
current use that was the equivalent and
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
we all know we can go into our town hall
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
and look up who is in current use with
 
04:18:19.070 --> 04:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
our local neighbor and we know that our
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
local guy has got to get intent to cut
 
04:18:24.550 --> 04:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
and they have to check in with the local
 
04:18:27.309 --> 04:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
assessor in the town hall to make sure
 
04:18:28.950 --> 04:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's all in the up and up and
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
furthermore it goes to dncr and the uh
 
04:18:35.109 --> 04:18:35.119 align:start position:0%
force and land to make sure the Dr and
 
04:18:36.910 --> 04:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
everybody's informed of this intent to
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
cut and that it's it's carried through
 
04:18:39.760 --> 04:18:40.750 align:start position:0%
cut and that it's it's carried through
very

04:18:40.750 --> 04:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
transparent very understandable it's
 
04:18:45.070 --> 04:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
been around since
 
04:18:48.309 --> 04:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
1949 we knew nothing about carbon offset
 
04:18:50.910 --> 04:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
tax credit program that was transported
 
04:18:53.950 --> 04:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire it's this Market that
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
they've created for carbon sequestration
 
04:18:58.510 --> 04:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
and apparently there's there are a few
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
folks out there who want to make a
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
killing on it unfortunately it's
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
impacted our culture in Northern New
 
04:19:06.109 --> 04:19:06.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and around the
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
state so my sense is this is
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
fairness fairness fairness fairness that
 
04:19:15.870 --> 04:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
the local municipalities have a way to
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
assess the carbon sequestration registry
 
04:19:22.269 --> 04:19:22.279 align:start position:0%
program so that the fair revenue is
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
brought to the town and that folks and
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
who own large swaps of land do not
 
04:19:29.910 --> 04:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
Escape their responsibility of providing
 
04:19:32.269 --> 04:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
a yield tax to that municipality that's
 
04:19:34.109 --> 04:19:34.119 align:start position:0%
all we're really looking for when I look
 
04:19:36.269 --> 04:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
at this bill here it's a fairness bill
 
04:19:39.550 --> 04:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
that's all it is because um the Town
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
Administrator from C County Mark Brady
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
made the point there would be a lot of
 
04:19:46.830 --> 04:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
people who like to escape that tax who
 
04:19:49.349 --> 04:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
would participate in this program and
 
04:19:51.870 --> 04:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
they would like to tie up the forest and
 
04:19:54.109 --> 04:19:54.119 align:start position:0%
they like to make their money they
 
04:19:55.630 --> 04:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't contribute to the local
 
04:19:57.790 --> 04:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
community they wouldn't pay the fair
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
share and they would make more money and
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
profit well we just want fairness
 
04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
through this bill throughout the state
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
and I would also like to
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
add that
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
um I think when you look at New
 
04:20:15.870 --> 04:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and where we're at in many
 
04:20:18.510 --> 04:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
ways we're leading the nation on policy
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
changes on this particular new economy
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
the carbon offset tax credit economy if
 
04:20:25.359 --> 04:20:26.309 align:start position:0%
the carbon offset tax credit economy if
you

04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
will because many other states are way
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
behind and they're looking to New
 
04:20:32.790 --> 04:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to come up with Solutions on
 
04:20:36.189 --> 04:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
this topic Governor aot is very involved
 
04:20:39.109 --> 04:20:39.119 align:start position:0%
in this topic she's she made mention in
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
her inaugural speech that she's
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about the Connecticut
 
04:20:44.550 --> 04:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
headquarters and she wants to make sure
 
04:20:47.149 --> 04:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
we get the agreement right so that we
 
04:20:48.990 --> 04:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
don't wipe out the forest industry in
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
the North country by tying up the land
 
04:20:55.229 --> 04:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
so I I've got enough knowledge on this
 
04:20:57.670 --> 04:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
that could be dangerous um like all of
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
us we're learning as we're going along
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
with this particular new program in the
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we all want to
 
04:21:05.950 --> 04:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
have a great environment we're the most
 
04:21:07.469 --> 04:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
livable state in the country we have
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
these great natural resources the
 
04:21:12.269 --> 04:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
mountains the Lakes the oceans but the
 
04:21:14.950 --> 04:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
way to really protect our state through
 
04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
this program is
 
04:21:19.870 --> 04:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
fairness and the whole purpose of the uh
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
Timber tax program in 1949 was for
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
conservation purposes and so I think if
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
we're able to create a yield tax for
 
04:21:29.279 --> 04:21:30.189 align:start position:0%
we're able to create a yield tax for
carbon

04:21:30.189 --> 04:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
04:21:33.710 --> 04:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
sequest uh sequestration uh registration
 
04:21:37.349 --> 04:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
that we will in turn be adding to that
 
04:21:39.229 --> 04:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
conservation Spirit here in New
 
04:21:41.550 --> 04:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so with that I'll take any
 
04:21:44.149 --> 04:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
questions Madam chairman
 
04:21:46.950 --> 04:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you councelor Kenny questions for
 
04:21:46.960 --> 04:21:48.469 align:start position:0%
thank you councelor Kenny questions for
the

04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
counselor seeing none thank you thank

04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.870 --> 04:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
government thank you very much um my
 
04:22:14.590 --> 04:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
name is Meredith Hatfield and I'm with
 
04:22:18.510 --> 04:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
the nature conservancy and we do oppose
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
um this legislation I have not had a
 
04:22:23.309 --> 04:22:23.319 align:start position:0%
chance to um fully consider the
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
amendment um so if our views change I
 
04:22:27.910 --> 04:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
will certainly follow up with additional
 
04:22:27.920 --> 04:22:30.349 align:start position:0%
will certainly follow up with additional
written

04:22:30.349 --> 04:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:34.109 --> 04:22:34.119 align:start position:0%
testimony we deeply appreciate um the
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
challenges of our some of our Northern
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
and rural areas of the state and we
 
04:22:40.550 --> 04:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
certainly want to be part of a
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
conversation to make sure that those
 
04:22:45.550 --> 04:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
towns are kept whole um we work with
 
04:22:47.469 --> 04:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
another organization the American Forest
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
foundation in support of a program for
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
those mom and pop owners as someone um
 
04:22:55.950 --> 04:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
called them so this is a program for
 
04:22:59.710 --> 04:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
small Forest owners of 30 acres and up
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
um and it's a 20year program and it's
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
really focused on
 
04:23:08.349 --> 04:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
helping those small land owners do
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
better Forest management
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
practices um so I want wanted to just
 
04:23:15.109 --> 04:23:15.119 align:start position:0%
share that information with you I I do
 
04:23:16.910 --> 04:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
have hot links in my letter so I will
 
04:23:18.269 --> 04:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
email it to you so that you can take a
 
04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
look at that program um last year there
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
have been a few references to the fact
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
that there was legislation last year
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
there were three bills um that sought to
 
04:23:30.910 --> 04:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
restrict control or tax um car Forest
 
04:23:33.269 --> 04:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
carbon programs and one bill survived
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
and as has been mentioned that has
 
04:23:36.910 --> 04:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
created a public registry that's
 
04:23:39.469 --> 04:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
available on the dncr website um I think
 
04:23:41.790 --> 04:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
there are seven properties as of last
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
month that were
 
04:23:45.630 --> 04:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
enrolled um that legislation that was
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1697 of last year that also
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
required the Department of Revenue
 
04:23:54.109 --> 04:23:54.119 align:start position:0%
Administration to conduct two studies on
 
04:23:57.750 --> 04:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
the tax impacts of um properties being
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
enrolled in programs they issued their
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
first report in
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
November um but said basically you not
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's a nice um overview of the issues
 
04:24:09.389 --> 04:24:09.399 align:start position:0%
but they said probably not not enough
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
time has gone by for them to assess the
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
impact between you know when the
 
04:24:15.429 --> 04:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
registry was created and when the bill
 
04:24:18.429 --> 04:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
passed they do have another report due
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
under that bill um on November 1 of this
 
04:24:22.990 --> 04:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
year which might provide more
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
information about the impact um so we
 
04:24:28.109 --> 04:24:28.119 align:start position:0%
would urge you that if you do want to
 
04:24:30.990 --> 04:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
move forward to maybe um hold on to this
 
04:24:34.510 --> 04:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh look at that Dr report um as
 
04:24:36.269 --> 04:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
several folks have already testified
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
this is a brand new issue there's a lot
 
04:24:40.830 --> 04:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
to learn about it um and it might make
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
sense to pause and and take a look at
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
what the state might do to address um
 
04:24:46.640 --> 04:24:47.550 align:start position:0%
what the state might do to address um
the

04:24:47.550 --> 04:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:47.560 --> 04:24:49.309 align:start position:0%
the
impacts

04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
04:24:53.469 --> 04:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
um as I said I I will provide additional
 
04:24:55.630 --> 04:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
uh information once I take a look at the
 
04:24:58.349 --> 04:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
um the amendment if it changes our view
 
04:25:00.670 --> 04:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:06.309 --> 04:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
you next the chair recognizes attorney n
 
04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
Grace followed by Mr Charles
 
04:25:18.109 --> 04:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
LC thank you madam chair n Grace for the
 
04:25:19.630 --> 04:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association the
 
04:25:22.109 --> 04:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce um I'm
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
here really on the amendment uh
 
04:25:26.239 --> 04:25:28.269 align:start position:0%
here really on the amendment uh
20252

04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
20252
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
97h um just briefly the Bia uh opposes
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
new taxes on businesses we would
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
consider this amendment to be imposing a
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
new tax on businesses because there's no
 
04:25:42.349 --> 04:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
existing tax on carbon credits there is
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
an existing um tax on stumpage um there
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
is a that's under uh 79 colon 3 there's
 
04:25:54.189 --> 04:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
a standing Timber tax under 79 colon 5
 
04:25:55.750 --> 04:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what the initial bill
 
04:25:58.910 --> 04:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
proposed to amend um but what this would
 
04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
do uh this amendment specifically would
 
04:26:07.149 --> 04:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
do is add this new uh carbon credit tax
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
and one thing I would like to point out
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
to the committee is on page two of the
 
04:26:14.429 --> 04:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
amendment lines 7-10 that's section uh
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
Roman 8 um it says that uh all other
 
04:26:22.590 --> 04:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA 79 are applicable to
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
the owner of the property so presumably
 
04:26:27.670 --> 04:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
that owner is still subject to
 
04:26:30.510 --> 04:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
importantly the standing Timber tax uh
 
04:26:32.550 --> 04:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
which is what uh has been claimed as
 
04:26:35.229 --> 04:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
being replaced here um but that
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment does not amend um that section
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the law as far as I am aware uh the
 
04:26:44.349 --> 04:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
other point that I want to make is that
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
um these carbon contracts are very
 
04:26:48.750 --> 04:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
complicated I attempted to understand
 
04:26:50.830 --> 04:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
how exactly they work over the past
 
04:26:54.269 --> 04:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
couple days and I am not that smart I
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
guess um because it really depends on
 
04:27:00.030 --> 04:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
exactly how these are set up and there's
 
04:27:02.149 --> 04:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
kind of there's a pretty wide variety of
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
options here
 
04:27:07.990 --> 04:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
um you know you have ones that go from a
 
04:27:10.229 --> 04:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
straight contract where you have you
 
04:27:11.870 --> 04:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
know somebody come out assess the force
 
04:27:14.590 --> 04:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
say 's this much you know Carbon credit
 
04:27:16.429 --> 04:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
you'll get and there's a payment out
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
that year there are ones that have
 
04:27:20.389 --> 04:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
periodic assessments attached to it so
 
04:27:22.590 --> 04:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
after a period of time is there growth
 
04:27:24.309 --> 04:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
or is there some sort of detriment like
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
there was an insect infestation or or a
 
04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
forest fire or timbering that occurred
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh and there's different calculations
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
for how to account for those um there
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
are other ones that you see a payout uh
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
after the assessment over a period of
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
years subject to some
 
04:27:45.510 --> 04:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh some differing
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
calculations um so in terms of exactly
 
04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
how this um this uh it's not as straight
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
as basically you're going to make a
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
certain amount of profit and we're going
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
to take 10% of that because there's a
 
04:28:03.389 --> 04:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
lot that's going to um be controlled by
 
04:28:05.550 --> 04:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
the exact wording of of these contracts
 
04:28:07.790 --> 04:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
and how that functions I'm certainly
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but that's
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
just something I wanted to flag for the
 
04:28:13.070 --> 04:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration
 
04:28:14.710 --> 04:28:14.720 align:start position:0%

any
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:28:20.630 --> 04:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%

Charles L followed by Mr Jason
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
stock welcome to Municipal and County
 
04:28:31.710 --> 04:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
government good afternoon thank you
 
04:28:33.870 --> 04:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee uh
 
04:28:37.030 --> 04:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
I'm Charlie LC am a license Forester New
 
04:28:38.750 --> 04:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and have a consulting company
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
Innovative natural resource Solutions a
 
04:28:42.870 --> 04:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
30-year-old company
 
04:28:47.229 --> 04:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
um I've been Associated uh with uh
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
carbon and Forest carbon and Forest
 
04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
carbon offset markets for many years so
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
i' probably considered at least somewhat
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
of an expert uh on the topic and I
 
04:28:58.830 --> 04:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
certainly can answer uh questions that
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
you might have uh on that uh I'm here in
 
04:29:04.109 --> 04:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
support of this legislation and the
 
04:29:07.510 --> 04:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and the reason is that I
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
frankly have not found a different way
 
04:29:12.550 --> 04:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with the issue before us which
 
04:29:15.750 --> 04:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
is the loss of Timber tax revenue as a
 
04:29:18.670 --> 04:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
result of the sale of forest carbon
 
04:29:21.070 --> 04:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
offset credits if there was another
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
solution I'd be advocating for but I
 
04:29:25.870 --> 04:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
think we've got to go down this path if
 
04:29:29.790 --> 04:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
you are concerned as I am that um loss
 
04:29:32.349 --> 04:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
of Revenue that otherwise would be going
 
04:29:35.590 --> 04:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
to towns and cities from Timber tax uh
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
is going to occur as Forest carbon sales
 
04:29:43.590 --> 04:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh happen so um with with that uh I
 
04:29:47.229 --> 04:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
simply want to uh say that this whole
 
04:29:49.070 --> 04:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
issue comes about as other speakers have
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
said as a result of what's happened on
 
04:29:52.990 --> 04:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
property uh that is in Coos County uh
 
04:29:59.070 --> 04:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the legislatively um
 
04:30:02.070 --> 04:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
derived uh committee citizens committee
 
04:30:03.950 --> 04:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
to the Connecticut lak and so I'm in
 
04:30:06.389 --> 04:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
imately uh familiar with what's gone on
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
up there and the loss of harvesting
 
04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's occurred um lastly uh I want to
 
04:30:14.830 --> 04:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
say that if you pass this legislation I
 
04:30:17.950 --> 04:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
hope you do um there is a real need to
 
04:30:20.830 --> 04:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
add an explicit requirement that
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
04:30:24.269 --> 04:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
develop administrative rules to
 
04:30:26.229 --> 04:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
implement this because this cannot be
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
implemented with just the statute the uh
 
04:30:32.590 --> 04:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
Dr has uh authority to draft
 
04:30:35.229 --> 04:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
administrative rules for this section of
 
04:30:38.349 --> 04:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
the statute but if if they choose to
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
delay um on this or not do it at all
 
04:30:43.309 --> 04:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
which they occasionally do because
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
they're so busy and that goes for All
 
04:30:46.830 --> 04:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
State agencies this won't get
 
04:30:48.670 --> 04:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
implemented so i' i' encourage you to
 
04:30:51.070 --> 04:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
add that to the bill to require them to
 
04:30:53.710 --> 04:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
Devi to to devise uh administrative
 
04:30:57.469 --> 04:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
rules um and lastly has been talk about
 
04:31:01.469 --> 04:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
carbon program and so you may have uh
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
heard because a few speakers have talked
 
04:31:05.469 --> 04:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
uh about different prrams so there are
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
many different Forest carbon offset
 
04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
programs there's not just one um and
 
04:31:14.830 --> 04:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
they actually cover different time
 
04:31:17.910 --> 04:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
frames the most common one uh is not
 
04:31:20.109 --> 04:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
associated with the California law on
 
04:31:22.990 --> 04:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
the California air resources board and
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
it is the general uh uh Market that
 
04:31:29.429 --> 04:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
occurs called the voluntary market and
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
that market is essentially
 
04:31:35.070 --> 04:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
non-governmental it's worldwide and it's
 
04:31:39.149 --> 04:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
really any entity that chooses to uh
 
04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
offset their greenhouse gas emissions by
 
04:31:44.910 --> 04:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing carbon offsets and carbon
 
04:31:47.469 --> 04:31:47.479 align:start position:0%
offsets is the broad category Forest
 
04:31:49.469 --> 04:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
carbon offsets are a subset of that
 
04:31:51.550 --> 04:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
because there're other carbon offset
 
04:31:53.469 --> 04:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
credits that get generated that are not
 
04:31:55.469 --> 04:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
from forest although Forest are the
 
04:31:58.189 --> 04:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
dominant ones and so the voluntary
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
Market is generally a 40-year market the
 
04:32:03.109 --> 04:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
one that the Connecticut Lakes property
 
04:32:05.550 --> 04:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
is in is the California Market which is
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
called the compliance market and it's
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
the only governmental related program
 
04:32:13.510 --> 04:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's available in the Northeast uh in
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
the US that is a 100-year market um the
 
04:32:19.910 --> 04:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
market that uh Miss Hatfield uh
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
described uh which is the family forest
 
04:32:25.469 --> 04:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
carbon program for family forest owners
 
04:32:27.870 --> 04:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
is 20 years but it's really in the
 
04:32:30.389 --> 04:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
40-year market because they aggregate
 
04:32:33.550 --> 04:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
many small land owners together and sell
 
04:32:37.070 --> 04:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
them uh for that 40-year uh duration so
 
04:32:39.109 --> 04:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
there's really the 40-year voluntary
 
04:32:41.309 --> 04:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
market and the 100-year compliance
 
04:32:43.790 --> 04:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
Market which is California and I'll end
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
there and I'd be glad to answer any
 
04:32:48.510 --> 04:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh on uh on carbon
 
04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
sequestration markets and so forth and I
 
04:32:53.229 --> 04:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
did last year do a PowerPoint
 
04:32:55.149 --> 04:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
presentation for another uh house
 
04:32:57.149 --> 04:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
committee I'd be glad to do that for you
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you chose to to become more schooled
 
04:33:01.229 --> 04:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
in this topic it's very complicated
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr LC
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
speaker representative grund thank you
 
04:33:11.470 --> 04:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:33:11.480 --> 04:33:12.429 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
question

04:33:12.429 --> 04:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
so my question before and maybe you're
 
04:33:16.429 --> 04:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
the perfect person to answer this so the
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
let's say the smaller land owner sells
 
04:33:22.349 --> 04:33:22.359 align:start position:0%
or enters into a carbon contract so
 
04:33:24.429 --> 04:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to get income I'm assuming
 
04:33:26.750 --> 04:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
from a company who wants to purchase the
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
carbon credits from them right usually
 
04:33:31.390 --> 04:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
through an intermediary they don't they
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
don't contract directly with that
 
04:33:34.830 --> 04:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
company and that's where the the
 
04:33:36.910 --> 04:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
programs come into play so the small B
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
but the small land owner will end up
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
with income on selling those credit
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
yes and no the family forest carbon
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
program that Miss Hatfield described uh
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
Works differently okay it actually pays
 
04:33:53.349 --> 04:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
you to do certain Forest practices or
 
04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
not do certain things like not cut
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
timber okay and it ends up owning your
 
04:34:00.070 --> 04:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
carbon but it PID you pays you a flat
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
fee that's why I say there are many
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
programs out there that's the only one
 
04:34:06.150 --> 04:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
that does it like that so generally I
 
04:34:08.470 --> 04:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
think what you're suggesting is true but
 
04:34:10.349 --> 04:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
in the case of that program for small
 
04:34:12.269 --> 04:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
land owners it's not exact actly they're
 
04:34:13.709 --> 04:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
not exactly getting paid for their
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
carbon sales okay yeah because I was
 
04:34:16.310 --> 04:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
trying to understand if they're going to
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
end up with income and they're going to
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
pay tax on that income but then each
 
04:34:22.670 --> 04:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
year they're going to pay 10% tax but
 
04:34:25.629 --> 04:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
that occurs now for Timber so understand
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
saying they're going to get double taxed
 
04:34:28.590 --> 04:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
because they've got income coming in but
 
04:34:30.750 --> 04:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
they're also going to get hit with a 10%
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
tax that's what I'm trying to understand
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
right it's a good question thanks for
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
the question um So currently when you
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
harvest Timber and there are creative
 
04:34:41.709 --> 04:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
ways and there are actual Federal St
 
04:34:45.429 --> 04:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
statutes around timber in taxation and
 
04:34:46.830 --> 04:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a good accountant they'll
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
know how to deal with it but the reality
 
04:34:51.551 --> 04:34:51.561 align:start position:0%
is you are paying uh on that income from
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
Timber already so this is no different
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
from that this is not a new tax as I've
 
04:34:58.590 --> 04:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
heard people describe it's really an
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
alternative tax to address the same
 
04:35:02.390 --> 04:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
issue if you choose not to harvest
 
04:35:04.750 --> 04:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
Timber but in the case of Timber you pay
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
an income tax at the federal level and
 
04:35:10.709 --> 04:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
then you still pay the yield tax uh in
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that Revenue goes of
 
04:35:14.830 --> 04:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
course to municipalities not to the
 
04:35:17.150 --> 04:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
state so this is no different from that
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
if you sell carbon you again you got to
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
declare the income but you you you
 
04:35:25.551 --> 04:35:25.561 align:start position:0%
theoretically need to pay on that income
 
04:35:27.949 --> 04:35:27.959 align:start position:0%
on the federal level and then this would
 
04:35:30.670 --> 04:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
do just as a Timber yield tax does and
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
charge uh in lie of essentially uh the
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
timber tax at the local level so that's
 
04:35:37.269 --> 04:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
why I don't think it's a new tax it's
 
04:35:38.910 --> 04:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
just a
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
rebranding further questions
 
04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
have a quick one um with regards to the
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
CSP registry I I heard
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
um it referenced that there we there are
 
04:35:54.029 --> 04:35:54.039 align:start position:0%
10 registrants right now seven I just
 
04:35:56.910 --> 04:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
looked it up and and Patrick Hackley the
 
04:35:58.949 --> 04:35:58.959 align:start position:0%
director of uh of division of force and
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
lands is here and his agency is the one
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
that created that as a result of Statute
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
but there are seven right now and I
 
04:36:07.590 --> 04:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
think there's just over 180,000 acres in
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
the registry so far he and I were
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
speaking earlier and these small land
 
04:36:14.230 --> 04:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
owners that we've been talking about
 
04:36:16.349 --> 04:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
most of this is and the Seven that are
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the registry are only the large land
 
04:36:19.709 --> 04:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
owns we're talking thousands of acres
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
and up and up meaning the Connecticut
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
Lakes property which is 100 well they
 
04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
have 141,000 Acres uh entered into it
 
04:36:29.709 --> 04:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
and so seven are in there now none of
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
the small family Forester owners are in
 
04:36:33.629 --> 04:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
it yet okay so my my question
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
irrespective of the number was do we do
 
04:36:39.189 --> 04:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
we know what type of uh I guess you
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
referred to it as a 100-year or 4 year
 
04:36:45.310 --> 04:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
Market do we know what type of carbon
 
04:36:49.150 --> 04:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
sequestration programs those acres are
 
04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
under we do the registry does does
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
require that right director heckley yes
 
04:36:56.551 --> 04:36:56.561 align:start position:0%
thank you it's in
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
there further questions seeing none
 
04:37:01.830 --> 04:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
04:37:04.910 --> 04:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
you at this time the chair recognizes Mr
 
04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
Jason stock followed by Mr Brody Dees
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
welcome to Municipal and County
 
04:37:09.840 --> 04:37:12.269 align:start position:0%
welcome to Municipal and County

nice wide chair thank you well good
 
04:37:17.869 --> 04:37:17.879 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh for the record I'm Jason
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
stock I'm the executive director of the
 
04:37:21.390 --> 04:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
04:37:23.910 --> 04:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
Association oh I do have WR some written
 
04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:42.029 --> 04:37:42.039 align:start position:0%
to so coming around is a
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
a discussion or position paper the the
 
04:37:45.789 --> 04:37:45.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Timberland
 
04:37:48.670 --> 04:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
Owners Association developed on the
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
subject of forest
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
carbon as an association we have members
 
04:37:56.590 --> 04:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
all over the place on this one we have
 
04:37:58.990 --> 04:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
land owners that say wow if someone's
 
04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
going to pay me not to harvest Timber
 
04:38:05.310 --> 04:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with that I it's a property
 
04:38:07.390 --> 04:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
right that carpon a property right if
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
someone wants to pay me for that that
 
04:38:13.949 --> 04:38:13.959 align:start position:0%
right what's wrong with that I also have
 
04:38:17.230 --> 04:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
members or nhtoa also has members of
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
Sawmills and wood consuming companies
 
04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
that say well wait a minute if you're
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
getting paid not to cut wood then how is
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
that going to affect my ability to
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
operate my
 
04:38:31.670 --> 04:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
Sawmill my my paper mill my logging
 
04:38:34.990 --> 04:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
business so we have we have members on
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
all over the place on this we spent a
 
04:38:40.949 --> 04:38:40.959 align:start position:0%
lot of time developing a position paper
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
to try imbalance land owners rights with
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
some of these what I'll call Rural
 
04:38:46.799 --> 04:38:48.189 align:start position:0%
some of these what I'll call Rural
economic

04:38:48.189 --> 04:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
economic
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
issues and and so what you have is is
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
the product of that I will say that is
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
always a like any other document it is a
 
04:39:00.269 --> 04:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
work in progress but that is coming
 
04:39:04.269 --> 04:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
around and what I would like to say is
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
carbon this is a carbon these carbon
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
programs are a new animal a new animal
 
04:39:12.269 --> 04:39:12.279 align:start position:0%
for us we're trying to there's new
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
territory for us we had a committee
 
04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
meeting policy committee meeting last
 
04:39:18.910 --> 04:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
week and the comment was made that 20
 
04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
years ago this wasn't even on the radar
 
04:39:22.670 --> 04:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
who would have thought someone would pay
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
me not to harvest Timber um there's also
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
questions about is this a property is
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
this real real property you're kind of
 
04:39:34.349 --> 04:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
placing a covenant on the property or
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
you're agreeing to do something in
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
exchange for for revenue is this is this
 
04:39:41.470 --> 04:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
real property is this some type of a
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
real estate transaction it's a property
 
04:39:48.070 --> 04:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
right um is there how does that apply um
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
as we all know there's a a real estate
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
transfer tax there's other taxes related
 
04:39:55.788 --> 04:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
to real estate how does that apply the
 
04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
one thing that in in Mr L and some of
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
the prior speakers touched on is these
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
this is a new issue this is a these are
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
new programs and we're plowing ground
 
04:40:09.470 --> 04:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's never been plowed before many of
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
these agreements do not even get
 
04:40:13.868 --> 04:40:13.878 align:start position:0%
recorded at the registry of deeds in
 
04:40:16.350 --> 04:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
fact one of the recommendations we have
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
as an association is that for the sake
 
04:40:21.150 --> 04:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
of transparency that we would recommend
 
04:40:23.470 --> 04:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
that folks register this at the registry
 
04:40:26.430 --> 04:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
of deeds so that say subsequent owners
 
04:40:29.070 --> 04:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
but that's not always the case and for
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
good reasons sometimes the transactions
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
between an individual I may own a 100
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
acres or or 10 let's say 10,000 acres
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
and I may do a carbon deal on that on 10
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
10,000 acres worth of Timberland it may
 
04:40:45.550 --> 04:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
not be tied specifically to a a
 
04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
particular lot so this is you know there
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions and a lot of
 
04:40:52.990 --> 04:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of pieces that we're looking at
 
04:40:54.990 --> 04:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
trying to Fig get our head around is we
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
look at this as Timberland owners and
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
also as a as a forest products Forest
 
04:40:59.878 --> 04:41:01.550 align:start position:0%
also as a as a forest products Forest
products

04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
products
 
04:41:05.550 --> 04:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
industry um we do recognize that if
 
04:41:07.470 --> 04:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
there's a reduction in Timber harvesting
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
as we've seen in in Conn on the
 
04:41:11.390 --> 04:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes property there's no
 
04:41:13.948 --> 04:41:13.958 align:start position:0%
question you have data there there is
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
there is a subsequent impact on the
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
forest products industry um we we do
 
04:41:21.948 --> 04:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
recognize that and for us the the two
 
04:41:24.030 --> 04:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
biggest issues that we're wrestling with
 
04:41:27.628 --> 04:41:27.638 align:start position:0%
is is that impact which really kind of
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
comes down to a fundamental property
 
04:41:31.190 --> 04:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
right whether I decide not to cut my
 
04:41:34.350 --> 04:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
wood because I'm in a carbon program or
 
04:41:36.430 --> 04:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
just because I want to grow big
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
trees who are we to say one's right one
 
04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
isn't but the question about local
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
revenues and this question of local
 
04:41:47.550 --> 04:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
Timber tax revenues is one that we've
 
04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
and I've had a lot of conversations with
 
04:41:51.868 --> 04:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill we've met with
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
him and and some of his colleagues and
 
04:41:56.788 --> 04:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
this is one that we do feel that there's
 
04:41:58.788 --> 04:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
there's some Merit in in digging into
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
that having said all of that the the
 
04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
um there were just too many questions
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
when we looked at that Amendment as an
 
04:42:18.628 --> 04:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
association and as a committee and mind
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
you my policy committee and some of you
 
04:42:22.670 --> 04:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
on this committee will appreciate this I
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
have five or six Selectmen there and
 
04:42:27.750 --> 04:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
select women that are looking at this
 
04:42:32.110 --> 04:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
saying all right how would I in my town
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
implement this you know so there was
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
some real kind of I'll say mechanical
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
questions that came into play that they
 
04:42:41.788 --> 04:42:41.798 align:start position:0%
looked at but we do agree and we are
 
04:42:45.670 --> 04:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the to this issue um you
 
04:42:47.708 --> 04:42:47.718 align:start position:0%
know an example is and you heard this
 
04:42:52.510 --> 04:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
from from Mr LC these contracts vary
 
04:42:56.110 --> 04:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
widely and it's not an annual it's not
 
04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
an annual payment that's made I don't
 
04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
sign up and then all of a sudden every
 
04:43:02.670 --> 04:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
year there's an annual payment that's
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
made sometimes I'll say that the
 
04:43:08.350 --> 04:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
payments are lumpy I may sign up a a a
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
piece of ground for a carbon program and
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
and they're purchasing the carbon that's
 
04:43:14.590 --> 04:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
out there on my
 
04:43:17.550 --> 04:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
landscape um I may get that payment in
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
installments over 5 years um then 10
 
04:43:24.750 --> 04:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
years later they do a there's a uh
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
survey or a um crws done on that
 
04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
property determine how much grew in that
 
04:43:33.390 --> 04:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
10 years time and that 10 years growth
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
at that point I may I may enter that or
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
or I'll say submit that for payment or I
 
04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
may cut it I may say guess what I've got
 
04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
some beautiful red oak out there the
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
Market's good it's worth more for me to
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
cut that red oak than it is to sell it
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
to the carbon folks let's I'm going to
 
04:43:54.910 --> 04:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
cut it I won't submit all of it or I
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
won't I'll only submit a portion of it
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
into the carbon program so again it's
 
04:44:02.430 --> 04:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
you know looking at this trying to
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
figure out okay it's
 
04:44:07.628 --> 04:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
not it's these can be lumpy it's
 
04:44:10.390 --> 04:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
contract by contract the other piece is
 
04:44:12.590 --> 04:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
when I cut it tree there's physical
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
evidence something was there there was a
 
04:44:17.470 --> 04:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
taxable event as my friends at Dr would
 
04:44:20.788 --> 04:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
say that tree was cut there's a stump
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
you can look at it you can calculate
 
04:44:25.470 --> 04:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
with some degree of proximity how many
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
board feet how many cords or tons and
 
04:44:31.628 --> 04:44:31.638 align:start position:0%
subsequently what species it is and then
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
subsequently what should you be paying
 
04:44:35.788 --> 04:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
as far as a Timber tax on it these
 
04:44:38.550 --> 04:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
carbon these are private transactions
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
most of them are not available for
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
public viewing and so you're trying to
 
04:44:44.830 --> 04:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
you're trying to understand or trying to
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
tax something that you may not have all
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
on again I I guess what I I will I will
 
04:44:57.310 --> 04:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
conclude with two points on that last
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
Point um you know the the last our last
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
comment on our our position paper is you
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
know make sure if we if we're going to
 
04:45:10.270 --> 04:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
if we're going to pass legislation to do
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
something let let's make sure it's
 
04:45:14.590 --> 04:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
enforcable and that it will accomplish
 
04:45:15.550 --> 04:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
what we
 
04:45:18.270 --> 04:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
want we would like to see these towns
 
04:45:20.910 --> 04:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
remain whole there's no question we've
 
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
our committee agreed to that our board
 
04:45:26.110 --> 04:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
everyone says yes we're not
 
04:45:30.030 --> 04:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
sure House Bill 123 or the subsequent
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment we're not convinced that does
 
04:45:34.670 --> 04:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
it we did commit and I've had
 
04:45:37.750 --> 04:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with the with the sponsor
 
04:45:40.030 --> 04:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
we were happy to work with him or any
 
04:45:42.788 --> 04:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
other committee to try to hammer out a
 
04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
process that does this we're not
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
convinced this is the process that does
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
this and we don't what we really don't
 
04:45:53.470 --> 04:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
want to do is then pass this and then
 
04:45:58.150 --> 04:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
tell Dr okay you guys figure it out
 
04:46:00.750 --> 04:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
develop some rules and let's you know
 
04:46:02.628 --> 04:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
develop some rules develop some forms
 
04:46:05.310 --> 04:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
and develop some processes and then you
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
you figure it out because I think at
 
04:46:10.510 --> 04:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
that point um again it's just another
 
04:46:10.520 --> 04:46:11.830 align:start position:0%
that point um again it's just another
varable

04:46:11.830 --> 04:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
varable
 
04:46:15.550 --> 04:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
able and the last thing I and I heard
 
04:46:18.590 --> 04:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
this comment is carbon is not
 
04:46:20.910 --> 04:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
incompatible with forestry and Timber
 
04:46:22.628 --> 04:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
harvesting there was a qu there's been
 
04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
some question about is it an all or
 
04:46:26.910 --> 04:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
nothing we have members that are in
 
04:46:29.670 --> 04:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
carbon programs and for their management
 
04:46:34.190 --> 04:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
it fits very well um I nhtoa has a
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
member it's a family ownership it's a
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
family ownership they've gone stem to
 
04:46:42.270 --> 04:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
stern kind of weeding and thinning this
 
04:46:44.830 --> 04:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
parcel they've hit a growth phase where
 
04:46:47.430 --> 04:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
they're saying all right for the next 30
 
04:46:49.230 --> 04:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
Years we're not going to harvest any
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
timber we've we've we've done the
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
weeding we have a nice stand of of trees
 
04:46:56.310 --> 04:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
that are going to turn into beautiful
 
04:47:00.510 --> 04:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
saw logs let them grow let them grow and
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
then the next 20 to you know 20 or 30
 
04:47:06.070 --> 04:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
years from now we'll Harvest them and in
 
04:47:07.868 --> 04:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
that instance that's a candidate they're
 
04:47:09.470 --> 04:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
they're looking at a carbon program
 
04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
saying all right in the interim here's
 
04:47:14.310 --> 04:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to get to get paid for
 
04:47:16.590 --> 04:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
that growth of that Timber the end of
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
that carbon program we can now move in
 
04:47:21.788 --> 04:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
and start harvesting that harvesting
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
that Timber and so again there there is
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
an opportunity here to use these a
 
04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
second example I'll leave with you and
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
this is more of a southern situation
 
04:47:33.150 --> 04:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
where you had a sawmill that wanted a
 
04:47:34.628 --> 04:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
certain diameter
 
04:47:37.628 --> 04:47:37.638 align:start position:0%
log the landowner it was a it was a real
 
04:47:40.390 --> 04:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
estate investment trust said well our
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
profarm phas tell us we can only grow
 
04:47:46.548 --> 04:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
I'll pick a number 18 in you want 22 in
 
04:47:48.510 --> 04:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
our profarma says our greatest rate of
 
04:47:52.510 --> 04:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
returns at 18 in and they they said well
 
04:47:56.110 --> 04:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
carbon markets why don't we enter these
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
these stands into a carbon Market we can
 
04:48:03.948 --> 04:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
get paid to grow that additional 4 in
 
04:48:06.750 --> 04:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
The Sawmill at the end of that carbon
 
04:48:10.190 --> 04:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
program Sawmill gets the the timber the
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
quality that they want the real estate
 
04:48:15.708 --> 04:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
investment trust their their proforma
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
Works they're happy and that's a
 
04:48:22.830 --> 04:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
situation where it actually does work so
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
I I think it's these these programs
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
there as varied and as unique as Timber
 
04:48:32.150 --> 04:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
and as the Timberland owners you have
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
Investment Trust you have families you
 
04:48:34.400 --> 04:48:35.230 align:start position:0%
Investment Trust you have families you
have

04:48:35.230 --> 04:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:48:38.590 --> 04:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
individuals and so again looking bring
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
to bring it all back to the bill we're
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
happy to work we're happy to work with
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
the sponsors or anyone else if there's a
 
04:48:48.030 --> 04:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee here or if if you hold the
 
04:48:50.590 --> 04:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
bill we're happy to work on them to try
 
04:48:52.548 --> 04:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
to accomplish what we believe is what
 
04:48:55.948 --> 04:48:55.958 align:start position:0%
they want to do and that's figure out
 
04:48:59.150 --> 04:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
that pole in that Municipal budget
 
04:49:02.270 --> 04:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's caused by carbon right now we
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is as you heard um
 
04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
from that Dr report and quite frankly
 
04:49:10.390 --> 04:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure when I look at the bill and
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
I look at at 10% of a carbon contract
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
well what is that how does that compare
 
04:49:18.750 --> 04:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
to veneer how does that compare to
 
04:49:21.868 --> 04:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
pulpwood or biomass chips what are we
 
04:49:24.070 --> 04:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
talking about that was the last piece
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
that my my committee said is what are
 
04:49:28.470 --> 04:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
the dollars what are the dollars and
 
04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
cents that we're looking at here we just
 
04:49:33.628 --> 04:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
don't know with that I will conclude my
 
04:49:35.470 --> 04:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm happy to try and answer
 
04:49:38.110 --> 04:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
any questions and I thank you for your
 
04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time this afternoon
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
you so the last pink card that I have is
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
Mr bro
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:59.110 --> 04:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
back thank you madam chairwoman and
 
04:50:00.270 --> 04:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee for letting
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
me speak today again my name is Brody
 
04:50:04.190 --> 04:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
Dees I represent the nire municipal
 
04:50:08.030 --> 04:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
Association and we are in support of the
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
bill as amended um
 
04:50:13.830 --> 04:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
we do have a copy of the amendment and
 
04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
first I do want to discuss the current
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill that you have in front of you um
 
04:50:22.430 --> 04:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 79 colon 5 tar knowledge with
 
04:50:24.110 --> 04:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
conversations I have with Dr and some of
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
our member municipalities has never been
 
04:50:30.070 --> 04:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
utilized um it's not possible to really
 
04:50:32.548 --> 04:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
utilize it because kind of the way the
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
statutes written you'll notice it says
 
04:50:37.948 --> 04:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
um that a town or city is unreasonably
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
deprived of of Revenue because of the
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
failure of an owner to cut standing wood
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
or Timber when it shall have arrived to
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
the degree of maturity most suitable for
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
its use and then you can see you know
 
04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
the amended language inserted in for
 
04:50:51.070 --> 04:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
carbon sequestration but then the
 
04:50:52.990 --> 04:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
existing statute says such standing W or
 
04:50:54.788 --> 04:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
Timber shall be taxed in the same manner
 
04:50:57.390 --> 04:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
as a general property which is
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
problematic of itself and subject to the
 
04:51:02.110 --> 04:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
same rights of appeal and then Etc um
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire doesn't tax general
 
04:51:06.190 --> 04:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
property anymore that went away a long
 
04:51:08.548 --> 04:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
time ago um we tax real property so
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
there is that distinction there because
 
04:51:13.110 --> 04:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
the statute it's very old um part of the
 
04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
point was you know when we allowed the
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
timber tax to be levied in the state
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
which I believe was by constitutional
 
04:51:21.910 --> 04:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment in 1941 or
 
04:51:24.350 --> 04:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
1942 um there were some communities that
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
were concerned that they would be
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
deprived revenues someone just chose to
 
04:51:29.708 --> 04:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
stop cutting wood that they would like
 
04:51:31.830 --> 04:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
revenues for literally the reason why
 
04:51:32.948 --> 04:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
we're here today there are people who
 
04:51:34.670 --> 04:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
are not cutting wood and it's depriving
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities of Revenue and it's you
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
know stagnating local economies in the
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
North Country um they kind of came came
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
up with this general tax credit where
 
04:51:44.430 --> 04:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
the municipality would still tax them as
 
04:51:46.110 --> 04:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
if they had cut the wood and they would
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
be able to keep track of that credit so
 
04:51:48.750 --> 04:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
then if they did cut the wood in the
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
future they would say oh we're going to
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
credit this much towards your Timber tax
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
because now you've cut it well there's
 
04:51:55.990 --> 04:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
issues with municipalities being able to
 
04:51:57.708 --> 04:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
keep track of credits and how that would
 
04:51:59.788 --> 04:51:59.798 align:start position:0%
be done it's not very explicitly stated
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
and it's also very hard to determine
 
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
what is unreasonably deprived
 
04:52:09.070 --> 04:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue there's really no way to define
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
that and municipalities that have have
 
04:52:13.070 --> 04:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
in the past said should we try to
 
04:52:14.750 --> 04:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
utilize this their legal council has
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
said no CU you're just going to end up
 
04:52:18.270 --> 04:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
in court trying to determine what is
 
04:52:21.430 --> 04:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
unreasonably deprived of Revenue and um
 
04:52:24.070 --> 04:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
and what is technically you know quote
 
04:52:26.910 --> 04:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
degree of maturity most suitable for use
 
04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
because different land owners have
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
different reasons why they're cutting
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
the wood at different points of the
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
trees's maturity and Municipal officials
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
would probably also have their own kind
 
04:52:39.788 --> 04:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
of way of determining that so trying to
 
04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
amend RSA 79 colon 5 to utilize you know
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
to try to capture this loss revenue for
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
carbon tax credits it's not workable and
 
04:52:48.510 --> 04:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
we really appreciate representative
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
Davis bringing forward an amendment to
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
tax carbon sequestration the same way
 
04:52:54.708 --> 04:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
that that Timber would be taxed if it
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
was cut all that's trying to happen is
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
these especially disproportionately
 
04:53:00.990 --> 04:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
rural North Country communities or even
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
some communities in Carol County you'll
 
04:53:03.708 --> 04:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
see if you look at the registry there's
 
04:53:05.310 --> 04:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of land in the town of Osby for
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
example that's being used for carbon
 
04:53:09.070 --> 04:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
sequestration we're trying to make sure
 
04:53:10.830 --> 04:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
they aren't deprived Revenue and trying
 
04:53:14.350 --> 04:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
to think of a fair in way to make sure
 
04:53:16.190 --> 04:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
these revenues can be raised and our
 
04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
opinion is 79 colon 3-c proposing the
 
04:53:22.150 --> 04:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is a fairway it kind of sets
 
04:53:23.548 --> 04:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
up the tax in the way that the existing
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
Timber Tax Works it has an objective um
 
04:53:27.830 --> 04:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the tonnage of carbon that's
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
for the capture I also want to go on the
 
04:53:33.150 --> 04:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
record and say that while the Bia and
 
04:53:34.750 --> 04:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
some of the business organizations have
 
04:53:36.990 --> 04:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
said that we have this existing 79 colon
 
04:53:38.750 --> 04:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
5 which has never been used and we
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recommend anyone try to use it
 
04:53:42.990 --> 04:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
we would be okay with repealing 79 colon
 
04:53:45.070 --> 04:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
5 in conjunction with adopting this
 
04:53:48.270 --> 04:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
amendment for the proposed 79 3-c that
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative Davis um has proposed so
 
04:53:53.430 --> 04:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
then there isn't any concern of double
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
taxation um doing both in conjunction we
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
think would help quell some of the
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
concerns of the quote double Taxation
 
04:54:01.628 --> 04:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
and also help municipalities especially
 
04:54:03.230 --> 04:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
those in the North Country who are being
 
04:54:05.548 --> 04:54:05.558 align:start position:0%
deprived these revenues because of very
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
complicated tax schemes that are being
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
cooked up in other states to incentivize
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
a car credit industry um which is
 
04:54:13.628 --> 04:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
currently right now having a negative
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
impact on the overall Timber industry
 
04:54:17.628 --> 04:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
and the revenues that municipalities are
 
04:54:19.750 --> 04:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
used to depending upon to help keep
 
04:54:22.830 --> 04:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
their property tax rates low and uh need
 
04:54:25.868 --> 04:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
to you know have to dip less into the
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
pockets of property taxpayers and with
 
04:54:30.270 --> 04:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
that I'll answer any questions thank you
 
04:54:34.868 --> 04:54:34.878 align:start position:0%

pleasure to be here uh for the record my
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
name is representative Bill M Hillsboro
 
04:57:03.670 --> 04:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
10 city of
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
Nashua I'm here to present the bill to
 
04:57:09.150 --> 04:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
allow a referendum on historic horse
 
04:57:11.670 --> 04:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
racing in cities and towns this is a
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
local issue Bill uh do you or do you
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
want to have a vote on whether to allow
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
casinos to develop in your local cities
 
04:57:20.040 --> 04:57:21.070 align:start position:0%
casinos to develop in your local cities
and

04:57:21.070 --> 04:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:24.628 --> 04:57:24.638 align:start position:0%
towns so the background of this is uh
 
04:57:26.590 --> 04:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
about 3 four years ago there was a bill
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
passed to allow historic horse racing
 
04:57:32.430 --> 04:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
and these are basically slot machines
 
04:57:36.190 --> 04:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
that uh are very attractive to play and
 
04:57:37.708 --> 04:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
the terms and conditions for these slot
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
machines were quite attractive to The
 
04:57:39.240 --> 04:57:40.708 align:start position:0%
machines were quite attractive to The
Operators

04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
Operators
 
04:57:42.110 --> 04:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
for example if you wanted to open a
 
04:57:43.548 --> 04:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
casino in
 
04:57:46.628 --> 04:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you'd be paying between 25
 
04:57:50.230 --> 04:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
and $85 million for a license to operate
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
a property with a th000 slot
 
04:57:55.708 --> 04:57:55.718 align:start position:0%
machines if you want to operate a
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
property with a th000 slot machines in
 
04:57:57.480 --> 04:57:58.310 align:start position:0%
property with a th000 slot machines in
New

04:57:58.310 --> 04:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire your license fee is
 
04:58:04.350 --> 04:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
$250 so we've offered quite attractive
 
04:58:08.230 --> 04:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
conditions to uh expand Casino gaming uh
 
04:58:10.230 --> 04:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the past when we've looked at
 
04:58:14.150 --> 04:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
expanding gaming we've had a casino bill
 
04:58:15.708 --> 04:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
that looked at
 
04:58:18.310 --> 04:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
various uh impact on cities and towns
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
such as do we want to have a referendum
 
04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
to opt in uh what terms do we want to
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
have for mitigation to the cities and
 
04:58:26.830 --> 04:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
towns uh do we have want to have an opt
 
04:58:26.840 --> 04:58:27.948 align:start position:0%
towns uh do we have want to have an opt
out

04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
provision um how should the money go
 
04:58:32.548 --> 04:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
well much of that's not been really
 
04:58:35.350 --> 04:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
thought out with the bill that allowed
 
04:58:38.590 --> 04:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
historic racing in New Hampshire so the
 
04:58:40.470 --> 04:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
current situation we have and speak to
 
04:58:43.390 --> 04:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
my city of Nashua is that we had a mom
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
and pop uh chable gaming establishment
 
04:58:49.030 --> 04:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
lucky moose is one
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
example uh Bar and Grill uh some C
 
04:58:56.708 --> 04:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
tables and uh now they were allowed to
 
04:58:59.990 --> 04:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
expand it to Historic horse
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
racing so what happens is that the
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
business now gets sold to an out ofate
 
04:59:09.430 --> 04:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
operator uh in this case ecl
 
04:59:09.440 --> 04:59:11.390 align:start position:0%
operator uh in this case ecl
entertainment

04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
entertainment
 
04:59:14.190 --> 04:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
and they uh buy the vacant property in
 
04:59:16.470 --> 04:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
our Prime retail District the Sears
 
04:59:18.430 --> 04:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
store right at the
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
border and now they're in the process of
 
04:59:22.150 --> 04:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
opening up
 
04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
a major Casino two floors 180,000 square
 
04:59:30.270 --> 04:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
feet over 100 over a thousand slot
 
04:59:34.590 --> 04:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
machines and I talked to my folks here
 
04:59:35.948 --> 04:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
in asille and they said well you know
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is coming and they said
 
04:59:41.310 --> 04:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
what uh well how did this happen I said
 
04:59:43.788 --> 04:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
well we passed a bill that allowed the
 
04:59:46.110 --> 04:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
equivalent of slot machines and we did
 
04:59:49.548 --> 04:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
not put any optin on this situation so
 
04:59:53.150 --> 04:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's allowed and the opportunity was
 
04:59:55.150 --> 04:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
taken by the business people and now the
 
04:59:56.948 --> 04:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
sear store is going to be a major casino
 
04:59:58.270 --> 04:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
right on our
 
04:59:58.280 --> 05:00:00.628 align:start position:0%
right on our
border

05:00:00.628 --> 05:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
border
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
okay so one of the objections I had was
 
05:00:07.390 --> 05:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
my prior experience in Ways and Means
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
which is whenever we would expand
 
05:00:12.868 --> 05:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
gambling we always had an optin
 
05:00:15.548 --> 05:00:15.558 align:start position:0%
provision I worked on the casino on The
 
05:00:18.390 --> 05:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
Kino bill which I've passed out a copy
 
05:00:21.590 --> 05:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
of for your reference and said well you
 
05:00:24.270 --> 05:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
can have Kino we the state will allow it
 
05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
but if you want Kino then you should opt
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
in for it and NASA passed on the first
 
05:00:32.230 --> 05:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
Go Round And opted in on second go round
 
05:00:34.548 --> 05:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
some cities have most cities and towns
 
05:00:36.548 --> 05:00:36.558 align:start position:0%
have but we wanted to give local control
 
05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
to expanded gambling well we had a
 
05:00:41.390 --> 05:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
loophole in this
 
05:00:43.150 --> 05:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
uh historic horse racing law that did
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
not have this
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
optin so uh my bill is to ask the
 
05:00:51.548 --> 05:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
question of should we now have an optin
 
05:00:55.590 --> 05:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
for any future historic horse racing
 
05:00:58.510 --> 05:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
establishments uh right now there's 14
 
05:01:01.310 --> 05:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
charal gaming establishments that are
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to have historic racing
 
05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
licenses and our recent experience is
 
05:01:09.750 --> 05:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
that these won't just stay as as who
 
05:01:11.868 --> 05:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
they they are they'll be sold out most
 
05:01:14.190 --> 05:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
likely to a large operator who build a
 
05:01:14.200 --> 05:01:15.110 align:start position:0%
likely to a large operator who build a
major

05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
major
 
05:01:17.670 --> 05:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
Casino which is allowed in your city or
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
town you don't have that provision to
 
05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
say we don't want
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
it so I propose that we should have that
 
05:01:27.750 --> 05:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
Authority that the people in the cities
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
and towns should be able to say yes or
 
05:01:34.628 --> 05:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
no if we want to have a major
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
Casino uh evolve from the small historic
 
05:01:41.670 --> 05:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
gaming property that we've had
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
so the bill takes the language of The
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
Kino Bill and adds a couple of
 
05:01:49.868 --> 05:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
paragraphs which basically grandfathers
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
the properties that already have the
 
05:01:53.470 --> 05:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing
 
05:01:56.708 --> 05:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
machines until such time as the year
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
ends then anything after January 1st of
 
05:02:05.190 --> 05:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
2026 any additional properties that want
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
to have historic racing in your city and
 
05:02:11.230 --> 05:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
town will have to go through the ref
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
process and with that I'll take
 
05:02:20.430 --> 05:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:23.948 --> 05:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:02:33.430 --> 05:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:33.440 --> 05:02:35.230 align:start position:0%
 
King

05:02:35.230 --> 05:02:35.240 align:start position:0%

05:02:37.990 --> 05:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay does the committee have any
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%

my name is Alicia Preston I represent
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire charitable gaming
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
operators Association we just have one
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
slight concern with this bill and that's
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
the eligibility point that represented M
 
05:03:13.150 --> 05:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh pointed out which is January 1st
 
05:03:15.510 --> 05:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
2026 right now while there are 14
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
licenses there are five who appli to the
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission current law states
 
05:03:21.390 --> 05:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
that those are that's the max that's a
 
05:03:23.310 --> 05:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
topout that anybody can have store
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
course racing in New Hampshire until
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
January of 2031 that's current law and
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure those five
 
05:03:31.990 --> 05:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
those of whom get approved are protected
 
05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill as they've already done
 
05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of investment and
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
process in the state so if there could
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
just be a language tweak that says um
 
05:03:42.030 --> 05:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
entities licensed or
 
05:03:44.910 --> 05:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
eligible to param Mutual wages on storic
 
05:03:54.548 --> 05:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:54.558 --> 05:03:56.750 align:start position:0%
 
concern

05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:03:58.628 --> 05:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
questions could could you repeat what
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
you just said I was taking notes sure um
 
05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
on page one line 29 it says
 
05:04:06.310 --> 05:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the provisions of this
 
05:04:08.910 --> 05:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
section entities licensed to sell if it
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
said licensed or eligible to
 
05:04:15.548 --> 05:04:15.558 align:start position:0%
sell I think that would solve that and
 
05:04:18.110 --> 05:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
again on page two
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
line7 provided that licenses eligible by
 
05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
valid you said page two line s yes like
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
then you said provided that licenses
 
05:04:41.670 --> 05:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
eligible prior to J jary 1 2026 shall
 
05:04:41.680 --> 05:04:42.830 align:start position:0%
eligible prior to J jary 1 2026 shall
remain

05:04:42.830 --> 05:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
remain
 
05:04:45.030 --> 05:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
valid and again those are the only ones
 
05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
that can operate already in the state
 
05:04:46.400 --> 05:04:47.670 align:start position:0%
that can operate already in the state
until

05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%

bill that was signed in into law that
 
05:35:52.350 --> 05:35:52.360 align:start position:0%

uh probably five years of work on our
 
05:41:37.830 --> 05:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
master plan
 
05:41:40.948 --> 05:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
and adding these two chapters is
 
05:41:40.958 --> 05:41:42.990 align:start position:0%
and adding these two chapters is
entirely

05:41:42.990 --> 05:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
05:41:47.070 --> 05:41:47.080 align:start position:0%

production those have been covered or
 
05:41:56.190 --> 05:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
could be covered in any one of a number
 
05:42:00.150 --> 05:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
of places such as the land use
 
05:42:00.160 --> 05:42:02.270 align:start position:0%

chapter
 
05:42:06.590 --> 05:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
um resources Economic Development it it
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
could go almost anywhere the second
 
05:42:13.750 --> 05:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
suggested chapter is a catchall that
 
05:42:17.548 --> 05:42:17.558 align:start position:0%
says add anything else and that's just
 
05:42:18.510 --> 05:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:42:21.070 --> 05:42:21.080 align:start position:0%

representative Dolan would you like to
 
05:45:55.468 --> 05:45:55.478 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes this uh bill
 
05:46:00.190 --> 05:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
has a couple of rather vague uh elements
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
to it one is to uh that the that the uh
 
05:46:06.708 --> 05:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
me any measure at the town meeting has
 
05:46:09.468 --> 05:46:09.478 align:start position:0%
to to have at least 15% of registered
 
05:46:12.468 --> 05:46:12.478 align:start position:0%
voters and also a majority of those
 
05:46:16.948 --> 05:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
voting um it's unclear when 15 when do
 
05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
you strike the line for 15% of the
 
05:46:21.670 --> 05:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
voters some towns do it the the day
 
05:46:24.468 --> 05:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
prior to town meeting others do it at
 
05:46:27.548 --> 05:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
town meeting and majority of those same
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
thing the majority of those voting uh
 
05:46:33.190 --> 05:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's that's a vague uh and it
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
appears to be left up to the town
 
05:46:38.830 --> 05:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
moderator or some another uh individual
 
05:46:42.070 --> 05:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
to determine that so in in light of that
 
05:46:44.868 --> 05:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
it needs to be it until the the bill is
 
05:46:44.878 --> 05:46:46.788 align:start position:0%
it needs to be it until the the bill is
better

05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:46:48.788 --> 05:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
written thank you is there any
 
05:46:52.708 --> 05:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
discussion on this motion representative
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair um so I just
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
want to add that I I think the reason I
 
05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
do support the itl it's uh not just the
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
vagueness of the 15% but I do struggle
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
with the 15% because forcing people to
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
show up is one thing but we can't you
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
know like how do you force people to
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
show up I mean the people who do show up
 
05:47:14.948 --> 05:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
do so by
 
05:47:18.468 --> 05:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
choice and for the people who don't show
 
05:47:19.948 --> 05:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
up which would might be a majority
 
05:47:21.670 --> 05:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
you're now putting their will on the
 
05:47:23.190 --> 05:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
people who do show up so now you've
 
05:47:25.110 --> 05:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
suppressed their voice so I really do
 
05:47:28.350 --> 05:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
struggle with the
 
05:47:33.390 --> 05:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none then the motion
 
05:47:39.910 --> 05:47:39.920 align:start position:0%

05:50:57.270 --> 05:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
motion this just seems to be uh almost
 
05:51:00.590 --> 05:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
like you'd be giving money way back to
 
05:51:02.590 --> 05:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
the veterans if it goes over the amounts
 
05:51:06.830 --> 05:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the property tax therefore um it's
 
05:51:06.840 --> 05:51:10.948 align:start position:0%
of the property tax therefore um it's
really

05:51:10.948 --> 05:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:13.510 --> 05:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
unworkable is there any further comments
 
05:51:13.520 --> 05:51:16.230 align:start position:0%
unworkable is there any further comments
or

05:51:16.230 --> 05:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:19.350 --> 05:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Gerard thank
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair basically again I
 
05:51:23.670 --> 05:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
understand what the representative said
 
05:51:25.868 --> 05:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
but I think our bigger concerns is the
 
05:51:27.708 --> 05:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
fact that the VA housing standards are
 
05:51:30.990 --> 05:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
much stricter than the Ada guidelines um
 
05:51:33.670 --> 05:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
and no one can clearly Define what makes
 
05:51:36.030 --> 05:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
a house ADA Compliant as well so those
 
05:51:39.230 --> 05:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
are the reason why I agree with the
 
05:51:43.548 --> 05:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
itl further comments or
 
05:51:46.990 --> 05:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
discussion so I I have some
 
05:51:50.708 --> 05:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
comments so um we understand that the
 
05:51:53.628 --> 05:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to expand eligibility
 
05:51:58.310 --> 05:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
Criterion for RSA 72
 
05:52:02.230 --> 05:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
236a which is certain disabled veterans
 
05:52:06.510 --> 05:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
to exempt the full property um taxes um
 
05:52:07.510 --> 05:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
on their
 
05:52:10.948 --> 05:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
Homestead so um for those of you who
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
were here last year on this committee
 
05:52:16.910 --> 05:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
and for as a reminder or a refresher and
 
05:52:20.830 --> 05:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
for those who were not on this
 
05:52:25.750 --> 05:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee we had a bill 2024 House Bill
 
05:52:29.350 --> 05:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
1154 that came before the committee and
 
05:52:32.030 --> 05:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
I happen to have been the prime sponsor
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
of that bill so that was that bill was
 
05:52:38.230 --> 05:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
filed at the joint request of the Deputy
 
05:52:40.310 --> 05:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
adant general of the New Hampshire
 
05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
National Guard as and the director of
 
05:52:47.030 --> 05:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of military
 
05:52:50.190 --> 05:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services so they
 
05:52:52.548 --> 05:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
reached out to me and they
 
05:52:57.230 --> 05:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
um asked that this bill be filed for um
 
05:53:00.110 --> 05:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
this particular property tax exemption
 
05:53:03.628 --> 05:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
be because they had found that in its um
 
05:53:07.708 --> 05:53:07.718 align:start position:0%
application was extremely um
 
05:53:11.510 --> 05:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
confusing and what was happening is that
 
05:53:13.310 --> 05:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
in the mun
 
05:53:16.110 --> 05:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities the either the assessors
 
05:53:19.110 --> 05:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
or the select board uh
 
05:53:21.868 --> 05:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
Selectmen they were confused as to you
 
05:53:24.430 --> 05:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
know what was the eligibility Criterion
 
05:53:26.990 --> 05:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
and and additionally there were veterans
 
05:53:31.270 --> 05:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
that were um coming before these these
 
05:53:33.628 --> 05:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
parties and and they were saying well
 
05:53:35.990 --> 05:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
well they were believing that they were
 
05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
eligible for this property tax exe
 
05:53:43.070 --> 05:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
exemption and also the um New Hampshire
 
05:53:44.830 --> 05:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
05:53:44.840 --> 05:53:46.230 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
veteran

05:53:46.230 --> 05:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
veteran
 
05:53:48.830 --> 05:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
services as well as the VA in New
 
05:53:50.628 --> 05:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they were getting inquiries
 
05:53:53.310 --> 05:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
and you know people are very confused
 
05:53:56.070 --> 05:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
and people were upset and perhaps
 
05:53:58.750 --> 05:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
rightly so and so the issue at hand is
 
05:54:00.788 --> 05:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
that this particular certain disabled
 
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
veterans property tax exemption was
 
05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
being applied um differently across the
 
05:54:09.270 --> 05:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
state and and that's a
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:16.230 --> 05:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
um what was what was asked and what was
 
05:54:19.270 --> 05:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
done is that the language was was made
 
05:54:19.280 --> 05:54:20.190 align:start position:0%
done is that the language was was made
more

05:54:20.190 --> 05:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
clear um to uh State very very clearly
 
05:54:27.628 --> 05:54:27.638 align:start position:0%
and I I won't go through all the details
 
05:54:30.910 --> 05:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
but um it it
 
05:54:30.920 --> 05:54:33.150 align:start position:0%
but um it it
it

05:54:33.150 --> 05:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:54:38.468 --> 05:54:38.478 align:start position:0%
clarified that this tax exemption was um
 
05:54:42.510 --> 05:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
linked to the sah and sha
 
05:54:46.468 --> 05:54:46.478 align:start position:0%
grants the other thing um that I would
 
05:54:50.708 --> 05:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
note is that this bill here before us
 
05:54:52.590 --> 05:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
would essentially
 
05:54:55.548 --> 05:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
undo that legislation that was signed
 
05:54:59.590 --> 05:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
into law because it it goes in and it
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
expands um the
 
05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility with its Language by um
 
05:55:11.110 --> 05:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
including a veteran who and it's it
 
05:55:14.788 --> 05:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
talks about it adds on to the sah or SHA
 
05:55:18.910 --> 05:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
home um eligibility criteria and then it
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
adds or owns a home that is ADA
 
05:55:22.990 --> 05:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
Compliant and meets the needs of their
 
05:55:27.708 --> 05:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
disability which I would um concur with
 
05:55:30.150 --> 05:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative Gerard that that's very
 
05:55:32.190 --> 05:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
confused that's that's just so broad
 
05:55:35.468 --> 05:55:35.478 align:start position:0%
it's open and and furthermore there's no
 
05:55:40.150 --> 05:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
real way to establish you know what that
 
05:55:43.070 --> 05:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
is and what's the documentation so
 
05:55:47.468 --> 05:55:47.478 align:start position:0%
therefore to insert have this um amended
 
05:55:49.708 --> 05:55:49.718 align:start position:0%
into this current statute is just going
 
05:55:53.468 --> 05:55:53.478 align:start position:0%
back 10 steps and and also there's the
 
05:55:56.788 --> 05:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
second um addition or is modified
 
05:55:59.868 --> 05:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
through the VA hospital system well to
 
05:56:04.070 --> 05:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
be clear those were the issues that was
 
05:56:07.350 --> 05:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
also causing confusion because veterans
 
05:56:10.670 --> 05:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know would like for example um you
 
05:56:14.830 --> 05:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
know if I heard a story where a a
 
05:56:19.270 --> 05:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
veteran had received money to install a
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
walk-in um tub bathtub
 
05:56:28.190 --> 05:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:30.750 --> 05:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
disability but the problem what with
 
05:56:32.990 --> 05:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
regards to the legislation last year
 
05:56:35.230 --> 05:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
that that's not what the criteria is and
 
05:56:36.948 --> 05:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
it's just it's
 
05:56:38.910 --> 05:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
like I said we we would be going
 
05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
backwards um with this
 
05:56:44.910 --> 05:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
bill um and the last thing that that I
 
05:56:49.430 --> 05:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
will say is that um to be clear
 
05:56:52.830 --> 05:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
currently in in New Hampshire statutes
 
05:56:56.670 --> 05:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
we have seven a total of seven veterans
 
05:57:00.548 --> 05:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
tax credit credits and exemptions so we
 
05:57:02.590 --> 05:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
have the standard as well as the
 
05:57:05.110 --> 05:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
optional veterans tax credit and that's
 
05:57:06.990 --> 05:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
the standard is $50
 
05:57:12.190 --> 05:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
and the optional ranges from $51 to
 
05:57:14.948 --> 05:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
$750 and I understand that there's a
 
05:57:17.990 --> 05:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that that we may see that
 
05:57:21.468 --> 05:57:21.478 align:start position:0%
seeks to increase that upper Max to
 
05:57:24.030 --> 05:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
1,000 we have the all veterans tax
 
05:57:27.670 --> 05:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
credit um which is available we have the
 
05:57:30.230 --> 05:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
optional tax credit for combat service
 
05:57:33.270 --> 05:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's for service members having combat
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
service we have the surviving spouses we
 
05:57:39.190 --> 05:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
also have the veterans of Allied Forces
 
05:57:41.910 --> 05:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
for veterans of foreign military service
 
05:57:44.150 --> 05:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
we have tax credit for service connected
 
05:57:48.350 --> 05:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
total disability which is pnt at 4,000
 
05:57:52.150 --> 05:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
um and we recently passed a bill in the
 
05:57:54.868 --> 05:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
house um where we raised that to
 
05:57:58.230 --> 05:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and that was House Bill 99 and
 
05:58:01.468 --> 05:58:01.478 align:start position:0%
then lastly we have this um certain
 
05:58:01.478 --> 05:58:02.548 align:start position:0%
then lastly we have this um certain
disabled

05:58:02.548 --> 05:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
disabled
 
05:58:07.590 --> 05:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
veterans so um I feel that we we do take
 
05:58:12.590 --> 05:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
care of our veterans and um the final
 
05:58:15.110 --> 05:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
final comment would be that with any
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
type of a tax exemption or credit and
