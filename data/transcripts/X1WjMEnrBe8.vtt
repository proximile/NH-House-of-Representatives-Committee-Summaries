we do not have the pink cards for people
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
indicate they wish to testify but I it
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
was rummaging around in the other room
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
and I found pink you had a phone message
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
things and since they're pink I'm going
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
to declare their pink cards for the
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
purpose of this meeting so if you would
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
like to testify you can
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
um just put your name and a brief
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
description of your topic and fill it
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
out and pass it up if you would
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
okay while you were sleeping we had a
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
palace coup and the chairman of the
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee decided he wanted me to be
 
00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:58.700 align:start position:0%
chairman of this subcommittee and and
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
he's older than me so I agreed
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
um this is the subcommittee looking at
 
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
transparency in the reporting of
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
complaints against Physicians that's not
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
the technical term that's all I can
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
think of without going through my papers
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to start with is the
 
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
minutes from last time and
 
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.810 align:start position:0%
minutes from last time and
um

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you how I did it I wrote like
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
crazy and then wherever somebody gave a
 
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
crazy and then wherever somebody gave a
testimony

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:41.459 align:start position:0%
uh I sent them that section of my draft
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
not so that they could give additional
 
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
testimony but just correct errors and
 
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
omissions and I got things back from
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
various people so the second version of
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
the minutes
 
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.449 align:start position:0%
the minutes
um

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:55.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
we have you were sent them the end of
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
last week you should have hard copy in
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
front of you if you're on this
 
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I'd just like to give
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
you a few minutes to go through again we
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't uh update the minutes in the sense
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
that things have happened over the
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
weekend but we want to get as clear a
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
description of what was said as we can
 
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
so if you see errors or omissions
 
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.829 align:start position:0%
so if you see errors or omissions
um

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
this would be the time to bring them
 
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:32.930 align:start position:0%
this would be the time to bring them
forth

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%

distributed

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
you're taking the trains yeah
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:54.500 align:start position:0%
um yes representative
 
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
and I just had a question um no I'm
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to receive a second and then we
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
can have questions and discussion I'll
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
second it all right give a second now
 
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
your question uh there was a couple
 
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
statues mentioned in here I think should
 
00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
have been statutes I didn't know if you
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
wanted to change that at all on page if
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
we're referring to
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um 3D release of famous figures their
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
statues if their laws their statutes so
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh where in the on page three uh
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Weber asked Dr Conway
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
about a statue
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
we note that it was violated so we hope
 
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's a statute thank you and number six
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
on page number six on the um the statue
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
regarding bom is permissive says statute
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
I don't even want to change that
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
and where is this again Page Six
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
where uh third or fourth line down the
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
statue regarding important medicine
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
you do know at my one of my day jobs is
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
don't you I do not well we'll tell you
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
afterwards that's why my default is to
 
00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:02.110 align:start position:0%
afterwards that's why my default is to
Statue

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh first I I
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't know how you did it Mr chair uh
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
chairing the committee and taking notes
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
and producing them it's just incredible
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
I I think Oxford is proud of you uh and
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
I would just point out a small thing
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
that I think on the last page of written
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
material it says that division three of
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
Finance is responsible for Health and
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
Human Services matters I I would
 
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
substitute the word resources for
 
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.930 align:start position:0%
substitute the word resources for
matters

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:31.940 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
resources yes sir you you do matters I
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
do resources
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
counselor you have a correction yes
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um during our last
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
meeting during Dr Baker's testimony I
 
00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:57.430 align:start position:0%
meeting during Dr Baker's testimony I
would

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
happen to my mic I was taking notes
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
myself and I noted something very
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
important to me at least and I was
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could amend the minutes
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
to reflect the statement but during her
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
testimony Dr Baker uh was pointing out
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
that very few claims were actually
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
worthy of discipline and she made a I
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
believe page eight would be the most
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate section
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
oh she was she was this was while she
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
was disgusting um not having the tort
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
system driving evaluation of medical
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
practitioners and she made a comment
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
that discipline could create stigma for
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
doctors who have and I put in quotes
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
learned their lesson and to me the
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
statement is ambiguous and we didn't
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
follow up on it and I thought it was an
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
important enough statement to amend the
 
00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
minutes to add it
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
first of all tell me first of all please
 
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
tell me where on page eight you would
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
about halfway down there's a line that
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
says mention was made of the Federation
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
of State Medical boards fsmb okay uh
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
what do other state boards do how much
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
do we want to yield to legal system in
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
um the statement was made according to
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
my notes around the time of of those
 
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.889 align:start position:0%
my notes around the time of of those
questions

00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:17.899 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
and would you repeat slowly please I
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
actually wrote it down I can repeat it
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
but I also wrote it down when you wrote
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
it down when you now say it would you
 
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
again say it slowly please sure
 
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.470 align:start position:0%
again say it slowly please sure
discipline

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
so this is my own statement discipline
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
could create stigma for doctors who have
 
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:46.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
this is a tribute does anyone else
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
recall anything like that being said by
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
Dr Baker from the Board of Medicine I I
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
actually do recall the phrase I don't
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
understand what it's it's significant
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
you want it in there I'm just curious
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
what your interpretation of that is I
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
think the language the term learn their
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
lesson is ambiguous enough considering
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about transparency uh it
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
might be worth following up and maybe
 
00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
getting seeking clarification from Dr
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
Baker at some point as to what she meant
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
by and learned their lesson because we
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
it was in the context of not
 
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
as I recall that part of the
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
conversation she was dealing with an
 
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.810 align:start position:0%
conversation she was dealing with an
area

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:34.820 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
around you know maybe maybe the notes
 
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
weren't done on time or maybe the notes
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
were incomplete it sounded to me like as
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
I recall that she was dealing with more
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
of the administrative functioning of
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
being a doctor as opposed to the
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
clinical decision making is that the way
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.169 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
did you say that again I'm not quite
 
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
sure I understand oh okay so she was
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
going through the layers of reasons that
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine should get
 
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
involved and and there was a section of
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
what position Behavior may be that could
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
create some interest uh such as uh poor
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
note keeping or late note keeping you
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
know the documentation and the medical
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
record those sorts of administrative
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
aspects of being a good physician as
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to the quality of the medical or
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
clinical decisions being made and I
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
think the reason she said well they've
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
learned their lesson if they get
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
prompted to to to do more timely medical
 
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
records keeping than that could be
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
handled without it becoming a kind of a
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
public thing that could hurt their
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
reputation that that's the way I
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber please
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
I can shed some light on that too
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
because I think it was my question
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
because I was kind of appalled by the
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
statement that somebody could have
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
violated a statute
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
and not receive discipline and so I
 
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:16.460 align:start position:0%
think I asked the question
 
00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:18.620 align:start position:0%
what on Earth
 
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
give me an example of somebody who had
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
violated a statute yet would not receive
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
discipline that sounds like a pretty
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
bright line to me and the example she
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
gave was what you were talking about
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
somebody who did not keep their notes as
 
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
legibly as people would like and and her
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
point was you know that's something that
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
yes is is actually contrary to the
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
statute but a word to the wise is
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
probably going to suffice as opposed to
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
as you say a clinical
 
00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:52.460 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
needs far more discussion and and
 
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
all right yeah I remember something like
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
that because certainly there are minor
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
things and if we read up everybody who
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
made a mistake uh other than the ones
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
here uh would we wouldn't have anybody
 
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
doing anything anymore but there are
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
major things such as clinical errors
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
that are should be inexcusable
 
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.490 align:start position:0%
that are should be inexcusable
ah

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
so that's a good clarification
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
so it was moved to accept the minutes
 
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
but should we amend the motion to amend
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
the minutes uh given the updates that
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
I think I think representative Solway
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
needs to amend his motion if we do this
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
well I would do amend as described and
 
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
with the second agree okay
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
so we would amend at this place and
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere I type statue instead of
 
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.529 align:start position:0%
everywhere I type statue instead of
statute

00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
two of which have been already noted and
 
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
there may be others but wherever okay
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
all of all in favor of accepting the
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
minutes as amended please say aye aye
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
here's what I hope we will do going
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
forward and this is after consultation
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
with my immediate predecessor as chair
 
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.029 align:start position:0%
with my immediate predecessor as chair
uh

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
it will go to
 
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
the joint
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
oversight committee which meets on the
 
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.210 align:start position:0%
oversight committee which meets on the
28th

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
28th
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
out of which this subcommittee was spun
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
and oversight we'll take a look at it
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
and have a go at it and we'll discuss it
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
and whatever and some of us here are
 
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
also on oversight so we'll be there
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
and out of that possibly could come in
 
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.490 align:start position:0%
and out of that possibly could come in
LSR

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
LSR
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
now I realize this is a rush but I
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
didn't invent this schedule
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
and an LSR could come out of oversight
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
but we will have a couple of months to
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
amend it and my guess is any bill that
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
comes out would go to Edna
 
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.830 align:start position:0%
comes out would go to Edna
and

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
we will have a couple of months from the
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
LSR coming out
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh before Edna would work on it and that
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
way it could be tweaked it can be
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
whatever and an amendment could be
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
offered at that time
 
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
so while this is for the next few weeks
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be rushed what we produce
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
possibly out of oversight is not the
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
final work product
 
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.490 align:start position:0%
final work product
okay

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
um I'd like before we present your
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
motion representative I'd like to hear
 
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
from anybody who wishes to come up to
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
testify briefly and for that the chair
 
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
recognizes attorney Holly Haynes who has
 
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
eight pages of her testimony
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
so if you would like to come up please
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
and there's one very important
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
requirement of testifying here do you
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
know what it is
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you chair
 
00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
I have brought amended copies of my
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
testimony since the last hearing thank
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
you very much for Speed allowing me to
 
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
speak today by the way because I had a
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
conversation with David Lowenstein the
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
chair of the National Practitioner Data
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
Bank after this hearing and he clarified
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
one point that was included in my
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
testimony and I wanted to make sure that
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
that was corrected for the written
 
00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.669 align:start position:0%
that was corrected for the written
record

00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
I have several copies I don't think I
 
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
have quite enough for everyone in the
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
group but I'll pass them around what I
 
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:12.529 align:start position:0%
group but I'll pass them around what I
have

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
and specifically what
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr Lowenstein informed me was that
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
his website the National Practitioner
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
databank's website was incorrect and
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
they had incorrect information on which
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
I was relying I believe that my
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
testimony said that New Hampshire was
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
one of Nine States out of compliance and
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
he has since fixed the website and New
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is no longer reported as out
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
of compliance on their website so I just
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct that for the record
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
um speaking with Mr Lowenstein though I
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
was able to get a lot of additional
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
information about
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements for the Board
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
of Medicine and are for the National
 
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank and what
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
information the Board of Medicine in
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
fact receives we heard a lot of
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
testimony at the last hearing about
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
the board can't do anything if they
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the information that was
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
something that we heard I think from
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
several of the witnesses and according
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
to Mr Lowenstein at the National
 
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank under federal law
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
all insurers whenever a medical
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
malpractice payment is made it has to be
 
00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:15.299 align:start position:0%
reported to the National Practitioner
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
Data Bank within 30 days federal law
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
also requires that that report be copied
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
to the applicable State Board of
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
Medicine so the State Board of Medicine
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
receives it at the time and they always
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
have that information it's just whether
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
or not they choose to publish that on
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
their website we know that Massachusetts
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
does we know that New Hampshire does not
 
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.490 align:start position:0%
does we know that New Hampshire does not
um

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
as we also learned at the last
 
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.490 align:start position:0%
as we also learned at the last
subcommittee

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
hearing oplc director Lindsey Courtney
 
00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:45.419 align:start position:0%
testified that
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
nothing is done nothing is made public
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
at the Board of Medicine unless
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
discipline is imposed I think that's one
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
of the biggest failings in the
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
transparency that we need to address
 
00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
at the same time at the hearing the
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
former chair of the Board of Medicine
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
David Conway testified that often
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
violations of the disciplinary statute
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
are bound but no discipline is imposed I
 
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
think in those cases it also is
 
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
imperative that that be made public
 
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
because the public has a right to know
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
when there are violations of the
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
disciplinary statute
 
00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:19.310 align:start position:0%
disciplinary statute
um

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
since this hearing we had a meeting of
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association for
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
justice medical malpractice group as
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
well so we could discuss potential
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
Solutions or suggestions that we had for
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and my
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the prior hearing
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
stay the same I think we need to
 
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
increase transparency by reporting all
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice payments paid by our
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this position all
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
reciprocal discipline that's imposed by
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
any other state all formal complaints
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
that are founded and investigations that
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
are conducted and the findings and how
 
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
those complaints are disposed of I think
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
that should be public especially if
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
they're bound not to be founded a
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
physician should be happy that they are
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
I guess exonerated on the website by
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
stating that a complaint was filed and
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
it was bound to have no merit or not be
 
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.490 align:start position:0%
it was bound to have no merit or not be
founded

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
founded
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
um the second is by protecting the
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
public and changing the manner that the
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings happen I think
 
00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
that's probably one of the bigger issues
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed
 
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.250 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed
um

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
Emily Baker and David Conway will
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
testify that link I think it was pretty
 
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
clear that the board does not have the
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
funding and they don't have the
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
bandwidth and they don't have the time
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
to provide meaningful discipline to
 
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.730 align:start position:0%
to provide meaningful discipline to
positions

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
they're a volunteer board they're made
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
up of volunteers I believe their
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
testimony was that it takes years
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes just to get through complaints
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
they provided some conflicting testimony
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
Dr Baker said that every complaint as a
 
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
formal investigation Dr Conway said that
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
many complaints are found to be without
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
merits so they aren't investigated
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
complaints that seem to have Merit
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
receive a formal investigation so there
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
was some conflicting testimony I think
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
what was clear from this though they
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
need funding Dr Baker alluded to it
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if they had funding to
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
send complaints to out-of-state expert
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
witnesses to in the applicable specialty
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
so they can review complaints for
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
Barrett because New Hampshire is such a
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
small and insular State all doctors know
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
each other and it's hard for one doctor
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
to pass judgment on another doctor that
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
they may see at Society meetings or in
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
their own Hospital
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
the Board needs funding for that they
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
need as the Director said funding for
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
the website they need
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
one of the suggestions that our group
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Association for
 
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
justice came up with was creating a
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
system similar to the attorney
 
00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:49.580 align:start position:0%
discipline office
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
which is a formal disciplinary
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
proceeding it's not made up of
 
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers there's a paid lawyer who
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
screens all complaints that come in
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
screen some against the statute review
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
some for sufficient evidence then
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
there's a formal investigation and
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
there's a Prosecuting lawyer and there's
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
a hearings panel there are several
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
different steps but they're all formal
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
and they're paid employees they are not
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
volunteers so they're people whose job
 
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
is dedicated to solely
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
reviewing disciplinary complaints and
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
investigating them and imposing
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
discipline when warranted I think that's
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
something that everyone in our committee
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
thought might be helpful and one way the
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
attorney discipline system is funded in
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which we thought could be
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
replicated under the Board of Medicine
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
is we pay and administrative fee
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
just to be admitted to the bar of the
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
state we pay a fee for attorney
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
discipline we pay it every year at
 
00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:48.539 align:start position:0%
annual renewal and our fees fund the
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
prosecuting attorneys for the discipline
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
the attorney discipline office that's
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
something that could be added to
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
physician licensing fees and it would
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
provide funding for a more formal
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
meaningful disciplinary system at the
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
board and that would allow also for the
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
funding for the website public reporting
 
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
and increased transparency
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
these are just some of the suggestions
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
that we came up with
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
um I think first and foremost the
 
00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:18.299 align:start position:0%
purpose of this committee was
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
transparency so the reporting
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
requirements is the most important there
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
are several ways that the reporting can
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
be done first when the board receives
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
the report from the National
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank that a payment
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
was made the board can add that to the
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
physician's licensing
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
page on the website they can do that at
 
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
the time it's received they could do it
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
annually at renewal when they're
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
renewing the positions license because
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
they are looking at the data Bank to see
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
if any payments have been made they
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
could do without licensing or they could
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
pay an annual query fee for all
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
positions in New Hampshire this is
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
something else that could be done
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
according to Mr Lowenstein States vary
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
in their processes that there are many
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
states in the nation that do just pay an
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
annual query fee so they can receive
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
reports on all of their positions each
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
year other states do it just at renewal
 
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
and other states do it just at new
 
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
licensing but the process is vary there
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
is a procedure there and with a query
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
fee the state of New Hampshire could do
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
that annually and they could have that
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
information to make public and finally
 
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.269 align:start position:0%
information to make public and finally
the

00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
complaints that we were discussing at
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
the last hearing
 
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.730 align:start position:0%
the last hearing
I

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
the trial lawyers understand and I I
 
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
think I explained at length how many
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
inquiries we get to our office that
 
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
don't have Merit it would be cost
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to bring it's not a claim
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
that we would pursue and we couldn't get
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
expert support for I'm certain that many
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
complaints of the Board of Medicine are
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
similar there are people who are upset
 
00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:48.419 align:start position:0%
because they had a really bad medical
 
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
outcome but it doesn't mean that
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
malpractice happened those are the types
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
of complaints that probably could
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
receive an initial screening and not be
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
found founded but anything further than
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
that if it's something that has been
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
filed in court the mandatory reporting
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
by the superior court that happens I
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
think that's something that should be
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
publicized because it's been found to
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
have at least some Merit enough to file
 
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit the
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
whenever an insurer makes a reservable
 
00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
claim they have their mandatory
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
reporting to the Board of Medicine that
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
means an insurer has reviewed it
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
internally with the medical expert
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's enough Merit to it for the
 
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.059 align:start position:0%
insurer to reserve money to make a
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
payment on the claim so it means they
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
think it has some Merit if a hospital
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
credentialing committee makes their
 
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting it means that
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
positions on that committee have found
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
at least some Merit to the claim those
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
are the types of complaints that I
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
respectfully submit should be put on the
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
board of medicine and whatever the
 
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
outcome of the investigation happens
 
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
whether it's bounded whether it's not
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
founded whether discipline is imposed or
 
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
not that should be made public as well
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
one thing that we did discuss is that it
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
seems the Board of Medicine has very
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
differing treatment and how they treat
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
complaints we heard differing testimony
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
from doctors Conway and Baker we also
 
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
know just from our experience as trial
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
lawyers experience that our clients have
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
had that
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
complaints that come from patients do
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
not receive the same
 
00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
rigor as complaints that come from other
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
doctors or complaints that come from
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals and there is specifically
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
there's one
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
doctor specifically On The Board of
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
Medicine who was reported by his
 
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
employer and received discipline it was
 
00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:31.269 align:start position:0%
employer and received discipline it was
a

00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
750 dollar fine and a restriction on
 
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.529 align:start position:0%
750 dollar fine and a restriction on
practicing

00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:36.539 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
multiple patients made individual
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
complaints about that position as well
 
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
and some before the employer made the
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
report those were dismissed and they
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
received they received a letter saying
 
00:33:51.889 --> 00:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
that the board wasn't going to take any
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
action then the employer reported the
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
exact same conduct for the exact same
 
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
patient's case and the board did look at
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
it and do an investigation I submit that
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
that treatment shouldn't be it's the
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
exact same conduct the exact same
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
position the exact same patient it
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
should have been treated the same
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
following that discipline additional
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
patients complained about the same
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
doctor and received letters stating the
 
00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:17.339 align:start position:0%
board's already looked at this we've
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
already imposed a fine we aren't going
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
to consider your complaint now the
 
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
problem is the scope of the misconduct
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
was so Broad and so many patients were
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
impacted a slap on the wrist because of
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
one employer report I don't think is
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
sufficient it's something this is a
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
position that also should have lost his
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
license since long before that happened
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
and long before those complaints came so
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
that would be my other suggestion and
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
that comes from our association that we
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that the board treat
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
complaints from patients take them just
 
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
as seriously as complaints that they
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
receive from other Physicians and other
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals and I'm happy to take any
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Solway uh thank
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
you so much uh councilor Hanks do you
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
have an electronic copy of your
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that you can send to me I do
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
can I give you my card sure thank you
 
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:14.470 align:start position:0%
I have a question
um

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
story about The Physician at CMC the
 
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.050 align:start position:0%
story about The Physician at CMC the
surgeon

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:23.060 align:start position:0%
surgeon
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
my understanding has been that neither
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
Eminem morbidity and Mobility or the
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
credentialing committee made a formal
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
complaint but docked individual doctors
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
from that facility did
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
and so I'm finding it I I have a gap I
 
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
guess in my understanding as to why the
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine didn't proceed did
 
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine didn't proceed did
they

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a clerk of a court it was an
 
00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:52.940 align:start position:0%
insurance company it wasn't a hospital
 
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
committee but it was Physicians and so
 
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
why do we not hear of what action was
 
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
taken next it helped me
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
um you can't read their minds but I
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
think I may have a gap in what I'm
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
understanding and I'm not familiar with
 
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
what Physicians did report to the Board
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
of Medicine I think it would be much
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
more helpful in Physicians that were
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
involved in that process were able to
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
testify to that because I don't know I'm
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
not familiar with those reports or what
 
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
the board knew I don't I do know that
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine had several formal
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that had been submitted by the
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
superior court against that position
 
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
over the years that they could have
 
00:36:34.329 --> 00:36:34.339 align:start position:0%
looked into
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
presumably therefore that the clerk of
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
the court passed that information on to
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
them as he or she is required they did
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
and so the board did have at least that
 
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.190 align:start position:0%
and so the board did have at least that
information

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the board was
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
provided with additional information on
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
many other cases but did not take action
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have any questions for
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
attorney Haynes representative Edwards
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I think I it feels
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
like I have three different things
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
um uh in your in your testimony you said
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
that there was conflict between Dr
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
Conway's and Dr Baker's testimony
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
regarding whether or not investigations
 
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
are done all the time and as I recall
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
the feeling that I had in during that
 
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:27.380 align:start position:0%
meeting was that
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
neither of them were keyed in on the
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
specific language in the statute on
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
there being informal investigations
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
versus formal investigations and so so
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
as I interpreted the differences between
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
their testimony I I chalked it up to
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
probably just speaking different
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
languages about what constitutes an
 
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
investigation and not and not a conflict
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
as much as they're just speaking to it
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
differently is is is that fair or do you
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
still believe that their testimony
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
collected that may be a fair inference
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
I'm the way I heard the testimony is how
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
I just testified because Dr Baker did
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
say that all complaints receive a formal
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
investigation so I I think that was the
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
difference it could be semantics and it
 
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
could be and an unfamiliarity with the
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
statutory language I'm getting older in
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
my memory stating I I I understood her
 
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
to say that they all were at least
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
received an informal investigation that
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
way they could determine whether or not
 
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
there was Merit to go to a formal
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
investigation or not maybe I wanted to
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
hear that because it made sense to me
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
but so I don't know what she said the
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
the before you go into your next Point
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you wish to speak
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
to this point
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it was
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
um and again I my memory is imperfect as
 
00:38:51.849 --> 00:38:51.859 align:start position:0%
well and my
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
understanding comes from my background
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
which is as an attorney and
 
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
um at least when I was practicing in in
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont there was
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
an initial screening which would not
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
have been called an investigation but a
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
complaint was filed uh an attorney for
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
the board would read that complaint
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
um and one would get a a letter marked
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
personal and confidential which was very
 
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:23.579 align:start position:0%
worrying when it showed up in your
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
mailbox uh saying would you care to
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
comment on this
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
and uh that happened to me once and I
 
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.650 align:start position:0%
and uh that happened to me once and I
did

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:32.660 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
and then they made it clear that nothing
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
that had been stated in that complaint
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
actually arose to accla an actual claim
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
of malpractice there was nothing there
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
there so there was a screening process
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
first which and and I think we may have
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
gotten caught up in the semantics of
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
screening versus
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
formal versus informal investigations
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that's an area that needs to
 
00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:04.510 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that's an area that needs to
become

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
clarified a bit
 
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
any anyone else on
 
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:12.740 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
you may go on to number two all right
 
00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:20.099 align:start position:0%
um all right so
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your written testimony you
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
made I think an outstanding point about
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
a potential way of maybe augmenting the
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
resources of the Board of Medicine and
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
use the comparison to the what the
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys do and I'm in the written
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
testimony here I'm not seeing that
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
description am I just missing it is that
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
in your written testimony because it's
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
such a good idea we may want to steal it
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
essentially word for word
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it's their word for
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
word in the written testimony but I did
 
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
make the suggestion of creating a
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
tribunal a prosecute a separate tribunal
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
outside of volunteers where you have
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting attorneys there's a limited
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
description in there but I did not
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
include the suggestion about the
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
physician licensing fees to fund it as
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
the attorney licensing fees fund the
 
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
attorney discipline office okay for for
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
our for our clerk if if you've got
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
something that's easy to copy paste you
 
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
know or it'd be great because I think
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
we'd want to look at that I'm happy to
 
00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:20.339 align:start position:0%
submit something additional and then uh
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
as I was listening to your testimony
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
you're very disciplined like a good
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer as you had you know sort of your
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
bullet statements and I was trying to
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
follow along on your on the bullet
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
statements inside your testimony and and
 
00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:35.099 align:start position:0%
I couldn't correlate them and it's
 
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:37.940 align:start position:0%
probably just me not
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
focusing properly but do you do you
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
think all of the bullet statements that
 
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
you made that for your recommendations
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
are actually in this written testimony
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
or do you believe you're you verbally
 
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
augmented what you wrote I believe I
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
verbally augmented what I wrote Because
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
I know that I did not include the
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
position licensing fee portion in the
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
written testimony I do know that that's
 
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
not in there I believe that everything
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
else that I discussed is contained in
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
the written document though just maybe
 
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
not in the same detail okay thanks I'm
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
such a bad clerk when I do it I just
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
need as many uh training wheels as I get
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
so but thank you for that
 
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy uh thank you Mr
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank you for your
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
testimony again
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
when you refer to the attorney
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
discipline office that you referenced
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
before the process seems to me to be
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
similar to what happens in the Board of
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
Medicine currently where I think it was
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
Dr Conway who was an investigative
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
physician for the medical review
 
00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.099 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the board actually did
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
the initial screenings and if it reached
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
a certain threshold then it was brought
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
to a full board meeting to see if it
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
actually had Merit and my question is is
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
that how it is done with the in the
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
attorney discipline office that you have
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
do they do an initial screening that is
 
00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
then referred to a larger board group uh
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
among the attorneys
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
I do know and I'm sorry that there's
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
something blocking yeah I do know that
 
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
there is an initial screening but the
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
screening is done by a paid uh there's a
 
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
screening a complaint attorney who
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
actually does the initial screening and
 
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.890 align:start position:0%
actually does the initial screening and
does

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
um look for evidence or violation of the
 
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
statute that's the initial review and
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
recommends prosecution then there's a
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
separate prosecution attorney so it's
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
not a volunteer position I think that
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
the difference and this may be one of
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
the difficulties with the board is that
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
everything at the board of medicine is
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer so you're relying on people
 
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
who are volunteering their time who may
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
not have the time or the resources to
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
devote to
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions nope saying none
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
thanks so much for your testimony thank
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
I don't see any more pink important
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
message pink card substitutes
 
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
um is there anybody and you just haven't
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
filled it out and brought it up
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
saying none
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
then the chair recognizes the clerk who
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
has a s a draft of
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
a possible statement to go over to
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that meets on the
 
00:44:13.619 --> 00:44:14.690 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that meets on the
28th

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
28th
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
if I may take a moment Mr chair to pass
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
these out do you have winter I do
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.560 --> 00:45:43.089 align:start position:0%
 
episode

00:45:43.089 --> 00:45:43.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman ladies and
 
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.609 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman ladies and
gentlemen

00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
gentlemen
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
um I think we can hold off for a minute
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
because I find whenever I hand things
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
out they'd rather read them than listen
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
to me and that may be true for you too I
 
00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
don't know you're a professor
 
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:54.530 align:start position:0%
don't know you're a professor
um

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
well I realized that representative
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
salivaay said that he would give us a
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
moment because he
 
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
knew that we might want to read rather
 
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
than listen to him so if he would like
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
to make a statement first that's I would
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
defer but I have some comments when when
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
he's finished
 
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative Solway uh thank you Mr
 
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank you for your
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
patience representative Weber
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
um the document that you have before you
 
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
is a draft it is not a draft of an LSR
 
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
it is a draft of a recommendation
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
to the oversight committee uh for Health
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
and Human Services that it developed on
 
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.550 align:start position:0%
and Human Services that it developed on
LSR

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
LSR
 
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:17.540 align:start position:0%
pursuant to its own preferences however
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
the draft that I've provided is offered
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
as a beginning step
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
only a beginning step
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
it begins with the sense that uh
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
any organization that employs a
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
physician within the state
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
will uh convene in timely fashion
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
internal review committees and hospitals
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
certainly do this but other
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
organizations that employ physicians may
 
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
or may not this would provide a
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement that they do so
 
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:02.180 align:start position:0%
these committees are typically called
 
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
variously and some organizations have
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
all of these
 
00:49:10.329 --> 00:49:10.339 align:start position:0%
some have won some have not
 
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
credentialing committee morbidian
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
mortality committee tissue committee or
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
complaint committee and these are the
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
mechanisms by which organizations that
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
employ Physicians review the performance
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
of their Physicians
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the course
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
of these deliberations
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
this recommendation goes on
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
these internal review committees will do
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
their own investigation
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
and we would assume that they do that
 
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.770 align:start position:0%
and we would assume that they do that
already

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
and in any case in which
 
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
an internal Review Committee finds what
 
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
it thinks to be a lapse in professional
 
00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.109 align:start position:0%
it thinks to be a lapse in professional
practice

00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
and in which it recommends disciplinary
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
action keep in mind this then removes
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
from discussion those investigations in
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
which disciplinary action is not
 
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.170 align:start position:0%
which disciplinary action is not
recommended

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:11.180 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
and in which
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
and in which that disciplinary action uh
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
directs the limitation or suspension of
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
physician privileges in order to protect
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
patient well-being
 
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
the organization the employing
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
organization is required to report this
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire Board of Medicine
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
now this is in no way this in no way
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
contravenes does not affect in any way
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
the standing provision that the clerk of
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
superior court reports to the New
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Medicine any judicial
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
finding of malpractice which comes
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
before it and results in the finding of
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
malpractice this is a different issue
 
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.170 align:start position:0%
malpractice this is a different issue
entirely

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:06.260 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine shall then
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
investigate the disciplinary action by
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
the Health Care Organization
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
that has resulted in limitation of
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
suspension of Privileges and will then
 
00:51:20.569 --> 00:51:20.579 align:start position:0%
consider its own actions appropriate
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
within its Authority
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
to regulate physician practice
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
now in order to do this the Board of
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
Medicine is going to need resources
 
00:51:34.089 --> 00:51:34.099 align:start position:0%
and so the Board of Medicine
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
shall seek that I'm disciplined I must
 
00:51:41.809 --> 00:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
say by attorney Haynes uh review of uh
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
practice among attorneys uh I think
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea but here it states
 
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
that um the Board of Medicine will seek
 
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
such additional funding
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh in the budget process to staff its
 
00:51:55.079 --> 00:51:56.630 align:start position:0%
uh in the budget process to staff its
responsibilities

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
to remunerate volunteer positions for
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
travel and and this is an issue that
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
arose in our discussions with the Board
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
of Medicine and to make known to the
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
public by means of appropriate media its
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
findings and the board has indicated
 
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
that they need help in developing the
 
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
website in order to do that so that's
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
built in here as well as you look at
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
this you will note that this is crafted
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
in a series of stages it is not simply
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
oh hospitals need to report in fractions
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
it is if there is a report and if there
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
is an investigation and if there is
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action then that gets
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
reported to the board and then the board
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
assumes responsibility for its own
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
investigation and its own disciplinary
 
00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:54.740 align:start position:0%
actions so it's a staged response
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
to the complaint
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh and now I'm looking forward to
 
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's
 
00:53:07.809 --> 00:53:07.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the work on this
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
um because I think it's encapsulated an
 
00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
awful lot of what we've talked about so
 
00:53:14.819 --> 00:53:17.150 align:start position:0%
awful lot of what we've talked about so
far

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
I would not
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
um frame it as a directive to draft an
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
LSR with the following Provisions
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
because I think it's more a list of
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
issues or consideration by the oversight
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
board some of which would not in my
 
00:53:43.329 --> 00:53:43.339 align:start position:0%
opinion actually be part of an LSR
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
in particular the the final one the
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine functioning is a body
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
of volunteer professionals shall seek
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
such additional funding as is necessary
 
00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:57.260 align:start position:0%
um I I think you can either
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
ask somebody to
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
um draft a statute about how such a
 
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
board is going to come into such a
 
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
how such a position is going to come
 
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.349 align:start position:0%
how such a position is going to come
into

00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
effect and how it's going to be funded
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
but I think that's something that the
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
legislature has to draft and consider
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
after appropriate public comment rather
 
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
than directing another organization to
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
come up with that so that's that's
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of Distinction I'm
 
00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:32.339 align:start position:0%
thinking about it's something that I
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
think definitely ought to be considered
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
but I my real my only real concern here
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
is is with the second paragraph which
 
00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.710 align:start position:0%
is is with the second paragraph which
says

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.569 align:start position:0%
says
um

00:54:43.569 --> 00:54:43.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
recommended that the oversight committee
 
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
submit to the House of Representatives
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
and the Senate Aid directive to draft an
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
LSR with the following Provisions I I
 
00:54:54.849 --> 00:54:54.859 align:start position:0%
would say something more like
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee consider it the
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
following issues in considering
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
legislation I do think that the two
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
pieces that I think are very important
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
and and certainly there can be tweaks
 
00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
down the road but I think setting out
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
clearly that there is going to be some
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
kind of oversight
 
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.329 align:start position:0%
kind of oversight
without

00:55:19.329 --> 00:55:19.339 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
directing what it is and my my nitpicky
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
thing about paragraph three is if you
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
say such committees may be constituted
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
as credentialing morbidity and mortality
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
tissue or complaint committees that
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
you're limiting it to just those and you
 
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:39.130 align:start position:0%
you're limiting it to just those and you
other

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:39.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:41.900 align:start position:0%
organizations that
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
employee physicians may have different
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
proceedings so I think we're in one of
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
those conditions where you say you have
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
to have some kind of
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
review but you don't tell them
 
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
specifically and again that could be as
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
simple as saying
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to the
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
following uh where and then maybe the
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
words were appropriate because you know
 
00:56:10.809 --> 00:56:10.819 align:start position:0%
I don't really know about
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
freestanding entities of various sorts
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
and how they deal with those kinds of
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
reviews so
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
um again that that might be squishier or
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I I think your point about what has
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
to be reported I'm this was something I
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
was trying to get at when I was asking
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
questions about substituting shell for
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
May because I think
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
May investigate is really way too
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
squishy and I think if the oversight
 
00:56:49.089 --> 00:56:49.099 align:start position:0%
committee considers at which point
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
they must investigate I think that's the
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
nub of what you're talking about here
 
00:56:56.809 --> 00:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know whether you would
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
want to delineate in statute you could
 
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.910 align:start position:0%
want to delineate in statute you could
uh

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
the various levels of us an initial
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
screening and then and then the
 
00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099 align:start position:0%
difference between an informal
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
investigation and a formal investigation
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's something that
 
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
people want to go into that level of
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
detail but I do think getting the word
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
shall in there at some level is is very
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
important that I
 
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.609 align:start position:0%
important that I
um

00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
do take the counselor's point that
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the public it's much more
 
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:34.910 align:start position:0%
in terms of the public it's much more
helpful

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
to note that a complaint was made and
 
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.950 align:start position:0%
to note that a complaint was made and
dismissed

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
dismissed
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
but balancing that with
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
the public saying well that was a
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
terrible thing because they had a
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
terrible outcome
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
is is a tough one because there are
 
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
plenty of terrible outcomes where there
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
um mistake or malpractice in terms of of
 
00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
generally accepted
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
best practices it just didn't work out
 
00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
the way you wanted it to
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
so I guess that's my bunch of comments I
 
00:58:22.569 --> 00:58:22.579 align:start position:0%
representative soloway please respond uh
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that helps a
 
00:58:25.319 --> 00:58:26.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that helps a
lot

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues that you raise that
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
kept me up at night quite literally that
 
00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:35.900 align:start position:0%
in the drug
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
is that the way this is written there is
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
not a mechanism for solo practitioners
 
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
who don't belong to healthcare
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
organizations and I really didn't know
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
how to finesse that uh I don't have the
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
verbiage for it however in your wisdom
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
you have indicated that uh this may be a
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation for oversight as a
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
general area of concern and
 
00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
consideration uh that uh should not
 
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
specify the contents of an LSR but it is
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
an area of for consideration and that
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps oversight can look at it and
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
remand it to a house committee on health
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh on
 
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
health and elderly Affairs Health Human
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
Services and not only Affairs
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
and likewise the same Committee in the
 
00:59:33.849 --> 00:59:33.859 align:start position:0%
Senate but that's very helpful thank you
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative on this note I would like
 
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
00:59:39.549 --> 00:59:39.559 align:start position:0%
um it should be the responsible
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility of any organization which
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
employs Physicians license to practice
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you do know I am
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
chairman of the board of one of those
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
yes however sir
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
um you do not have a solo practitioner
 
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
who is practicing outside an
 
01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.010 align:start position:0%
who is practicing outside an
organization

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
you you're a practitioner is within an
 
01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.089 align:start position:0%
you you're a practitioner is within an
organization

01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
we have presently two pcps and are
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
hoping to replace the third one so is
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
would this language suggest that we
 
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
establish such an internal Review
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
Committee absolutely so then it would
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
possibly be the case that non-medical
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question it would
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
certainly be the purview of the
 
01:00:37.609 --> 01:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
organization itself to determine uh who
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
would be on their committees
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
so and it would very likely include
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
people who were not Physicians perhaps
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
as far afield as a cleric
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
um who believes in statues but not
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
statutes yes yeah
 
01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.809 align:start position:0%
statutes yes yeah
um

01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:01.010 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
that might include
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
um Hollow statues
 
01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:09.380 align:start position:0%
that you know that so but
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
there's a real question I mean how am I
 
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
going to set this up if this goes in the
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
way you've got it
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
well I my failure and I have thought
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
about this is what if you have a locally
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
practicing physician who is not a member
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
of an organization and therefore not
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
supervised by such a committee okay so
 
01:01:35.569 --> 01:01:35.579 align:start position:0%
are they are they free and clear except
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
when except when there's a complaint
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
filed to the court
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
or whether they file a citizen complaint
 
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
so the whole issue of screening by a
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
hospital or Health Center committee
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
would not occur okay
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
in fact that's one of the concerns that
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
I have further down because we're back
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
to the who has jurisdiction to make a
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
complaint to the Board of Medicine it's
 
01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the superior court or a
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
certain Committee in the hospital and I
 
01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:15.299 align:start position:0%
would maintain that if the committee of
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
the hospital does not complain but
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
should have a physician in that hospital
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
or outside of that hospital should have
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
standing to make the complaint so there
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
needs to be a not you know it could
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
include but not limited to down in that
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
fourth paragraph perhaps
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
or could I suggest that we're making it
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
a little too complicated because
 
01:02:41.329 --> 01:02:41.339 align:start position:0%
everybody has the right to complain now
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that we have heard that
 
01:02:48.049 --> 01:02:48.059 align:start position:0%
there are issues of how much weight is
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
given to each particular entity who
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
complains but I would be very much
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to getting into any statute
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
which limited who may complain this
 
01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:03.740 align:start position:0%
statute it seems to me should be
 
01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
directed to who has a duty to complain
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
and I want to be very clear that nothing
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
that I have said addresses the issue
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
that representative salary raised which
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
is the solo practitioner that's going to
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
have to be for either others who
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
practice with them and that could
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps be other employees in their
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
practice although that's very
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable for the employees it could
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
certainly be patients who are great
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
grief and it probably would also be
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
colleagues who have seen the effects of
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
something that has gone wrong but in
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
those cases I don't see how you can
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
mandate an internal review of one by one
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't think that's going to be
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
very useful and
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
the issue raised by
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson is one that perhaps
 
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
people might want to think about in
 
01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:09.260 align:start position:0%
terms of the size of the organization
 
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
which is mandated to have some kind of
 
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
review although I would submit that if
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
you have an organization which employees
 
01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.069 align:start position:0%
you have an organization which employees
do

01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
you probably have some kind of internal
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
reviews already we do and it's it's it
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
may not be a morbidity board but if you
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
have some kind of internal review then
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
you're then you're home free
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
um but I I think that um
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
again being too specific is going to run
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
afoul of
 
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.730 align:start position:0%
afoul of
um

01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:48.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
non-traditional practices of one sort or
 
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.089 align:start position:0%
non-traditional practices of one sort or
another

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:52.099 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm also not sure whether we whether
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
this goes just Physicians or
 
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
um other Specialties as well that's
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
that's one question I would have but
 
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
that's one question I would have but
um

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
I think it
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
is better framed in terms of concerns to
 
01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
be pursued rather than an LSR to be
 
01:05:17.099 --> 01:05:18.710 align:start position:0%
be pursued rather than an LSR to be
drafted

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative salary for taking this
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
stab at this um possible LSR I would
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
mention here that in the third paragraph
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
there's no question in my mind having
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
worked in hospital for many decades that
 
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
the Bad actors in a hospital those that
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
are not performing quality work unknown
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
to those that are working in the
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
hospital at all levels nurses Physicians
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
other Physicians
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
um Texan they are everybody knows who is
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
not performing well so that's where I
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
believe it should start and I think this
 
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
is basically identifying the hospital as
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
a spot where it should start
 
01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.270 align:start position:0%
a spot where it should start
um

01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
it probably would not be the
 
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
credentialing committees probably the
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
privileging Committees credentialing is
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
really where you realize somebody's has
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
a license or a college degree or
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
whatever privileging is where they come
 
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
up with the privileges in the hospital
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
itself and what they can and cannot do
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
m m conferences are protected by quality
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
assurance and therefore probably would
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
not be a source of this information but
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest is that there is a
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place in many hospitals
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
where the medical staff office which has
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
a president of the medical staff is
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the place where many
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
complaints from within the hospital are
 
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
actually funneled
 
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
in many hospitals also the medical staff
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
president actually reports directly to
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
the Board of Trustees and I think that's
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
an important point that they're not
 
01:06:48.529 --> 01:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
responding they're not reporting to
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
leadership leadership has a different
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
lens sometimes in the hospital with
 
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
regard to the um the the workings of the
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
hospital where the trustees have a
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility not only to the
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
organization but to the community and I
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
think that if the medical staff has the
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
direct link to the trustees then they
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
are the ones that can act in vis-a-vis
 
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
with my next point would be who does the
 
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:16.940 align:start position:0%
reporting to the Board of Medicine
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
I think it was evident to me in the CMC
 
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
and again that's only one example but
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
having said that those that have quote a
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
a very high earner say or somebody that
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
they do not want to in any way
 
01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.089 align:start position:0%
they do not want to in any way
compromise

01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes is less incentive to report
 
01:07:36.529 --> 01:07:36.539 align:start position:0%
that person I'm not saying always but
 
01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
they can be the case in those
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
circumstances and I think the trustees
 
01:07:43.609 --> 01:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
may be the right vehicle by which any
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
complaints that come through the medical
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
staff office assess the individual or
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
the problem and then be the ones that
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
directly report to the Board of Medicine
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.630 align:start position:0%
directly report to the Board of Medicine
um

01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
in your second to last paragraph there I
 
01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
think it would be the Board of Medicine
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
that regulates the licensing they don't
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
regulate privileges in for the providers
 
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate this and I think it
 
01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
gets at the heart of the matter in my
 
01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
mind where the problem is first
 
01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:12.299 align:start position:0%
identified and then who should do the
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
reporting and how should they get
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
information about what happens in a
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
hospital and I would argue that in many
 
01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
places medical staff offices have that
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
direct Pipeline and they are solid lines
 
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Trustees maybe a dotted
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
line to the c-suite but again that would
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
be the line of you know of action that I
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
would take my two other suggestions here
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
that I was thinking about since this
 
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
does involve many of the operations in
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
workings of the hospital might it be
 
01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:41.420 align:start position:0%
helpful to have the hospital Association
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
present to actually comment on what this
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
would mean as far as an organizational
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
shift within many of the hospitals
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
and also at the very end of this should
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
we potentially be adding if we're going
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
to present this to the committee in two
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
weeks or the end of next week should we
 
01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:02.060 align:start position:0%
also be putting in some language about
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
transparency whether it is
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
um issues regarding if somebody is still
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
licensed if somebody is been suspended
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
their privileges revoked whatever that
 
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
may be that's on their website should we
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
identify things that we can use as
 
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
transparency issues including
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
potentially as in Vermont not far from
 
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
where I live that if you have a suit not
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
a suit that was any suit but a suit that
 
01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:27.980 align:start position:0%
was actually
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
resolved in the favor of the plaintiff
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
or the patient within the last 10 years
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
it was listed as a case but not any
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
specific so again I was thinking about
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
adding other things in addition to your
 
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
good work right here as well
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
um I you and I agree thoroughly
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
on the role of the president of the
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
medical staff
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
um that's a great insight and I
 
01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
um you suggest that the president of the
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
medical staff has a reporting
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
relationship to the Board of Trustees
 
01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:05.930 align:start position:0%
relationship to the Board of Trustees
um

01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
several of us here have walked Hospital
 
01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.550 align:start position:0%
several of us here have walked Hospital
corridors

01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
corridors
 
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
and been in boardrooms and I'm going to
 
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
ask you whether you think that the
 
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
members of a Board of Trustees would be
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
the most competent forum for
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
investigating challenges to uh
 
01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:31.149 align:start position:0%
investigating challenges to uh
privileges

01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I'm not sure
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
that they would necessarily understand
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
potentially the credentialing and
 
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
privileging but I think it is their
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
responsibility as the ultimate governing
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
body of a hospital to be the ones that
 
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
have a significant fiduciary
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
responsibility not only to the hospital
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
but to the community and therefore they
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
should be in my mind as opposed to
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
others in any Hospital situation may
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
have a bias or a lens that
 
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.649 align:start position:0%
have a bias or a lens that
um

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:02.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
sometimes is clouded I think the
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
trustees in their role have the ultimate
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility and again this is a point
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
of discussion it was only brought up as
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
a suggestion but my other concern
 
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
besides identifying the fact that it is
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
clearly within the hospital that people
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
identify and know who is not performing
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
well my question and again I'm open to
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
anybody else's suggestion is how does
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
that information get to the Board of
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
Medicine to act upon
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
and I only I would only disagree with
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
one other point that was made previously
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
in my mind there is no frivolous lawsuit
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
because if you ask any physician any
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is a problem it's emotionally
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
and financially taxing so I I don't like
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
the word frivolous lawsuit because it is
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
not frivolous to The Physician or the PA
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
or the nurse practitioner that's at the
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
end of a Barb on that in that thing so
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm a bit cautious about
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
every lawsuit being aired into the open
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
because there are so many instances
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
where they are dismissed and that can be
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
a real problem for any practice and
 
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
physician to have a laundry list of
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
suits that were quote frivolous or
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
really not significant but they should
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
know that you had a lawsuit that
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately ended up in Damages to any
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
patient or individual and was
 
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
compensated as such so I would I would
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
not probably have every lawsuit open to
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
the public but I think those that are
 
01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
egregious and those that public should
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
know about will be aired in the Board of
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
Medicine so thank you someone and you
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
know the stack is getting higher and
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
higher I think it may have been Board of
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
Medicine that gave me a chart starting
 
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.530 align:start position:0%
Medicine that gave me a chart starting
with

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
the smallest little yishuna
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
all the way up to you should be shot at
 
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
Sunrise and a lot of things in between
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
and the question is at what level do
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
those things become public it's I was
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
never a news but I uh newspapers but I
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
was on radio as a talk show host and I
 
01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:14.300 align:start position:0%
know that a a story gets the big play
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
and the exoneration
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
I am having a meeting with the board the
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
hospital Association later this week so
 
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
represent it to anybody over here
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards next
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair as I'm as I'm
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
looking at this document I I'm I'm
 
01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
seeing some headings that are popping
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
out and I like headings and we get into
 
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
uh the information flow from uh where
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
patient care is taking place getting it
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine I think there
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
was a rough consensus that one of the
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
biggest things that we ought to try to
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
address is to make sure that the Board
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
of Medicine had more information because
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
we made the observation that you don't
 
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
know what you don't know and that we
 
01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
wanted to make more things knowable so
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the the information flow of this is a
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
pretty major paragraph and it's one of
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
the heavy lifts I think that we want to
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
be able to do second paragraph is on the
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
investigation part we've used word
 
01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
screen informal formal investigations
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
and the status of the things what you
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
know but and I I think it may already be
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the statute but it would be worth
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
looking at again just to make sure that
 
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
we're clear on the semantics around
 
01:14:44.699 --> 01:14:47.270 align:start position:0%
we're clear on the semantics around
investigations

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
the third big paragraph is the is kind
 
01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
of the determination step for the Board
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
of Medicine you know what what once they
 
01:14:59.630 --> 01:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
have this investigation completed they
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
need to determine whether or not it's
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
reportable or not and and you just
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned sir that there's probably this
 
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
big long list of
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
transactions and and we probably need to
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
draw the line uh in that somewhere
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
saying these are reportable these are
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
not kind of thing just just for clarity
 
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
and then the last paragraph I think
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
starts to hit on Manpower Manpower and
 
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
money and and and so uh Miss Haynes had
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
a suggestion we may want to consider or
 
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
or not just throw it to the general
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
court to staff at nor to fund it I don't
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
know but but that's a whole separate
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
section is the Manpower and money part
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
of this I I did if you'll let me go on
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
just a little longer have a question
 
01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.950 align:start position:0%
just a little longer have a question
about

01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.649 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:15:50.649 --> 01:15:50.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
the information flow Miss Haynes had
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned something that I don't think
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
is in this paragraph four that maybe we
 
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
missed and that is she talked about how
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
all malpractice is reported to some
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
National Database and simultaneously
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
those malpractice notifications get sent
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
to the boards of medicine and I see the
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
last sentence of this paragraph saying
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the superior court is
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
likewise directed to report to the Board
 
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
of Medicine I I don't know if that's
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
sufficient I don't know if that captures
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
what Miss Haynes was saying in terms of
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
who is generating the malpractice
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
information I I just don't remember
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
testimony well enough and she had to
 
01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
let me just finish the thought and then
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
I'll come back
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
um okay so I I don't know if we've got a
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
sufficient who in addition to the clerk
 
01:16:58.610 --> 01:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
of superior court and then this sentence
 
01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
sort of trails off it says that uh the
 
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
the you know there shall any any
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
judicial finding and malpractice which
 
01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
comes before it and which results in a
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
finding a malpractice well what what are
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
we going to do with those are we are we
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to is this is this what we're
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to investigate those
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
or or we by definition going to report
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
them I I think there's some clarity
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
around the malpractice issue that I'm
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to say that I'm not sure that that
 
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
is standing is correct I think doesn't
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the Superior Court have to
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
report to the Board of Medicine when
 
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
there is a filing of a lawsuit does it
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
have to actually be adjudicated before
 
01:17:41.649 --> 01:17:41.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
I believe so and I believe there was
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
testimony last time due to the fact that
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
settlements outside of Corps aren't
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
reported to the board but once it gets
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
to once they get to court so it doesn't
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
have to be which results in a finding of
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
malpractice it's the mere bringing of
 
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
the suit into the court system
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes I'll admit I I could be completely
 
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
wrong what I could have sworn I heard I
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
want to nail this one down before we
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
but that's my recollection of the
 
01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.910 align:start position:0%
but that's my recollection of the
testimony

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
um yeah mine too I want to be careful
 
01:18:17.169 --> 01:18:17.179 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
you have raised a very interesting issue
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
if one comes before the court
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
and defends against an allegation of
 
01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.550 align:start position:0%
and defends against an allegation of
malpractice

01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
malpractice
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
and is found not guilty of malpractice
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
would it not be within American
 
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
jurisprudence that a finding of not
 
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
guilty does not require reporting to the
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
 
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.850 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
foreign

01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:51.860 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
off your phrase this provision shall
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
stand along current practice
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this is current practice
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
but you list in the next two lines I
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure maybe it should
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
be but I'm not sure it is a
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative Weber well without
 
01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
getting into the very specifics because
 
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
we are going to get bogged down in the
 
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
weeds with all the little
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
details that we can explore
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
my mind I think was working very much
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
along the same lines as representative
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
Edwards and I came up with five headings
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
which was and the questions rather than
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
prescriptions one is at what level
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
must something be reported
 
01:19:44.689 --> 01:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
who reports it
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
and then what gets reported to the
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
public at what level do you report to
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
the public and I I I'm not ready to make
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
answers to any of those questions and
 
01:20:00.649 --> 01:20:00.659 align:start position:0%
then the fifth peace is the Manpower and
 
01:20:03.370 --> 01:20:03.380 align:start position:0%
the money for the investigations which
 
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
is is sort of a separate thing but if we
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
look at them at at those and if we look
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
at them as
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
the threshold for a mandate
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
and we reserve
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
the right of everybody to report if if
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
you know if I've got a hangnail and I'm
 
01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
upset about it I can report it but the
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
board's probably not going to do
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
anything about it and that's as it
 
01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
um if you it seems to me that for
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
transparency what we're trying to do is
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
set the level at which information must
 
01:20:44.290 --> 01:20:44.300 align:start position:0%
come to the board first
 
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
secondly who gets that information to
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
the board because it may be very
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
different in different organizations
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
third how the board is going to
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
investigate so I think number five
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
actually is a subset of number three is
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
does the board need
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
um a professional structure to do that
 
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:05.870 align:start position:0%
um a professional structure to do that
with

01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
and then finally at what level is
 
01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:11.209 align:start position:0%
and then finally at what level is
um

01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
an event reported to the problem an
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
event and an outcome reported to the
 
01:21:16.739 --> 01:21:19.070 align:start position:0%
event and an outcome reported to the
public

01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
um so that that doesn't get us any
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
farther forward making actual decisions
 
01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.850 align:start position:0%
farther forward making actual decisions
about

01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
where we're going to set those bars but
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a framework to work in
 
01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
attorney Esther Hutch you had your name
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
hand up yes uh yes Mr thank you for
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
recognizing me I know we didn't get too
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
much into the Weeds about how oplc
 
01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
functions and operates in this committee
 
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
but I I want to remind everyone that the
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee that came about because of SB
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
330 has also been meeting and in that
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
there were recommendations I haven't
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
seen any lsrs I haven't seen any written
 
01:21:59.450 --> 01:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
language drafted language yet but there
 
01:22:00.970 --> 01:22:00.980 align:start position:0%
were recommendations
 
01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:02.709 align:start position:0%
were recommendations
around

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
the authority in regards of who has the
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility between oplc and the
 
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
boards as to who should be investigating
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
claims from the public so that is a
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
thing that the SB 330 subcommittee is
 
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
also taking a look at right now and then
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
the last paragraph As far as the the
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
funding piece uh I didn't come prepared
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
to speak on funding and I'm not an
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
expert but I I do have a a general sense
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
of how things work but the boards don't
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
receive individual funding oplc does not
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
receive funding from the general funds
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
we oversee 54 boards and the
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
administrative services that we provide
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
um pursuant to 310 A1 and the rest of it
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
come about due to the licensing fees and
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
oplc has the fee setting Authority for
 
01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
the boards and that is also something
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
that the SB 330 subcommittee is taking a
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
hard look at right now so I just before
 
01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
we get too far in the investigation
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
piece the funding piece I wanted to make
 
01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
the the subcommittee here today aware of
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
sort of what's going on with 330 and how
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
in a general sense oplc is funded and
 
01:23:18.719 --> 01:23:20.090 align:start position:0%
in a general sense oplc is funded and
operates

01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
operates
 
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
the chair wonders if anyone on the
 
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
committee has done a comparison to how
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
this very issue is handled in other
 
01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:32.870 align:start position:0%
this very issue is handled in other
states

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
a wheel inventing can be made easier
 
01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
that representative Pearson yes
 
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I feel obligated to answer that
 
01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
because I want to uh OLS and got all
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
that research and got the digital copies
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
made and distributed the digital copies
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and I I did not keep reading through
 
01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:56.060 align:start position:0%
them to do my own compare and contrast
 
01:23:59.450 --> 01:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
but as you may recall from when I
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
introduced that digital copy it was said
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
to me by the person who did the research
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
that his perception was that that Maine
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
looked like they were kind of an they
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
were an exemplary State and and I I I
 
01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
must admit that I've not dug into that
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
statement any further than that
 
01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:29.630 align:start position:0%
statement any further than that
okay

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
James Potter from the New Hampshire
 
01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
Medical Society
 
01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
former second string quarterback at the
 
01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
it is college football season we got to
 
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
give you your shout out the Patriots are
 
01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:51.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
if you would be so kind as to turn your
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
mic on please thank you thank you Mr
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I appreciate that but I
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
think uh Bailey as happy is doing a
 
01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
crippled job for the Patriots right now
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
coming off the bench but thank you for
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Jim Potter I Am
 
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
The Executive Vice President and CEO of
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Medical Society so I
 
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
wanted we were actually planning to
 
01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
testify on your hearing on the 31st when
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of hearing or taking up is you
 
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
may not meeting on the 31st and I do
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
apologize I've been out last couple
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
weeks on a personal matter out of town
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
so I knew I wasn't going to be able to
 
01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
have written testimony in specific
 
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
testimony for you but I can draw to a
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
couple points if if I could from the
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
discussion today by the way I think both
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
are ourselves and I think the hospital
 
01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
Association was uh intending to testify
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
on the 31st the hospital Association is
 
01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
actually at its annual meeting today so
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
they're kind of precluded from from
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
testifying today number one
 
01:25:59.699 --> 01:26:00.350 align:start position:0%
testifying today number one
um

01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
I think what representative Murphy
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
and representative whoever had good
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
ideas with the proposal that you put
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
forth uh representative Subway I
 
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate this but um I I would take I
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
would have the hospital Association
 
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
closely review this and I'd like
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
representative whoever's idea to pose
 
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
this to them in a series of questions
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
um to my my general knowledge current
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
statutes already require hospitals to
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
report actions taken by uh taken against
 
01:26:37.729 --> 01:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
Physicians to the Board of Medicine and
 
01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:39.860 align:start position:0%
then the Board of Medicine investigates
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
so that's just one clarification but I I
 
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
think taking your proposal you will
 
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
probably learn that many of the things
 
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
that you're proposing are already in
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
policy for the hospital Association but
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
they can clarify most the best and I
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
don't want to yeah point before you go
 
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
um sir hospitals are required for are
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
certain actions to be reported to the
 
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
bom can that be blocked in other words
 
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
can the appropriate reporting Committee
 
01:27:09.729 --> 01:27:09.739 align:start position:0%
in the hospital
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
decide that well this doesn't really
 
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't get reported but
 
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
several physicians in the hospital
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps might be saying oh yes it does
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
so does this block it out or may those
 
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
physicians in their own person
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
report uh thank you for the question I
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
think it's a great question I'm not sure
 
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
what the standard is but I'm sure that
 
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
the hospital associate can tell you
 
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
specifically what that standard is that
 
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:43.139 align:start position:0%
would require reporting so I think it's
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
important you talk to them bring that
 
01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:47.169 align:start position:0%
important you talk to them bring that
forward

01:27:47.169 --> 01:27:47.179 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
a second I think there's a
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
a general misunderstandings and uh
 
01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
incorrect inferences about the Board of
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
Medicine and how volunteer it is
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
um as I kind of heard uh attorney Heinz
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned she talked about a process
 
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
that works for attorneys generally as I
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
heard it I said that's the same exact
 
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
process or very close to it that's taken
 
01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:21.139 align:start position:0%
on by professional staff through oplc
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
that includes you know a a physician
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
investigator that includes investigators
 
01:28:30.370 --> 01:28:30.380 align:start position:0%
that includes a medical review
 
01:28:34.129 --> 01:28:34.139 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and so now you're not alone
 
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
nor is anybody else on the throne about
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know looking at the board of
 
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
medicines processes
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'm fairly new here I've been here seven
 
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
years but when I witnessed early on in
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
my tenure here was
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
Physicians free freezing up when they
 
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
got that letter from the Board of
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
Medicine literally freezing themselves
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
out of the first couple steps of the
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
process and so having to go to an
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
automatic full review hearing by the
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
entire Ward which is was very lengthy
 
01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:12.260 align:start position:0%
and that concerned me
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important to clarify
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
here that when Physicians get this
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
letter this is one of the most
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
traumatizing things that they'll go
 
01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:26.420 align:start position:0%
through albeit losing a patient
 
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
you know so I realized that and we saw
 
01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
some some funding to try to clarify that
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
through the Federation and State Medical
 
01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:40.139 align:start position:0%
boards they turned down our fundering
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
question that I went back to our
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
foundation and said would you fund a
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
continuing medical education project
 
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
that goes and teaches Physicians
 
01:29:54.169 --> 01:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
very much about this process and I'm
 
01:29:57.410 --> 01:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
pleased to tell you that that is
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
actually coming to four
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
um it was supposed to start at our our
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
annual meeting at the end of this month
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
but because of the notoriety of the the
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
case that was in the newspapers we've
 
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
had several medical staff say can you
 
01:30:14.689 --> 01:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
can we already get this and so we're
 
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
doing it early I think we have at least
 
01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
a couple before uh the next couple weeks
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we're coming in so this is a hour
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
and a half program that goes in and
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
talks about you know essentially the
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
investigative process the complaint the
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process to really help so
 
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
we're committed to that kind of
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
transparency because a lot of people and
 
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
I heard a lot of testimony today that
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
confirmed that you know a lot of people
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
really don't know about those processes
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
and so we think that's an important
 
01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:47.270 align:start position:0%
and so we think that's an important
thing

01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:30:50.689 --> 01:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
um to move forward and at some point if
 
01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
this group or anybody else wants to to
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
hear you know to see this you can come
 
01:30:57.649 --> 01:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
to our annual meeting uh I'll give you
 
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
all free passes to that uh to hear that
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
um that that discussion
 
01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:06.780 align:start position:0%
um uh the uh other thing I want to make
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
and this would preview our testimony on
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
the 31st is that we will be giving
 
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
testimony that no England uh State Board
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
of Medicine reports much of what the
 
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's bar
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
um uh testified to today such as
 
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
complaints file the legend malpractice
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
in accord complaints filed with the
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine that do not result in
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
um and then the results of number two uh
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
that I just mentioned so again I think
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's what we'd be focusing on a little
 
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and again I it's it's my fault that I
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for the last couple of these
 
01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
meetings but that's what we would focus
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
on the 31st and I think the the hospital
 
01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
Association could focus on uh if if
 
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
you're willing focus on probably give
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
you some very in-depth information on on
 
01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
what you put forth to representative
 
01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:01.490 align:start position:0%
what you put forth to representative
Solway

01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
Solway
 
01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
which I hope that's that's somewhat
 
01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:06.169 align:start position:0%
which I hope that's that's somewhat
helpful

01:32:06.169 --> 01:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
any questions from Mr Prada when when is
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
your meeting I go to a lot of medical
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
meetings but when is yours ours is uh
 
01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
that previous weekend uh the 28th 29th
 
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
and 30th
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
um okay uh but if you'd like to
 
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
um but we could also arrange that we
 
01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
could we could do something for you that
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
you know if you wanted to do this in a
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
zoom call or something like this but I
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
think because of this issue I think it's
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
important for individuals to kind of
 
01:32:37.129 --> 01:32:37.139 align:start position:0%
understand the process and not make
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
inferences or assumptions about it is I
 
01:32:42.129 --> 01:32:42.139 align:start position:0%
heard a lot going on today
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:46.250 align:start position:0%
any questions
tomorrow

01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
none thank you so much thank you very
 
01:32:47.940 --> 01:33:18.350 align:start position:0%
none thank you so much thank you very
much

01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.649 --> 01:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
Mr or doctor or attorney or
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
doctor okay
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
come on up
 
01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
speaker run
 
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
yeah all right very primitive yeah David
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
Wagner I'm at it I've been a physician
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
in the state for 40 years now
 
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
so a little closer to the mic for those
 
01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:49.139 align:start position:0%
whose ears are old
 
01:33:49.139 --> 01:33:50.149 align:start position:0%
whose ears are old
um

01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
I wasn't planning on testifying today
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
but you seem to have some confusion here
 
01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:55.139 align:start position:0%
about what
 
01:33:57.410 --> 01:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
um hospitals need to report
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine
 
01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and the proposal that you were the
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
guys have been talking about there is an
 
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
RSA 151 6. B
 
01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh on the books already which pretty
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
clearly delineates the hospital's
 
01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:14.750 align:start position:0%
clearly delineates the hospital's
responsibilities

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's basically reporting of
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
this party action every facility
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
administrator or does it me or any other
 
01:34:23.209 --> 01:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
health care facility places into this
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
chapter shall report to the Board of
 
01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.270 align:start position:0%
chapter shall report to the Board of
Medicine

01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
any disciplinary action or adverse
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
um there's another doctor that I have my
 
01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
hands here that's from the Board of
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
Medicine website that has guidelines for
 
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
Hospital reporting and this was
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
um that's right on the website
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine website and it
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
basically is a summary of what should be
 
01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
reported and what should not be reported
 
01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
and it goes into a fair amount of detail
 
01:34:59.649 --> 01:34:59.659 align:start position:0%
and it kind of goes over what's uh
 
01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
what um at what level Things become
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
reportable to the Board of Medicine and
 
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
what isn't
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
is at least who this was this was
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
published by an approved by the Board of
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
Medicine on August 7 2002. let me
 
01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:18.179 align:start position:0%
re-clarify my question you gave us what
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
may be reported does it say who may
 
01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:23.930 align:start position:0%
may be reported does it say who may
report

01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
every facility administrator or designee
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
for any health care facility
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
shell report
 
01:35:33.729 --> 01:35:33.739 align:start position:0%
it gives no statue
 
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
no privileges to General citizens or no
 
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
just as it needs to be reported
 
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
these are must reports this is the
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
hospital must report the following thank
 
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
you all right and perhaps you'd like to
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
I should submit this to you the true
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and Mr chair I think
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
we looked at that statute a bit in our
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
first meeting I think we did too and
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
again we we have the issue of
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
who must and who may
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
well here we are now what guys
 
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
Where Do We Go From Here We redraft
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
well we could have a subcommittee of the
 
01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:29.810 align:start position:0%
well we could have a subcommittee of the
subcommittee

01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
we actually could have a subcommittee of
 
01:36:34.810 --> 01:36:34.820 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee to redraft
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at flow here even if we meet
 
01:36:42.610 --> 01:36:42.620 align:start position:0%
two weeks from today on October 31st
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
that will be after oversight meeting
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
which is on the 28th
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
um not come up till our November meeting
 
01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
it in the November meeting which will be
 
01:36:59.570 --> 01:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
the third Friday of November I believe
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
that may be after the LSR filing period
 
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
it starts I believe the deadline the
 
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
last day is the 22nd oh
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
of November but I haven't checked the
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
calendar to be sure so so on this issue
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
we could have a
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the subcommittee to come
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
up with
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
the second iteration of the
 
01:37:40.729 --> 01:37:40.739 align:start position:0%
recommendation based on what we've heard
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
and we could look on that on the 31st
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
and it would go to oversight on whatever
 
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
the third Friday of November is and
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
still make the deadline for an LSR I
 
01:37:56.090 --> 01:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the calendar but the
 
01:37:58.370 --> 01:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
deadline is the 22nd so it's possible
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
that it won't make the deadline too well
 
01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:04.139 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman hang on one second the third
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
Friday of November is the 18th okay then
 
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
you then you're golden the other thing
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
to remember is of course that it's it's
 
01:38:17.209 --> 01:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
not a it's not a committee that files an
 
01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
lrsr it's individual legislators so but
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
I suspect the sponsor and many if not
 
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
all of the co-sponsors would be us and
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
it would be we excuse me um and uh
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
also members of oversight
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would point out that if we
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
follow the advice of Representative
 
01:38:46.090 --> 01:38:46.100 align:start position:0%
Weber and we remove from the draft
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
verbiage regarding an LSR
 
01:38:53.689 --> 01:38:53.699 align:start position:0%
but pose this as a proposal for
 
01:38:53.699 --> 01:38:55.370 align:start position:0%
but pose this as a proposal for
consideration

01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
on the part of the oversight committee
 
01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:01.820 align:start position:0%
that it would have and if we're
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
modest in our goals
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
that we would have a reasonable chance
 
01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
of passing emotion at oversight whereas
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
if we make it highly specific and use
 
01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
the language of lsrs we're going to get
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
mired as representative Weber says in
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
the weeds
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
so we can avoid the weeds and avoid
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
using Roundup at the same time it must
 
01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:31.139 align:start position:0%
be specific enough not to be mush but
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
broad enough
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
not to overdo I suspect we could rely on
 
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee of the subcommittee to
 
01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
do the draft
 
01:39:41.930 --> 01:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
representative soloway who would you
 
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:43.610 align:start position:0%
representative soloway who would you
suggest

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
I would suggest yourself sir
 
01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
I would certainly be glad to work with
 
01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:51.890 align:start position:0%
I would certainly be glad to work with
you

01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
and additional members as you choose
 
01:39:58.729 --> 01:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
well I see two people in there who have
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
doctorates neither of whom the
 
01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:02.540 align:start position:0%
doctorates are in medicine
 
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
may I may I suggest uh representative
 
01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.179 align:start position:0%
Weber as an alternative to me and the
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
reason for that is uh she and I both
 
01:40:14.209 --> 01:40:14.219 align:start position:0%
thought of the headlines uh or the
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
headings that we should use I I thought
 
01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
hers were more complete and I like her
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
idea of posing questions so she's got an
 
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
are you willing to serve crap
 
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.110 align:start position:0%
are you willing to serve crap
um

01:40:32.110 --> 01:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
I I have to say that right now
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
um I am dealing with
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh two family crises of The Sibling kind
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
and one family crisis of the canine kind
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
so if the question is today my answer is
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
no but certainly I would I would be glad
 
01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
to be consulted and and
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
work on that and particularly
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
if we could you know if you don't
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
appoint a subcommittee official
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that would then be subject
 
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
to the right to no long way you know we
 
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
were less than a quorum we could just
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
informally submit a draft to each other
 
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
and then bring it back to this committee
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
or wherever else anybody wants to send
 
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
it there were nine people in this
 
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
subcommittee one of whom is absent so we
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
can have four what Dr Murphy like to be
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:35.420 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is if you
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
establish a further official
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of a subcommittee of a
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee it's subject to the right
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
to no law and I'm suggesting therefore
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
we may have up to four people because
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
this is a subcommittee of nine right
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
so given the fact that uh we
 
01:42:00.770 --> 01:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
informally have a JD a demon and a PhD
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be cool to have an MD on
 
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.149 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be cool to have an MD on
this

01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:18.410 --> 01:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
everybody sneak off you have snuck off
 
01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:20.570 align:start position:0%
everybody sneak off you have snuck off
successfully

01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
now should we meet again on the 31st as
 
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
we have been advertising
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
well it sounds to me like we've got a
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
number of people who haven't commented
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
yet who are very much interested in the
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
process who we ought to hear from
 
01:42:37.570 --> 01:42:37.580 align:start position:0%
and again we've got the time
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
to take into account their comments so I
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
think it would be a better thing to
 
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
operate with more of more information
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
rather than less
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
more is better yeah okay
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
all right so we will meet again one
 
01:43:00.890 --> 01:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
o'clock Monday October 31st we hope here
 
01:43:03.609 --> 01:43:03.619 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee of Representatives
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
soloway Pearson Weber and Murphy will
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
word Smith
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
and meanwhile I will be talking with the
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and see if perhaps
 
01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
a few more of us could be invited to
 
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
that little Zoom Gathering
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
and I think that's it unless anybody
 
01:43:24.729 --> 01:43:24.739 align:start position:0%
else has anything
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
all right motion to adjourn second all
