00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
update yet
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
um she did indicate that she's expecting
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
guidance from treasury to be released on
 
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.230 align:start position:0%
guidance from treasury to be released on
monday

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
monday
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
and that she would pass that along as
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
soon as she receives it
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
and if that happens there's a
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
possibility we may be able to have a
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
virtual conversation when we meet to
 
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.150 align:start position:0%
virtual conversation when we meet to
discuss

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
so if and then after uh
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
we're through with mr brian
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
upload we will discuss some other
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
matters relative to the committee
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
brian it's always a pleasure to have you
 
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.710 align:start position:0%
brian it's always a pleasure to have you
here

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's the floor is yours thank you very
 
00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:31.990 align:start position:0%
it's the floor is yours thank you very
much

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um again thank you for the
 
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.309 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um again thank you for the
invitation

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
invitation
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
it was a little bit short notice so i
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
um kind of tailor some of my remarks
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
as much as i would like to the what i
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
think are the needs
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
of your committee but i but i did add um
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
some information i think that is of
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
interest and i know you folks had some
 
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:54.309 align:start position:0%
interest and i know you folks had some
interest

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
in the issue of ppp loans so i
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of information on that
 
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.589 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of information on that
hopefully

00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll shed a little bit of light
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
but beyond that um the overall message
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
that i'll be talking about is what's
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
happening i think in the in the new
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire economy and what it's going to
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
look like over the next couple of years
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
and in that regard it's a very different
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
outlook than i think when i spoke to you
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
in january at a joint
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
house and senate ways and means
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee at that time i was expecting
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
it to be a very difficult first half of
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
of the year
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
it did certainly start out that way the
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
first few months but
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
i think the improvements have
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
accelerated at a pace that was a little
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
bit quicker than i had anticipated
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of very positive
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
economic information
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's coming out nationally so with
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
that it has significantly upgraded my
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
outlook for the new hampshire economy so
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
with that rather long introduction
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll be able to see my screen
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
and are you seeing the first chart
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
yes we are all right perfect you know
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's always a
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
i've i've done so many different
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
platforms and zoom usually works
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
but i've done every imaginable um remote
 
00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:14.550 align:start position:0%
but i've done every imaginable um remote
platform

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
platform
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
some of them work better than others
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
this one luckily
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's going to work out so
 
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
before would you be able to email us a
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
copy of this
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely i usually i thank you
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
for reminding me i always say that
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
usually say that at the beginning
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
frequently i forget but i will make a
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
copy of this i'll send it to jennifer
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
and she can distribute it if that's okay
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
great thank you sure so um just
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
because i've got quite a few slides um
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
if i were to summarize
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
sort of the outlook this is what i would
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
say um
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
and a lot of this i i presented most
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
recently at a manchester chamber
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
economic outlook uh presentation i've
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
updated some of the charts and
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
added some additional information
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
because i only had about 20 minutes on
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
that one this one i guess i got a little
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
bit longer
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
so basically what i see
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
is that for the rest of 2021 and 2022
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to see
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
pretty significant job gains and gdp
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
growth is going to really accelerate
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
and our unemployment will fall quickly
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
we had really good
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
job numbers nationally in
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
march i think the april numbers will
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
show that
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
as well so we're going to see um
 
00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
as well so we're going to see um
reemployment

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
reemployment
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
kicking kicking up pretty rapidly
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
yep would you take questions as you're
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
going along
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
oh sure sure it'll be it will be hard
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
for me to
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
because i the way the screen is um
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna have to just interrupt
 
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:51.829 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna have to just interrupt
me

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
um if you want um to because i
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know i talk a lot and i talk fast so
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
whoever wants to ask a question is i
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
won't be able to see them
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
um so if you can recognize them that
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
um so it's not just a hospitality
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
industry you know they suffered
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
in retail but at least in new hampshire
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
and nationally in new hampshire 80
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
percent of the industries
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
in the last monthly report had added
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
jobs so it's pretty the gains in the
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
re-employment gains are
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
really broad-based and that's an
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
excellent sign we expected that
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
that hospitality industry would pick up
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
as the weather improved
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
as as vaccines rates increased
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
but it's really almost across the board
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
um and particularly in some of the
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
industries that have been hardest hit
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturing nationally is booming um
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i believe won't be very
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
far behind there's a couple of
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
industries that i think are going to
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
really do well the computer and
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
electronics and that's
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
led just one example ba systems
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
they have a big portion of the
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
f-35 fighter jet
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
and they make a large percentage of the
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
components in that airplane
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
and it was just a new contract um issued
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
for that so
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
i expect that they'll you know they'll
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
benefit from that as will some other
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
aerospace related manufacturing and our
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
medical manufacturing
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
is you know you've seen it in that in
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
some of the headlines and some of the
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
newspaper reports
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
companies that have announced expansions
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
or locations in new hampshire and
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
you know i've i've prepared a couple of
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
labor market analysis for those
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
companies so
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
um those are just two examples of i
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
think where
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
um the manufacturing sector is is really
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
even during the pandemic was doing
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
but um are really poised to lead the
 
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.230 align:start position:0%
but um are really poised to lead the
growth

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
growth
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
this la this next one the favorable
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
demographics i know there was a report
 
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.590 align:start position:0%
demographics i know there was a report
yesterday

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
about you know the slow population
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
growth and
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
not unexpected um over the last
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh decade it's been slower
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
but our demographics and this is one of
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
the ironies or one of the
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
i hate to say there's any advantage to
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic but as i will show you
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
it has made new hampshire relatively
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
more attractive
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know there was a story in the
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
new york times i think about
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
areas rural areas in the country that
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
were attracting
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
the most residents from other states and
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
lebanon new hampshire happen to be one
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
but throughout new hampshire we're
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
seeing an increase in interest and i'll
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about that and
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
that's been our biggest challenge
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
really is demographics and with the
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
increased migration that i expect
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
it will help us address some of those um
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
this is related
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
we have the fourth highest home
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
appreciation in the nation now that's a
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
a benefit if you own a home it's a
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
negative and your wealth
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's a negative if you're looking to buy
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
and we do have housing cost issues um
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
but you know again it speaks to the
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
attractiveness of the state and one of
 
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:10.949 align:start position:0%
attractiveness of the state and one of
those

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
you know i have to be honest and i'm not
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
a not an overtly political person but
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know the things that i see and the
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
things that i hear
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
about why people are interested is
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
obviously a great state with a lot of
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities but it also does offer an
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
advantage in terms of the tax burden
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
which does help attract and retain
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
working-age residents
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
um again not a political person so
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
whether you like this
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know american rescue plan or not um
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
it will provide stimulus to the to the
 
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.030 align:start position:0%
it will provide stimulus to the to the
economy

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
economy
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
those stimulus impacts really didn't
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
show up much
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the march employment economic numbers
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
but we're going to start seeing it
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
beginning this month when you know early
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
next month when the april numbers
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
show up and again the supporting
 
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.470 align:start position:0%
show up and again the supporting
environment

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of infrastructure plan and i'm
 
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:05.750 align:start position:0%
some sort of infrastructure plan and i'm
not

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
commenting on whether you know this one
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
that's proposed by
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
by the administration is necessarily the
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
best or the worst
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
but there's going to be some sort of
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
in infrastructure investment it's needed
 
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.590 align:start position:0%
in infrastructure investment it's needed
because

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
we've under-invested and that will
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
provide additional boost to economic
 
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.069 align:start position:0%
provide additional boost to economic
activity

00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
both in the short term and longer term
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
because i think um depending on how that
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
money is spent
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
it can help increase productivity and
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
lower business costs so
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the overall um generic
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
outlook or the the you know to set the
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
stage and i'll get into some
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
more specifics now um what i thought i'd
 
00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:45.590 align:start position:0%
more specifics now um what i thought i'd
do

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
is kind of take it take us a little bit
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
through where
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
we're coming from this is employment
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire non-farm
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
total employment in new hampshire prior
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic and you see it was
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
increasing pretty steadily during the
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
last recession it dropped
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a drop at the very end
 
00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:09.590 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a drop at the very end
there

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
i had forecast prior to the pandemic
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire would see
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
employment growth of about just under
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
one percent in 2020 and 1.2
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
in 2021 well that sort of
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
went out the window with the pandemic
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
and this is what happened
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
you see that red line which is just a
 
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.310 align:start position:0%
you see that red line which is just a
dramatic

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
dramatic
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
drop in employment you know over a
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh people um were unemployed
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
either collecting unemployment benefits
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
or or lost jobs
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
and we bounced back pretty significantly
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
it was sort of looking like a
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
more of a v-shaped recovery but then
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
that second wave of the pandemic hit
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
and you saw see a drop there in the that
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
began in the fall of 2020
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
and we've recovered again from that and
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
and job growth is picking up and
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit later i'll show you what my
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
forecast is and how it relates to that
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is we still have a
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
ways to go yes
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
bob i think you're muted you're muted
 
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.630 align:start position:0%
bob i think you're muted you're muted
bob

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
bob
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
there you go go ahead yeah brian i want
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
to go back to
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
your first point which ties into this
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
one what what
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
is the present uh unemployment rate
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire yeah now i actually
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
have a chart on that
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to explain a little bit
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
about it and i
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
i'm jumping ahead here um it is three
 
00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:50.310 align:start position:0%
i'm jumping ahead here um it is three
percent

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
officially now the official unemployment
 
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.029 align:start position:0%
officially now the official unemployment
rate

00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
um only from my perspective doesn't
 
00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.669 align:start position:0%
um only from my perspective doesn't
really

00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
accurately reflect where we are
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you vermont has the lowest
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
or one of the lowest unemployment 2.9
 
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
or one of the lowest unemployment 2.9
percent

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
i don't believe vermont's economy is a
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
2.9 percent on unemployment rate economy
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
we are at three percent but that only
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
includes about
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
half the people who are collecting
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
the bureau of labor statistics has
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
calculated unemployment rates based on
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
people who lost their job either
 
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.430 align:start position:0%
people who lost their job either
temporarily

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
from for a layoff or permanently those
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
are the people who are and
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
who want work so those are the people
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
who are officially counted as
 
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.470 align:start position:0%
who are officially counted as
unemployment

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic what happened as
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
was a couple of federal programs were
 
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
was a couple of federal programs were
created

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
pandemic unemployment assistance which
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
allowed people
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
who couldn't work for various reasons
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
related to the pandemic either they had
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
child care issues etc a number of issues
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
to they were allowed to collect
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
so that's different than the historical
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
way the bureau
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
counts unemployment so from the bureau
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
of labor statistics perspective they
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to change the definition
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
for the official unemployment rate just
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic which we thought
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
was going to be a few months
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
so they continue to calculate their rate
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
only using people who meet the original
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
definition of unemployment they do not
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
count in
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
the people who are able to collect the
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
benefits because their hours were cut
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
because they were self-employed
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
because they had child care issues or
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
they had health issues
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
so when you factor those people into the
 
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.070 align:start position:0%
so when you factor those people into the
rate

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
our rate is almost double it's about six
 
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.909 align:start position:0%
our rate is almost double it's about six
percent

00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
um and that's true of most states so
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
um you know it's very hard for me to say
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a three percent
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
when i know there's still over 30 000
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
people collecting
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits thanks for the
 
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:06.950 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits thanks for the
explanation

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
all right so this is again where we
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
where we are and we've got a long you
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
know we've got a ways to go to get back
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
all of the jobs you know we're starting
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
i think for the remainder of the year
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
we may have a month where it's not so
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
great but i think we're gonna
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're gonna you know add there's a i
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't know of a business that isn't
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
looking to hire people
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna add jobs big part will be
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
getting people
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
back into the labor force but it's going
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
to take a while it'll be 2022 before
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
you know probably mid late 2022 before
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
we even get back to where we were
 
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.909 align:start position:0%
we even get back to where we were
pre-pandemic

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
and this chart just shows what's
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
happened to the labor force
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have stepped out of
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
labor force um
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know because of the pandemic some
 
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.750 align:start position:0%
you know because of the pandemic some
people

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
had health issues i'll tell you there
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
was a large
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
a fairly large segment of across the
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
country uh of um you know
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
older workers who decided well uh this
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
may be the time to start collecting
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
social security
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
um there was a big increase in social
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
security applications for social
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
security benefits i don't have that data
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
specifically to new hampshire
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
so people at the older end of the
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
of their working lives stepped out we
 
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
had a lot of
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
women in particular who stepped out of
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
the labor force
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
because they tend to be primary
 
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.789 align:start position:0%
because they tend to be primary
caregivers

00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
caregivers
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
so when schools were closed and
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
there were fewer options for child care
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
or child supervision
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of women stepped out of labor
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
force so getting people back
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
into the labor force is going to be
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
really really critical
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
for my forecast to work and for us to
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
add the jobs that i think
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
potentially we could add we we are
 
00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:54.390 align:start position:0%
potentially we could add we we are
seeing

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
a strong demand for labor um but
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's not being as filled as quickly
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
and some of that can be helped by
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
schools being back in in you know
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
in-person learning child care will be a
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
big part of it getting more child care
 
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.830 align:start position:0%
big part of it getting more child care
uh

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
facilities opened and at full staff a
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
lot of pieces to get people back into
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
the labor force vaccine
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
is going to help you have a question uh
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative sellsworth sure thank you
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's exactly what you're talking about
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
i live in the seacoast and as each week
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
goes by
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
employers getting more and more
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
desperate they're even wondering to what
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
extent they can
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
open and i'm not sure there actually is
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
going to be a solution for this summer
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
um it just seems like the list of jobs
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the lack of housing really are not
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
something that can be solved quickly
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah the the the there's plenty of jobs
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
out there um you know there are
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
i mean the lack of workers i misspoke
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
yeah the lack of workers
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
well you know here's the thing is that
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
we still have 30 000 people collecting
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits and i know i was
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
quoted i live in the seacoast
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
also representative southworth and you
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
know i was quoted in the
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the dover the fosters
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
related to the hospitality industry a
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
lot of restaurants have openings
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know in dover this past weekend i
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to do takeout and i found three
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
restaurants that i
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to get take out from are no
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
longer doing takeout because
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
they're concentrating they don't have
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
the staff and they're concentrating
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
on the in-person dining so um but yep
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
we have 3 800 people collecting
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
in that industry so um you know we we're
 
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.590 align:start position:0%
in that industry so um you know we we're
starting

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
starting
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
up the work search requirement again
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
which had been suspended
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know people and rightly so during
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic it was
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
very difficult for people to go out and
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
search for work
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
businesses were open they weren't you
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
know in they didn't
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
allow in-person interview whatever so
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
that was suspended but now
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh beginning in may may 23rd individuals
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
who are collecting unemployment benefits
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
are going to have to certify that they
 
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.350 align:start position:0%
are going to have to certify that they
have

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
actually you know looked for work and if
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
they were offered
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
enough uh a position um you know they're
 
00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:18.789 align:start position:0%
enough uh a position um you know they're
expected

00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
expected
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
to to take it if it's an equivalent
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
position so
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
um i think that will help um i think i'm
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
not starting
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
yep i'm sorry when is that starting
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh may 23rd okay
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and that was um at the at the
 
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:35.909 align:start position:0%
yeah and that was um at the at the
governor's

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
um uh i think executive order
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
um you know the i think in most states
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
or a lot of states that suspended their
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
work requirements as well
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
so we weren't unusual in that
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative has a question
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
sure yeah thank you for taking my
 
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.029 align:start position:0%
sure yeah thank you for taking my
question

00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
um i understand how that would work with
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
something like
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
the food service or hospitality or even
 
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.630 align:start position:0%
the food service or hospitality or even
manufacturing

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
where some a person with a skill could
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
go out and do it
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
but what about the individuals that are
 
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:07.990 align:start position:0%
but what about the individuals that are
relying

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
relying
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
upon government to take place for
 
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.070 align:start position:0%
upon government to take place for
example

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the courts are closed
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
those people that work for the court um
 
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.470 align:start position:0%
those people that work for the court um
lawyer

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
well yeah two degree lawyers
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
their uh private secretaries are per or
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
company secretaries
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
they can't just go out and find work on
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
how's it going how are you going to be
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
able to look for work
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
if your work has been closed by the
 
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.830 align:start position:0%
if your work has been closed by the
government

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i mean i'm not sure that we've
 
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.029 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i mean i'm not sure that we've
got

00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh governments uh you know i'm not sure
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
how what is closed anymore
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
um from my perspective pretty much all
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know there there aren't any
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions on
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
on um i you know there are there are
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
every almost everything is going to be
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
open very soon courts are getting back
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
into um and i only know this because i
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
happen to know somebody who works
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
in the in the judicial system um they're
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to be going back to having trials
 
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.070 align:start position:0%
going to be going back to having trials
etc

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
they've been doing work um
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know if they haven't been having
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
in-person trials they've been doing work
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
there aren't in the private sector i'm
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
not sure there
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
are any restrictions anymore other than
 
00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.789 align:start position:0%
are any restrictions anymore other than
voluntary

00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
um if i could interrupt in the banking
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
um you're limited to the number of
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
people you can have in the lobby
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
you're limited uh by uh dictate
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
as to uh foreclosure processes
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
or or renewing or
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
developing your your banking trade by
 
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.549 align:start position:0%
developing your your banking trade by
dictate

00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
dictate
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh where does that leave uh a chunk of
 
00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
uh where does that leave uh a chunk of
people

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
well actually in the fi in the finance
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
industry they we've added jobs so i
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a much of a
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know more of that's been online um
 
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.310 align:start position:0%
you know more of that's been online um
so

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know when i look at the numbers in
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
terms of of jobs and people filing for
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
unemployment there really isn't
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't seem to be an issue in
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
that particular industry
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to suggest that if you
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
can't go into the lobby
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't create inconvenience for
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
some people but just
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
in looking at the data um you know
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
the the finance industry has
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
not really seen a shrinkage there are
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
some individual businesses that have
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
chosen to you know to close branches but
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
from my perspective that has a lot more
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
to do with what you know is happening in
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
you know in the profitability of those
 
00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:40.710 align:start position:0%
you know in the profitability of those
particular

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh locations and it does with any
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
particular restrictions but
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
um you know that's not representative
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
already that's really not my
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
um you know those decisions aren't mine
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're not my
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
organizations um and you know when you
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
the restriction i have nothing to do
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
with the restrictions
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
my organization doesn't have anything to
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
do with the restrictions on what
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
businesses can do i'm just saying from
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
my perspective
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
i thought most of what restrictions on
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
private sector activity had been removed
 
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:13.750 align:start position:0%
private sector activity had been removed
or

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
were very close to being removed by the
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
the reopening commission um i may be
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
wrong on that but i thought
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of it had had opened up
 
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.149 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of it had had opened up
again

00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
um so i may be wrong on that but um
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know i i can't debate whether it was
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
a good move or not it wasn't
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
our my decision um
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
you know whether whether you believe
 
00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:39.269 align:start position:0%
you know whether whether you believe
we're

00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
we're we have more restrictions or not i
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
you know i can't
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
i really can't speak to that although i
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
just spent five minutes speaking to it
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
um just to give you an idea of the
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
continued claims for unemployment this
 
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.269 align:start position:0%
continued claims for unemployment this
is

00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
just where you know how we compare
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
continued claims are people who on a
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
week to week basis
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
file for unemployment and we saw a
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
pretty significant drop early on
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know through the summer it picked up
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
again again
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of with the second wave
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then the winter time
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
it started to fall again but we still
 
00:29:11.679 --> 00:29:11.990 align:start position:0%
it started to fall again but we still
have

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
a ways to go we still have over 30 000
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are collecting
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
about uh about half of them
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
in what is called the regular
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance program which
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know the people who are laid off in
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
or lost their jobs
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
in sort of what we i hate to say the
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
traditional way
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
the other half is through the new
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
programs that were started the pandemic
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment assistance which allows
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
people to
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know who have been affected by the
 
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.950 align:start position:0%
you know who have been affected by the
pandemic

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know to collect benefits and that
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
includes self-employed gig workers
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
people who have child care or health
 
00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
people who have child care or health
issues

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
so we're we're making progress um i
 
00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.510 align:start position:0%
so we're we're making progress um i
think

00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
we'll see some acceleration in that
 
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.710 align:start position:0%
we'll see some acceleration in that
progress

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
progress
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
um one of the ironies and you know
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this a little bit is
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
the number of job openings during 2020
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
was actually higher
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
than the number of job openings or
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
postings in 2019
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of reasons for
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
that part of that is is that the labor
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
force shrunk so
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
people stepped out of the labor force
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
for various reasons
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
um and when it did that didn't
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
mean necessarily that the business
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have a need for
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
for a worker so a lot of a lot of
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
openings went unfulfilled
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
um in 2000 2020
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
we're seeing again even a greater pickup
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
in the number of job postings and
 
00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
in the number of job postings and
interestingly

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
you know some different categories
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
reallocation of labor you know we're
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
going to see fewer retail
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
jobs we're going to see more
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
transportation and warehousing jobs
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
some of that was happening prior to the
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic as you know brick and mortar
 
00:31:06.799 --> 00:31:08.070 align:start position:0%
pandemic as you know brick and mortar
retailing

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
retailing
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
was was suffering a bit
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
or more than a little bit because of
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
online retailing that accelerated during
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
we'll probably see fewer hospitality
 
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.870 align:start position:0%
we'll probably see fewer hospitality
restaurant

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
workers there sadly there's going to be
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
some that
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
restaurants that will not survive and
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is more
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
remote listings one of my projects is to
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
try and get a better handle on the
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
number of remote job listings
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has increased remote
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
working it means
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
that people can get jobs far away from
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
where they live
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's both a benefit and a curse to new
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'll
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about it but i
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
did a presentation to
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
to some tech industries a few weeks ago
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i looked at
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
information technology workers and the
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
number three
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
employer looking to hire workers
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire was facebook facebook
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
has no
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
no operation in new hampshire so we're
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
going to see a lot more
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
companies and we're seeing it looking to
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
grab our talent
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
we will get the people um what we've got
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
to do is
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
translate the people who are moving here
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
into into uh
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
people who are also working here um
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
i just quickly you know these are some
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
of the industries that have
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
added workers um and i look at the march
 
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.710 align:start position:0%
added workers um and i look at the march
2020

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
to 2021 time period the change march
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
2020 the data was collected just before
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
things shut down so it's a pretty good
 
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.029 align:start position:0%
things shut down so it's a pretty good
indicator

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
indicator
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
and what you see is there was a lot of
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
industries that have added workers
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
over the year what isn't shown here is
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
the ones that lost and the ones that
 
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.310 align:start position:0%
the ones that lost and the ones that
lost

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
personal services you know the kinds of
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
high contact
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
interactions that require interactions
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
interpersonal interactions
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
so retailing loss you know hospitality
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
restaurants loss not
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
not the limited services restaurants
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
which i put up here
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
those are like the fast food and the
 
00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:12.710 align:start position:0%
those are like the fast food and the
takeout

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
takeout
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
through the drive-thru uh made it you
 
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:15.990 align:start position:0%
through the drive-thru uh made it you
know

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
and one of the few alternatives during
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
the peak of the pandemic where you could
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
you know you could
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
purchase um food away from home so a lot
 
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.110 align:start position:0%
purchase um food away from home so a lot
of

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of industries did add um
 
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.470 align:start position:0%
a lot of industries did add um
unfortunately

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
there were several industries that lost
 
00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:31.509 align:start position:0%
there were several industries that lost
big

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
numbers um and hospitality is is the one
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
that really jumps out
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
um also
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
surprisingly healthcare you know
 
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.110 align:start position:0%
surprisingly healthcare you know
hospitals

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
and other health care providers stopped
 
00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:46.870 align:start position:0%
and other health care providers stopped
providing

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
discretionary or non-emergency services
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
so we saw a big decline in in
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
employment in health care and that's
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
picked up um since but still is
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
is down a little bit
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
this is uh just i just wanted to point
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
this out because it
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
it you know it's both good and bad um it
 
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.230 align:start position:0%
it you know it's both good and bad um it
shows

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
shows
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
um and this is data that's not survey
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
data it's actually census
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
of our employers which occurs on a
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
and we're just about finished with the
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter but
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
third quarter was a peak you know peak
 
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic and it shows
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
um what the wages
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
of industries that lost jobs and this is
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
a weighted average so it takes the
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
number of people who lost jobs in those
 
00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:36.629 align:start position:0%
number of people who lost jobs in those
industries

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
industries
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
versus the ones that gained and what
 
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.750 align:start position:0%
versus the ones that gained and what
their

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
wages are the average weighted average
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
and what it shows is that the jobs that
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
were lost were lower paying and that's
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know i don't mean to suggest that
 
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:49.909 align:start position:0%
you know i don't mean to suggest that
those

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's you know that makes it any better
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
because that's
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
especially uh problematic because
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
individuals who are lower wage tend to
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
be lower skill
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
and have fewer opportunities to find
 
00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:02.470 align:start position:0%
and have fewer opportunities to find
other

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
employment or re-employment but the
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
industries that added jobs
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
tended to be you know well-paying
 
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.990 align:start position:0%
tended to be you know well-paying
industries

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
industries
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of professional services a
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
lot of technology
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
related employment saw pretty
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
significant gains and i just
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know take a look at i highlighted a
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
few of these
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
that are well paying industries
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
and the percentage increase in
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
employment over that same time period
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
so you know scientific research and
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
development services isn't a
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
big employer in the state but it's
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
growing and it grew during the pandemic
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
financial investment
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
computers you know a lot of well-paying
 
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.790 align:start position:0%
computers you know a lot of well-paying
industries

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
industries
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
and what's characteristic of these
 
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.630 align:start position:0%
and what's characteristic of these
industries

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
industries
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
they can make people could work from
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
home and that's the real difference
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know those lower wage jobs that were
 
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:56.870 align:start position:0%
you know those lower wage jobs that were
lost

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
most of them almost all of them were in
 
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
industries that required a high degree
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
of personal contact
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
if it was personal services you know you
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
think hair dressers
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
nail salons and you know all kinds of
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
activities like that or retail
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
or hospitality high person contact these
 
00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.910 align:start position:0%
or hospitality high person contact these
jobs

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
that were added allowed businesses to
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
continue the operation because a lot of
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
people could work from home
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
i one of the things that i've done and a
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
lot of economists have done during the
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic is look to private sector
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
data sources um you know the bureau of
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
labor statistics provides a lot of my
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
organizations funding because we
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
partner with them to collect employment
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
and unemployment data and labor force
 
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.390 align:start position:0%
and unemployment data and labor force
data

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
but one of the challenges is that data
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
is collected and reported with a pretty
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
significant lag at least
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know six months or six weeks beyond
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
when it was collected so
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
i've really struggled during the
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic and a lot of people have to try
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
and get more timely information and the
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
private sector has offered
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of different a lot of sources have
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
stepped up
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
and this is one of them and it's a
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
company called wompley that
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
provides transactional services
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
for small businesses and they define
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
businesses a business as being closed
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
as one that didn't have a financial
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
transaction a credit card transaction
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
um over a three-day period so if it goes
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
three days without a transaction it's
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
considered close
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
so it may open up again later but they
 
00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.150 align:start position:0%
so it may open up again later but they
do

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
report this data and they this chart
 
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
report this data and they this chart
shows

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
shows
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
compared to the pre-pandemic number of
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
businesses that were closed
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
what percentage are considered closed
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic and what you see
 
00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic and what you see
is

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
during the worst of it in april when
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
things were really shut down and
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
many many businesses were not allowed to
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
operate many industries
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
almost half of the small businesses
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
didn't have a financial transaction over
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
three weeks
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
now that has improved but we're still at
 
00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:16.230 align:start position:0%
now that has improved but we're still at
about

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
15 to 20 percent um
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
if you average it out of small
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
businesses that
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
would be considered remain closed and
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
they tend to be the smallest of
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
of small businesses so that's you know
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
that's a problem
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i said a long time ago early on in
 
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:33.829 align:start position:0%
and i said a long time ago early on in
this

00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic that i expected that probably
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
as many as 15 percent of the
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
small businesses might not survive
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
um the the the longer it goes and
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
we know it's gone very long and
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's some
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
there's some geographic aspects to this
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
too i'm you know
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think this plays into some of the the
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know the rural
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
more urban discrepancies because
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
just you know one example if a
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant closes in downtown portsmouth
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
there will be another restaurant to open
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
up there in not too long
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
because that place gets visitors all the
 
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.109 align:start position:0%
because that place gets visitors all the
time

00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
but you know if a restaurant closes in a
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
community in the north country
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the same demographics
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the same visitors
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
it may not be replaced so you know i
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
fear that there could be some
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
um you know some exacerbation of the
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
of the rural urban north south uh
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
um you know problems as a result of the
 
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.310 align:start position:0%
um you know problems as a result of the
pandemic

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
ryan we have a question from
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative on that
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
sure i'm brian
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
could you tell us what how you define a
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
small business
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
the feds say 500 workers and that's all
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much yeah it's it's all of
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
but you know but
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh probably a few dozen in new
 
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
uh uh probably a few dozen in new
hampshire

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah i you know i have a very hard
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
time with the 500
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
definition when i think of a small
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
business i think of 50 and under
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know something like that um along
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
that lines and
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
and you know you know we just we just
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't fit our um
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't fit our economy and
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fit many states economy
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh to suggest you know it to put a
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
business of 500 on the same plane as
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a local retailer you know small
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
or a restaurant just
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
to me doesn't make a lot of sense i i'm
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how that came about my
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
guess is you know
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
if you're the small business
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
administration that gives you a much
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
larger clientele
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
and a much larger you know number of
 
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.030 align:start position:0%
and a much larger you know number of
businesses

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
which you can do you know uh do business
 
00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.870 align:start position:0%
which you can do you know uh do business
with

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
but it to me it doesn't make a lot of
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
sense um i
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
i've looked at in the past that how they
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
came up with that
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't figure out what the
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
rationale is it's not what most people
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
think of as a small business
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
brian representative tucker has a
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
question too yeah
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's three days that womp yeah just
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and the second thing i
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
i throw out is the
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
50 is where the family and medical
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
leave kicks in
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
so that may be a small business
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
number that's easier to track because
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
right they have to conform and so there
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
should be statistics
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
which i think would be more useful in
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
right oh yes no doubt about it i mean
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know i don't have enough the top of
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
my head but we do know how many
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
businesses with employees that we have
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
at those different break points and i do
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
you know i do know
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
up to 49 i don't have it off the top of
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
my head but i do know how many
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
businesses we have
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire at that number and how
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
many people they employ
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know we do keep that kind of data so
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
where where would i be able to find that
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
if i wanted a good question
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
i would love to well that's another
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
thing on my agenda we have
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of good information we present it
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
horribly on our website
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
so i can't even i can't off the top of
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
my head
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's because i haven't been
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
here long enough but i will get you that
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
information i think that it's very very
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
useful for ways and means
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah no doubt about it we have a
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
really a lot of good information it's
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
just not all that accessible and that's
 
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.030 align:start position:0%
just not all that accessible and that's
not

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know unique to to new hampshire
 
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.150 align:start position:0%
you know unique to to new hampshire
government

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's you know i'm i the worst
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
from my perspective website i ever go to
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
is the census bureau
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
very hard to find easily information
 
00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.390 align:start position:0%
very hard to find easily information
there

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
um so we've got to do a better job and
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
we are actually in the process
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
of doing that we've done some good
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
things with in my operation
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
granite stats which is a very user
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
friendly with an easy interface
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
that allows you to get information
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
employment income
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
on at the community level the county
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
level the regional planning level
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
um really intuitive interface so that's
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the first step
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
and uh if you go to our our uh
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
you know the elmi portion of the new
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire employment security website
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
poke around with that but i think that's
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
a a really good beginning
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
oh i'll try it thank you very much yeah
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
um so oh i should go back
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
i just this is just a chart it's another
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
private sector source home base
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
um they do um you know payroll an hour
 
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know scheduling and so they do
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
the same sort of thing compared to prior
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know pre-pandemic how many you know
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
what percentage
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
of um of of businesses or the median
 
00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:00.630 align:start position:0%
of um of of businesses or the median
hours

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
how does it compare to pre-pandemic
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
levels in new hampshire we see about a
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
17. so it's very pretty consistent with
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
that whole
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
um you know 15 to 20 percent of small
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that are closed it's
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
the one thing it does show is that and i
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
added is that
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a little bit better off
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
than our you know our
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and i think that's the
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate comparison because we all
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
kind of suffered
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
the same you know um uh pandemic effects
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know we all had you know
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
kind of similar regulations and we
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
all had sort of similar outbreaks etc
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
so it's appropriate you could find you
 
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
so it's appropriate you could find you
know

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
some states out west that are much
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
better but they didn't have the same
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
impact the pandemic didn't have the same
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
kind of impact
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know so
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
we've got closures and we've got um
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
hours cut back but what
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
i look at you know i'm always trying to
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
find something positive here
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
is that um the number of
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh new business formations and this data
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
is from the irs so it's basically
 
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.349 align:start position:0%
is from the irs so it's basically
businesses

00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
that have filed for employer
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
identification numbers
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the census bureau takes that
 
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.710 align:start position:0%
and the census bureau takes that
information

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
and they divide it up into different
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
categories so you can get
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
you know a sole proprietor wanting to do
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
that you can get
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
different kinds of businesses but what
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
they do is they
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
divide it up into a couple of different
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
categories that i think are
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
are important and one of them is a high
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
propensity to hire and that's based on
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
some statistical work that
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
finds that the when um an organization
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
seeks a an employer id number
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
in that particular industry it's very
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
likely that that will turn
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
into an organization that hires
 
00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:54.230 align:start position:0%
into an organization that hires
employees

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
they also have one where not only
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
have they a high propensity to hire but
 
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.349 align:start position:0%
have they a high propensity to hire but
they've

00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
they've
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
actually gotten to the process where
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
they come to
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
an employment security agency and have
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
started a
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know an account to do to pay to do
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
payroll taxes that's a smaller number
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
and it happens a little bit later so
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lag there so i
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
focus in on this high propensity to hire
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
and what you see is there obviously was
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
a drop during you know kind of the peak
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
but it has picked up and so we're seeing
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
some creativity
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
um you know there are new opportunities
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
created in the new hampshire economy so
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
while we have lost
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
um uh and we will lose many small
 
00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:40.630 align:start position:0%
um uh and we will lose many small
businesses

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
there are a number of opportunities that
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
have been created
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and i think you know we'll see kind
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
of a burst of
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know new activity as a result and
 
00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:52.950 align:start position:0%
uh you know new activity as a result and
it

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't happen immediately but
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
definitely if you
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
trend that out some of that upswing is
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
simply the record
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know recovering the numbers but it
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
continues and i haven't
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know looked at the most this data
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
comes out on a weekly basis some of the
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
best data
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know high frequency timely data that
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
that i can get in terms of what's
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
happening with
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know interest in starting new
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
businesses in new hampshire
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the you know one of the
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
good good aspects
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
oh oh i don't know why is that i think
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
that's a repeat
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
i've done that one okay i did want to i
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
did um
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
i did want to this is kind of out of
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
place i didn't want to skip around but i
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that whole
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
notion of the official unemployment rate
 
00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:38.630 align:start position:0%
notion of the official unemployment rate
versus

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
what i calculate and bureau of labor
 
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.069 align:start position:0%
what i calculate and bureau of labor
statistics

00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't like the fact that
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
people like me
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
calculate a different unemployment rate
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
so i can't call it um
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
the same thing otherwise they would take
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
away my birthday and my
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
funding but this is you know
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
i did this for every state but take a
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
look at all of the people who are
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
collecting benefits
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of the pre-pandemic
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
labor force to come up with what i call
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
the kova 19 affected unemployment rate
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
to me that's a better measure of how our
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
labor market
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
has been affected by the pandemic and
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
where we are right now
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
so while new hampshire has an official
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
rate of 3.0
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
and that's here i don't know if that
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
shows up
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
my marker here um
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know i calculate and i haven't done
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
it for the most
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
recent week um but is about 5.6
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
and vermont has a ridiculous 2.9
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate not because they've
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
had they they had a lot of jobs but
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
because their labor force is shrinking
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
um they're what i calculate is their
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
real unemployment rate if everybody
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
who's collecting unemployment benefits
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're counting
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
is over 10 percent the other end you see
 
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.190 align:start position:0%
is over 10 percent the other end you see
some

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
states that actually benefit from the
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
covet 19 affected unemployment those are
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
states that tend not to have a lot of
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
people collecting the pua
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
and the puc benefits and because the
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
coveted rate that i calculate uses
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic labor force
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
they have more people
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the labor force not as many people
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
collecting on benefits
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
and as a result their their rate
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
actually drops that's a little bit of an
 
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.549 align:start position:0%
actually drops that's a little bit of an
esoteric

00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
esoteric
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
um piece of data but i i
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
really have a hard time suggesting that
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're at a three percent
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment i know it makes us feel
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
um but you know we know there's too many
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
people unemployed to suggest that we're
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
almost back to where we were prior to
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
the pandemic we have we have a ways to
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
go we're
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
we're making some significant
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
improvement but we have a ways to go
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
another private sector source of data
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
that i look at
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
is moody's analytics and cnn
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
put together what they call the back to
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
normal index and it uses
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
seven or eight state level economic
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
variables pieces of data along with
 
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.349 align:start position:0%
variables pieces of data along with
about

00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
16 to 20 national
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
economic variables and it calculates
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
how close to pre-pandemic
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
economic activity each state and the
 
00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:20.470 align:start position:0%
economic activity each state and the
nation

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
is it doesn't mean that
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's economy was exactly
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
or very close to the u.s economy what it
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
means is that we're
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
right now just about 11
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
below where we were prior to the
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic the u.s economy is about 13
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
below and the new hampshire the
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
massachusetts economy
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
is about 19 below what it was performing
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
at prior
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic so again it shows that
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
we made
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
improvement we were making really rapid
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
improvement throughout
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
you know after we got through the peak
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic april may
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
june we were making really significant
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
improvement through the summer
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
again the fall started to see a pickup
 
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
again the fall started to see a pickup
in

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
in covid cases and it set us back
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
until the early part of this year and
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see again a pickup in
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
economic activity i expect that that's
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
going to accelerate
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
um i mentioned um remote work
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
is a really critical um issue
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
emerging um it has implications things
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
that you folks deal with
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
um you know i'm not prepared to talk
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
about but you know
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
how how we tax workers that live in one
 
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:39.670 align:start position:0%
how how we tax workers that live in one
place

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
and work in another all of those issues
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
that are gonna make their way to the
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court i assume
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
um but the interesting thing is um
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen a pickup
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
in our employment but we haven't seen
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
as significant a return to daily
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
trips to workplaces in the state again
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
another private sector
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
source high frequency done every day
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
this data is produced google
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
as you know collects data on where you
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
are based on your location of your cell
 
00:52:16.079 --> 00:52:16.870 align:start position:0%
are based on your location of your cell
phone

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
and they translate that or turn that
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
into what they call their mobility
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
reports and you can get this data
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
at the state level and also at the
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
county level
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
so it varies by county in new hampshire
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
but what it shows
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
is that you know during the peak of the
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic people weren't
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
traveling to work so it dropped almost
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
it picked up again as people went back
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
to work but it has leveled off
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
and it's leveled off partly because we
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
still have people
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
who are collecting unemployment and are
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
not going to work but also
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
a really significant increase in remote
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
work that is likely
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
to be maintained prior to the pandemic
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
we had maybe seven percent of
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
of our workforce that was working
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
remotely either all or part of the time
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
i think by the end of the pin you know
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
but when it finally all shakes out we'll
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
probably be in the 15 percent range
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit higher that has some
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
real significant
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
implications one is
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
people are kind of getting used to
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
remote work and they're expecting it
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i said this to i spoke to human
 
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.390 align:start position:0%
and i said this to i spoke to human
resource

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
resource
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
people a couple of weeks ago you better
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
have a plan
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
in your organization for how do you
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
handle that not everybody wants to work
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
at home full-time but a lot of them want
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
some hybrid
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
you know working a few days a week at
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
home or a couple of days a week at home
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
and that will have some impact i think
 
00:53:40.079 --> 00:53:41.349 align:start position:0%
and that will have some impact i think
on

00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
you know who gets hired in new hampshire
 
00:53:44.079 --> 00:53:45.430 align:start position:0%
you know who gets hired in new hampshire
versus

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
again hired in another state but living
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
that remote work and i think i showed
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
this chart in january
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
is a great opportunity as well as
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
you know a potential threat the
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity is when people can live
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
anywhere they want and it doesn't have
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be next to their work they choose to
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
live in places
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
that you know are more attractive new
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire is one of those places so
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
two of our neighbors who we tend to
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
attract people
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
from who tend to move here are
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and connecticut and they
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
are both
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
they both have a lot of uh telework
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
teleworkers they saw large increases in
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that said they
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
increased their
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
telework opportunities new hampshire was
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
number four on the list by the way
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
so um i expect that that presents us
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
with an opportunity and i'll show you
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
some data that suggests that's actually
 
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.670 align:start position:0%
some data that suggests that's actually
happening

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
that more people are going to live in
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire not necessarily
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
work here and oh by the way
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
that has really been you know that's
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
that is really the story behind new
 
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.349 align:start position:0%
that is really the story behind new
hampshire's

00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire's
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
great um industrial transformation that
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
happened in the 70s and
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the 80s we had a lot we were
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
attracting a lot of people because we
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
had cheaper
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
housing and you know much cheaper we
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
as we still have cheaper but not as
 
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:12.870 align:start position:0%
as we still have cheaper but not as
cheap

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
cheap
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
relative to other states and it was just
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
a great place to live
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
those people many of them continue to
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
work in massachusetts
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
or somewhere else but eventually
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
you know they became a real part of our
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
labor force companies recognized that we
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
had this
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
upskilling in our labor force and you
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
know we became a place that people said
 
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.309 align:start position:0%
know we became a place that people said
oh

00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
you know if we locate there we can
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
attract some of that talent so that's
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
the downside is is that also the remote
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
work will
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
allow those people to live here and even
 
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.309 align:start position:0%
allow those people to live here and even
if

00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
there are people who have lived here
 
00:55:46.319 --> 00:55:47.670 align:start position:0%
there are people who have lived here
forever

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's going to be more companies
 
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
coming after our talent so we're going
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
to have to compete
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
um you know more it's going to be more
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
competition for the skilled workers and
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of them in our state
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be great for us
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
demographically it is already starting
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
to be very good for us demographically
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
on the remote work trend but it's also
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
going to present
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
our employers with a challenge in terms
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
of competing
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
for those workers and oh by the way i
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
you know wage structures and you know we
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't offer the same wage rates as
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know some of our neighbors
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
particularly in massachusetts
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have the cost of
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
commuting boy that's an easy decision to
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
to you know to work for an employer um
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
in that state
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
still live in new hampshire to really
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
benefit from that maximize we're going
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
to have to
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to have to keep get
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
some of those workers to work in new
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire as well
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
i mentioned the um you know the benefit
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
in terms of remote working
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
we're seeing it this is again private
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
sector data it's from realtor.com
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it looked at online views of homes
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
for sale
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
in different areas i broke it it's a
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
very busy chart i apologize for that but
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
there's two massachusetts um
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
read counties there and there at the
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
bottom and it what this shows is the
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
year-over-year change in
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
the online views of homes for sale i
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
will tell you i looked at this
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
nationally i looked at it in a lot of
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
places new hampshire
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
had two to three times
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
the increase that most other places had
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
i mean there are some other rural states
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
that had
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
similar but in the northeast um you know
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire got
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
more interest in um you know home views
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
people looking to move here and we're
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
we're seeing it anecdotally in terms of
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know home purchases
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things on my to-do list is to
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
look at where
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
the homes that are bought where the
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
buyers come from but anecdotally we
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
are hearing more out-of-state buyers
 
00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:54.150 align:start position:0%
are hearing more out-of-state buyers
interestingly

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
about this data is that some of our more
 
00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.750 align:start position:0%
about this data is that some of our more
rural

00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
rural
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
counties saw the biggest increase
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
grafton county
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
being one of them belknap county
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
so kind of the you know people were not
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
only looking
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
compared to looking in suffolk and
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
middlesex county where we tend to get
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of people from they were looking
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
within new hampshire they were
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
increasing their views
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit further north you know so i
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
think again that
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
bodes well for the demographics of some
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
counties fortunately unfortunately
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
there weren't enough data for coast
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
county to show what happened there i
 
00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:34.789 align:start position:0%
county to show what happened there i
wish

00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
wish
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
we did have that data because i think
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific as well
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
but it is a positive trend it indicates
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
that you know more people are interested
 
00:58:43.359 --> 00:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
that you know more people are interested
in

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire just adding to your
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
factual base i get a postcard about
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
every two
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
two and a half weeks urging me to
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
consider selling my home
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i get a lot of those too i get
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
phone calls and texts
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
i live in the southern part of the state
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
but i was getting texts and phone calls
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i just didn't respond um but you
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
know there's
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of supply and so
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know if there were if there were a
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
greater supply we would see
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
more people we would see great in
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
migration here
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
and in my county better broadband
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah i mean again first
 
00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.349 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah i mean again first
requirement

00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
oh yeah and and you know it's this is a
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful the remote work
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
phenomena is a wonderful opportunity for
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
some of our more rural
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
regions unfortunately that is you know
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
that's one of those you know
 
00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:43.270 align:start position:0%
that's one of those you know
prerequisites

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
prerequisites
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to maybe definitely impede
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
some regions that could benefit from
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
that trend um that's been true for a
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
while but here we have this very
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
i think unique opportunity um
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
to increase our our rate of um you know
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
in migration
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
which is important and and which by the
 
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
way gets to this slide
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday there was a report again about
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's population growth and
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
slower than massachusetts
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
look message i i eliminated one of the
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
charts i was going to put in here
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
our the way we grow is very different
 
01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:16.710 align:start position:0%
our the way we grow is very different
massachusetts

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
has pretty strong birth rates
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
um for new england so they have you know
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
they they get a lot of international
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
migration and they get
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know they have higher birth rates
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
because they have demographics that tend
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
to have higher birth rates
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire traditionally oh and i've
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
looked at this data for 20 years
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
has either the number one or number two
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
lowest birth rate of any state in the
 
01:00:37.839 --> 01:00:39.030 align:start position:0%
lowest birth rate of any state in the
nation

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
nation
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
that does a couple of things it one
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
makes your median age rise pretty
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
quickly because the quickest
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
the easiest way to get your median age
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
or keep it low is to add
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
individuals at age zero meaning birth
 
01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.109 align:start position:0%
individuals at age zero meaning birth
rates

01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
so we have and this is not going to
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
change by the web
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
by the way because we have and i've said
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
this before probably in this committee
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
we have women who participate in the
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
labor force at very high rates and we
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
have well educated women and that is a
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
recipe for lower
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
birth rates that's not going to change
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
so the way we will grow
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
is attracting individuals by in that in
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
migration that is absolutely critical to
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
our population growth we are fortunate
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
in new england
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
that you know unlike massachusetts which
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
tends to see net outmigration
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
we and connecticut we tend to see net in
 
01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.750 align:start position:0%
we and connecticut we tend to see net in
migration

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
migration
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
so when in-migration picks up it's a
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
benefit to us
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
remote work provides a additional
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to bolster that it
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
had been picking up
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
anyway it's also picking up
 
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.470 align:start position:0%
anyway it's also picking up
interestingly

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
among younger populations um
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
traditionally we had
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
attracted a lot of 30 to 44 45 year old
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
married couple families with kids we you
 
01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:54.710 align:start position:0%
married couple families with kids we you
know

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
import our kids but it's moved down a
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing more in the 25 to 29
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
year old it tends to be located in
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
certain communities
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
but overall that whole
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
notion of of in-migration is really
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
critical to our to our population and
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
labor force growth
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
um minus
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
0.76 oh i'm sorry that's a
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
a measure of the relationship the
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
correlation between those two variables
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
so if if the two variables
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
median age and fertility rates
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
moved exactly the same meaning if if the
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
fertility rate
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely determined the median age
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
you'd see a one
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
a value of one there
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
but there's other factors that play into
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
it too so it's a little bit lower so
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
that number varies from um
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know from plus 1 to negative 1. so
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
what that shows that negative
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
76 shows that 0.76 shows that
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
the relationship is is strong and
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
negative so the higher the birth rate
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the lower the median age
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
and the lower the or the higher the
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
median aids the lower the birth rate
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
or the lower the um median age the
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
higher the birth rate however you want
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
to look at it
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
so it's a strong relationship and you
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
can see it there that line that runs
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
through it
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
as you move to the right you know utah
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
is down at the bottom
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
they have very very high birth rates
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
large mormon families
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
they also have the lowest median age of
 
01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.230 align:start position:0%
they also have the lowest median age of
any

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
state in the nation so birth rates are
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
critical it's a big reason why our
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
median age is high
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
i've done demographic presentations
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
where i show
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
we you know we don't have the you know
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
people say we're the oldest state we
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
don't have the highest percentage
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
or second highest percent second highest
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
median age we don't have the second
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
or first highest percentage of
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
individuals over you know what
 
01:04:00.079 --> 01:04:00.870 align:start position:0%
individuals over you know what
considered

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
um you know senior citizens we don't
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
we're you know we're high but
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the order of you know 15th
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
or 14th somewhere like that
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
but it's the fact that we have these
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
very low birth rates that really
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
contribute to our median beating ace as
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
true in vermont as well
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
um looking at that migration i you know
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
again this
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
i could go back much further here um a
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
couple of decades where you'd see
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
years where we had you know between
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
regularly between 15 and 20
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
000 net domestic meaning more people
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
moving into new hampshire from another
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
state than left
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
this just shows the most recent um you
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
know 20 years
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
and you know it had been declining in
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
the 2000s it went negative in that
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
um you know starting with the great
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
recession and you know
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
and a bit afterwards um
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
it was difficult to move here because
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
most of people that moved here would
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
have had to sell a house somewhere else
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
demographics of who he had attracted and
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
they would have wanted to buy a house
 
01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.190 align:start position:0%
they would have wanted to buy a house
here

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
both of those things were difficult
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
largely because selling a house during
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
that time period meant a lot of people
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
were still underwater
 
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
anyway a lot of reasons why we saw
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
net domestic out migration that was a
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
very bad
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
sign for new hampshire it wasn't you
 
01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:23.349 align:start position:0%
sign for new hampshire it wasn't you
know

01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
just young people leaving um young
 
01:05:26.319 --> 01:05:26.710 align:start position:0%
just young people leaving um young
people

01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
have been leaving the state and they
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
leave all rural states
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
for decades it was the fact that we
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
weren't seeing our typical
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
group um you know level of people moving
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
into the state that
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
that you know had been characteristic
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
for the prior few decades
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
so it picked up again near the end of
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
the decade and i think this year
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
and i may be even a little bit
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
understating what could happen in those
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
outer years
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
2020 i think we'll be up around 6 500.
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i've i you know i ratcheted it down
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit because i don't want to
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be hyperbolic but that's
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know that's a very
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
positive um level you know if we can
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
continue to keep approximately at that
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
level that helps
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
make that um median age a little bit
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
more stationary it's not
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
up in the 10 000 range which would
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
really help if you can add a lot of
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
people in the middle
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
you know and that even now we're adding
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
more 25 to 30
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
29 but if you even if you add people in
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
that 30 to 40
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
which is traditionally who we've
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
attracted the most
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
you keep your median age from rising
 
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.270 align:start position:0%
you keep your median age from rising
significantly

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to be lowered by
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of babies being born that's just
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
not happening it's not go
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen in new
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire um i'm getting close to the
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
end here
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
my job forecast way different than the
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
last time i was here
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
which i think was a little over one
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
percent there and then
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
up to around you know just under three
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
percent for 2022. so
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm basically saying 3.8 percent for
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
2021 2.7
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
for 2022. now i do recognize
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
that the the exactly when that falls
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
could change so it could be
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
2.7 or 2.5 in 2021
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
and then well over three in 2022 so the
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
exact timing that's a little bit
 
01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.430 align:start position:0%
exact timing that's a little bit
different

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
but i think if you average you know we
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
we gain you know about six percent six
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
and a half percent that now that puts us
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
right near getting back to full
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
employment by the end of that
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
or where we were prior to the pandemic
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
by 2022 and
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
certainly in 2012 by 2023 we will be
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
um again so i'm going to go back to this
 
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.829 align:start position:0%
um again so i'm going to go back to this
chart

01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
chart
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
which i showed at the very beginning
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
where we were prior to the pandemic
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
where i had forecast before the pandemic
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
where we would be
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
in a couple of years where we are now
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
the red line
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
so what is that forecast that i just
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
showed you imply
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
and it implies this one that again
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
we get back to
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
um you know where we were prior to the
 
01:08:12.799 --> 01:08:13.990 align:start position:0%
um you know where we were prior to the
pandemic

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere later in 2022
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
and then we about a year later before we
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
get back up to
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
trend where we were the rate at which we
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
were growing
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
so it it will take time um my guess
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
is that it will feel a lot better than
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
the actual numbers i think you know
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to see
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
hiring we're going to see a lot of
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
economic activity
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
but because we lost so many of those
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
jobs um
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
those the numbers are still it's not
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
going to look as
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this chart it's not going to
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
look like a roaring economy but i do
 
01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:50.229 align:start position:0%
look like a roaring economy but i do
think

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know we're on the verge of of really
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
a really strong economic
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
um you know for at least a year probably
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
a year and a half and maybe a little bit
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
um gdp growth this is my forecast for
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
gdp again
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
i i will regain our gdp much quicker
 
01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.309 align:start position:0%
i i will regain our gdp much quicker
than

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
than our jobs partly because we a lot of
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
the jobs that we lost were
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know what are considered lower
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
productivity jobs jobs that
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
gross product um and the jobs that we're
 
01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:22.309 align:start position:0%
gross product um and the jobs that we're
adding

01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
adding
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
again it gets back to that chart of the
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
wages that i showed the jobs lost
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
much lower wages the the jobs that we
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
gained were much higher
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
so we're making that trade-off of higher
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
value-added jobs
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
being gained lower and that contributes
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
to us getting our gdp level back before
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
we get our
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
all of our jobs back now
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
things that you're really interested in
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
and i apologize i
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know i in the past have done a lot
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
of revenue work
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
on different aspects of revenue really
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to do that but i just
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
put together a couple of charts
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
this is a chart that shows business tax
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
revenues combined
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
bet and bpt revenues and it's a it's
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
each of those points on that line is
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
the 12 months prior to the sum of the 12
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
months prior
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
so it gives you an idea of the
 
01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.590 align:start position:0%
so it gives you an idea of the
annualized

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
annualized
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
um bpt
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
and be business taxes and what you see
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
really interestingly obviously
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know the recession there was a big
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
drop um
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
didn't you know grow that much early
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
from in recovery from the great
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
recession the big
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
change here is what happened after you
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
know the tax reform or whatever you want
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
to call it uh you know in 2018
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
and you knew this a big anomalous
 
01:10:45.679 --> 01:10:46.550 align:start position:0%
and you knew this a big anomalous
increase

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
in business tax revenues huge increase
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
that was going to decline and was
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
beginning to decline
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic the pandemic made
 
01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:57.270 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic the pandemic made
it

01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
decline even more but it's bounced back
 
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
decline even more but it's bounced back
again

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
and it's bounced back so it's above
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
trend line the trend line
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
is that red you know series of dots so
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's really above
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know it's above trend and
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
so obviously some you know there's been
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
some fundamental changes as a result of
 
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.709 align:start position:0%
some fundamental changes as a result of
that

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
of the reform act that's yielded more
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
more revenue even in a in a relatively
 
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:25.990 align:start position:0%
more revenue even in a in a relatively
weaker

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
weaker
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
um economy um taking a look
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
at kind of i want to make that
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
distinction between how the business
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
taxes re
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
perform and how the non-business taxes
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
reform and so i look at
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
i tend to look at the nine largest what
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
i call economically sensitive revenue
 
01:11:42.159 --> 01:11:42.790 align:start position:0%
i call economically sensitive revenue
sources

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know you have plenty of revenue
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
sources that just don't really vary
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
much by by the um you know by economic
 
01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.110 align:start position:0%
much by by the um you know by economic
conditions

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know you know fines uh
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know that doesn't really change so i
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
look at the ones that tend to vary by
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
um and they they represent the bulk of
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
of revenue so this is
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
um what on a percentage basis the
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
same thing taking the sum of uh
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know the prior 12 months how
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
revenues have changed
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
when you look at all of those nine
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
largest sources so
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
big increases prior to the to the great
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
recession big declines
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
during the great recession and then had
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
these ups and downs until you had a big
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
increase again
 
01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
with after the 2018
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
changes the federal tax laws so big
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
increase saw again a decrease
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
um with the pandemic but that's
 
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.669 align:start position:0%
um with the pandemic but that's
including

01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know business taxes when you look at
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
what's happened with
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
not you know excluding the business
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
taxes a couple of things stand out when
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
i look at this chart one
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
is that for most of the time period
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
those two
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
measures kind of varied the same so
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
when non-business taxes grew business
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
taxes tended to grow and
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
grow you know at us not exactly the same
 
01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:07.830 align:start position:0%
grow you know at us not exactly the same
pace

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
pace
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
but similar so you know it it made sense
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
revenues both business and non-business
 
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.590 align:start position:0%
revenues both business and non-business
revenues

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
reflected more economic the economic
 
01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.790 align:start position:0%
reflected more economic the economic
conditions

01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
again when you look at what happened
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the uh following the the the
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
tax changes the federal tax changes in
 
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.790 align:start position:0%
tax changes the federal tax changes in
2019

01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
when you add in business taxes a big
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
increase but when you look at
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
non-business taxes
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know there was kind of the typical
 
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.110 align:start position:0%
you know there was kind of the typical
growth

01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know it was growing two percent or a
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
little under two percent it did pick up
 
01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:45.590 align:start position:0%
little under two percent it did pick up
it

01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
just before the pandemic but it
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
declined it didn't decline as much as
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the business taxes but it gives you
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
an idea that we've
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
sort of made a break since the
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
tax reform or tax changes at the federal
 
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:01.510 align:start position:0%
tax reform or tax changes at the federal
level

01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
seen a little bit of a break in terms of
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
that historical relationship between
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
um and i you know i don't know exactly
 
01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.669 align:start position:0%
um and i you know i don't know exactly
what

01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
how to attribute that and i don't know
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
how long it will last
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you folks have much better idea
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
than do i
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
but it is interesting because um
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know we tend to focus a lot on on
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
the business tax changes but you know
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
if you look at the long-term trend and
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
the non-business taxes it's not nearly
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know if it's not nearly as favorable
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
i mean it's you know pretty modest
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
growth um so it's really been the
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
business tax changes and particularly
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
the business
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
tax revenue changes since the 2018
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
been the driving force be behind what's
 
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.510 align:start position:0%
been the driving force be behind what's
um

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
you know what's happened with our
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
revenue so um you know any changes
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
that are made to that are you know are
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
going to really represent the bulk of
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
of what happens to revenues over the
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
next couple of years
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i know this was a topic of interest
 
01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.350 align:start position:0%
and i know this was a topic of interest
so

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
on very short notice i looked at data
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i didn't have time to break it out
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
by industry
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
but i did have time last evening to
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
break it out
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
by the type of organization because i
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
think it has implications
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know um you know the discussions
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
around taxing
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
um those grants and whether they're
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
loans or grants
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
i i you know i confess to not having
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
followed that very closely
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
but this gives you an idea you know
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
overall there was
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
almost 3.6 billion dollars in ppp loans
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
through april
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
13th that had been issued to new
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
organizations in new hampshire um the
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
bulk of that
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
um went to corporations llcs and llps
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
limited liability partnerships
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
sub-chapter s
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
corporations so when you add that
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
outside what 85
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
or so um or close to it
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
of those loans went to
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
um you know organizations that are
 
01:16:11.679 --> 01:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
um you know organizations that are
likely

01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
likely
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
you know a significant portion of who
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
pays the bpt and the bet
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
now i put in red here the sole
 
01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.950 align:start position:0%
now i put in red here the sole
proprietorships

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
proprietorships
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
because i'm a little bit skeptical this
 
01:16:24.719 --> 01:16:26.470 align:start position:0%
because i'm a little bit skeptical this
data

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
is you know reported by the lender and
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
by sba
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
but i looked at that sole proprietorship
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
data and i looked at
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
loans over 150k and i
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
spotted some names and i didn't go
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
through the whole list
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
but of cour of organizations that are
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
not sole proprietorships
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
they you know a 3.2 million dollar
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
ppp loan to a sole proprietorship i
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't think so and i know the company so
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
and i know they're not a sole
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
proprietorship so i'm a little bit
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
skeptical of this
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
my guess is a fair amount of this that's
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
in the sole proprietorship
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
winds up being in one of these up here
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
um so this gives you an idea of
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know what's out there and how it's
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
distributed and i don't know
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
exactly how that helps you but i thought
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
i would include it
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
because i know it's of interest and um
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's my last slide and i'm
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
happy to talk uh or take questions i
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
hope i didn't miss questions along the
 
01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.189 align:start position:0%
hope i didn't miss questions along the
way

01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
brian that was an excellent presentation
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
i got more out of it than i thought i
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
would and
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
you had low expectations i always meet
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
low expectations representative major
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually uh you provided information i
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
didn't think
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
it was going to be available and i
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
i certainly appreciate such a short
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
schedule responding and presenting this
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative the model
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking a question uh i
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
noticed in the beginning
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
one of the first slides about half of
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire population is employed
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
is is that how does that statistic
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
line up with other states well um
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean you what you need to do and
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have it off the top my head is
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
the employment the population ratio
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
um but it's really what you want to do
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
is look at
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
the the um the population that is
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
of employable age so 16
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
above and um we generally have
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
um a you know a higher than i don't know
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
off the top my head where we're at
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
but that is actually and i usually don't
 
01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.070 align:start position:0%
but that is actually and i usually don't
include

01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
that metric in my presentation because
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of people aren't familiar with it
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
but when you really want to know where
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
where we're at you take a look at that
 
01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:05.830 align:start position:0%
where we're at you take a look at that
that

01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
ratio of people who are working to the
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know the potential working age
 
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.149 align:start position:0%
you know the potential working age
population

01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
so not just who's in the labor force but
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
the potential labor force
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
and that gives you really a good idea of
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
where you're at
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
and it gives it would give us a really
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
good um
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
idea of how you know how our
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
economy is performing relative to prior
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh to the um the pandemic
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i will look at that and get back to
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
you on that because
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
you made me think that maybe i should
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
start including it i i
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
i struggle with it because it's a little
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
bit harder metric
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
to explain in a in a in a presentation
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
but it's really an important one so the
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
ratio of people who are working to those
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the the working age population is
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
really an important metric
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
and would that change with um with the
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
tele it probably i mean
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
in theory it could um i don't know of
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
any research that's
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
shown that i mean i guess you know one
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
theory is that
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to work from home will
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
unlock some
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who are unable to
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
work or enter the labor force because
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
of you know either you know home care or
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
health or whatever or
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
or disability issues so in theory
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
you know that could potentially i don't
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
know that it would make
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
a huge difference um i do know that you
 
01:20:36.159 --> 01:20:36.550 align:start position:0%
a huge difference um i do know that you
know

01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
every everywhere that ratio has declined
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
because more people have stepped out of
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
the labor force
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
um either because they had to or because
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
they lost their jobs but
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of it's you know simply because
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
people haven't been
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
you know there's fewer people who are
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
able to work again women in particular
 
01:20:53.199 --> 01:20:53.669 align:start position:0%
able to work again women in particular
have

01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
have you know had their labor force
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
participation cut back because they're
 
01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.629 align:start position:0%
participation cut back because they're
primary

01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
caregivers and that burden generally
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
falls on them there's fewer of those
 
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.750 align:start position:0%
falls on them there's fewer of those
opportunities

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
um but it's a it's a really important
 
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.430 align:start position:0%
um but it's a it's a really important
metric

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
metric
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
and i it's an interesting point because
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
i hadn't thought of that the potential
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
that it could
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know it would be you know it's not
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
going to increase it by a percent but it
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
might increase it by some
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know if it could increase that
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
employment to population ratio
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know a few tenths of a percent
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's still
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
very important that would be a very
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
important increase
 
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
um hi um thanks for that very good
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
presentation um do you track
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
data on the numbers of school-aged
 
01:21:48.239 --> 01:21:49.510 align:start position:0%
data on the numbers of school-aged
children

01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and changes over time
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
what's happening happening now yeah i
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
mean you know that that data
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a very high frequency data you
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
know and it's an estimate
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
um we do the best day that we have
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
is um in terms what comes from the
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
department of education in terms of
 
01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.110 align:start position:0%
department of education in terms of
enrollments

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
enrollments
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
um you know that gives us some idea
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
um the you know the population data
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
comes out on an annual basis an estimate
 
01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:20.629 align:start position:0%
comes out on an annual basis an estimate
but

01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
yeah we you know i don't have a um
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
a strong use for that data but i am
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
aware of it and we do know that that
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
it has been declining um because we know
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
enrollments have been declining
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
um interestingly though during the
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic we saw some unexpected
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
increases in some of our rural school
 
01:22:38.639 --> 01:22:39.430 align:start position:0%
increases in some of our rural school
districts

01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
again you know it was people who were
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
looking to you know the the move toward
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
less density
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know people moving from more densely
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
populated areas
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
picking you know whether again whether
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
they stay and remain but
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
i heard anecdotally you know from
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
from some school districts had
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
unexpected increases in fall enrollments
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
this past year and a lot of that had to
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
do with people
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
just you know looking for you know to to
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
leave areas that were more densely
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
populated for health pandemic reasons
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
related reasons but we do have that um
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know i don't have a regular use for
 
01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:18.709 align:start position:0%
you know i don't have a regular use for
it

01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
um but we do have it yeah
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you just some more statistics
 
01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.149 align:start position:0%
okay thank you just some more statistics
on

01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh when
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
representation and i were on the
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
education funding committee back in 99
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
there was about 210 000
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
registered students grades 1 to 12
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and now i guess that
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
number has come down to about 176
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
thousand so
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem and it's dropping
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
yep that's an elliott followed by
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative elmi
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh brian thank you for that
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful presentation
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if all of that
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
information is going to be lost to us
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
or whether someone is going to mail to
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
that entire presentation that you just
 
01:24:14.639 --> 01:24:15.270 align:start position:0%
that entire presentation that you just
gave

01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
gave
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
because my iq is about one-tenth of
 
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.830 align:start position:0%
because my iq is about one-tenth of
yours

01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
yours
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
i need time to study those things
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
yeah bob i i brian said he was going to
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
email that to jennifer and jenna
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
jennifer will get it to every member of
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful yeah and and if you have
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
questions after you
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
look it over and i know i you know i
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
present a lot and i do it
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
too quickly and not always as cogently
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
as i could
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
um if you you know when you look at it
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
and you have questions feel free
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
to contact me and i'll do my best i'm
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
not sure i'll have the answers but i'll
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
do my best to
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know i'll make something up if i
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the answers if i want
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know you should know me well enough
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
to know that i am frequently in air but
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
rarely in doubt
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
i say that all the time what email
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
should we use
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
um use my nhes
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
email jennifer has it thank you
 
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.590 align:start position:0%
email jennifer has it thank you
representative

01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh brian
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
is that have you looked at a
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
relationship between the fertility rate
 
01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.310 align:start position:0%
relationship between the fertility rate
and

01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
labor force participation are those
 
01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.750 align:start position:0%
labor force participation are those
trade-offs

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
trade-offs
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah there is a trade-off and i and um
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
you know lower fertility rates are
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
generally associated with a couple of
 
01:25:38.639 --> 01:25:39.189 align:start position:0%
generally associated with a couple of
things

01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
women who participate in the labor force
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
at high rates and higher levels of
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
educational attainment
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
so i you know it is
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know i say some of our demographics
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
are the result of our successes not our
 
01:25:53.199 --> 01:25:54.229 align:start position:0%
are the result of our successes not our
failures

01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
failures
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
one of our successes or a couple of them
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
is that we have women who
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
participate in the labor force at high
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
rates and
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
because they have they're well educated
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
and they have higher skills
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
than a lot of states and that is a
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
recipe for
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know for low fertility rates so it
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
is you know it does provide a benefit
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean you know when i look at
 
01:26:15.199 --> 01:26:15.910 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean you know when i look at
um

01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know the child care issue and how
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
that impedes the labor force it tends to
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
impede labor force at
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
um you know lower among women who have
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
lower levels of education
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
and skill attainment which is really
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because those are
 
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
individuals who would
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
you know their lives that would benefit
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
the most from the ability to participate
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
in labor force
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
um but so you know
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
generally having you know children
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
if you have a higher level of
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
educational attainment generally you're
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to have a lower fertility
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
families are smaller so
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
it is a there is a definite relationship
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about it
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's definite relation i mean there
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
are other factors that enter into it but
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
it plays a strong role
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
here i'm along the same line of
 
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.750 align:start position:0%
here i'm along the same line of
discussion

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
um brian i'm wondering um is there a way
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
to isolate
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
what proportion of the population has
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
has you know self-selected to step out
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the labor force
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
yes what kind of what are we looking at
 
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.669 align:start position:0%
yes what kind of what are we looking at
there

01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
well um the way we do it here i've done
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
it here
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
is one of the new programs
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
that was established by the federal
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
government to deal
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
with people affected by the pandemic is
 
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.629 align:start position:0%
with people affected by the pandemic is
the

01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic unemployment assistance program
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
and people have to
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
basically certify um as to why
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
they are unable to work and they they're
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
given a number of choices one of them
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
is health reasons one is having to take
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
care of somebody who has a health reason
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
and that one of the
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
health reasons is you know some you have
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
to have a doctor say that
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know you should not have be in an
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
environment you know
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
for this reason or whatever um another
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
one is
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh i needed to take care of a child who
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
is not in school or in a daycare
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
um during the pandemic and that's a
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know that's an important one that
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
just to give you some numbers is
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere over
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know around 3 000 currently it's
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
gone down somewhat
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know at school it's more schools
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
have opened up now that's just a portion
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
of people who aren't in the labor force
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
because of child care issues because
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's people who weren't
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
collecting weren't working before who
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
aren't in the workforce because
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know they never they or they've been
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
out of the labor force for some reason
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
so the child care issue contribute
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is just one who for people who were
 
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
this is just one who for people who were
working

01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
stepped out of the labor force or unable
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
to work because they had to attend to
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know take care of a child for that
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
reason there are a few other reasons
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
but we do have that and we actually have
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
some you know his i have historical data
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
on historical meaning
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
going back to probably sometime in the
 
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.830 align:start position:0%
going back to probably sometime in the
summer

01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury thank you mr
 
01:29:18.639 --> 01:29:19.510 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury thank you mr
chairman

01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
brian it's an extraordinary presentation
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
i think especially because of the broad
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
range of metrics you've shown us
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
things like uh online
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh home searches and so on yeah but i
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
have two questions
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh from the chart you showed us
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
of the trend lines for new hampshire
 
01:29:40.719 --> 01:29:41.669 align:start position:0%
of the trend lines for new hampshire
revenue

01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
right right both the bet bpt and then
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
the the non um
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
the first question is there was a very
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
marked surge above trend
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
coming into 19 and before the pandemic
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
and uh you you did mention the influence
 
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.189 align:start position:0%
and uh you you did mention the influence
of

01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
the 2018 federal tax law changes
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
but are there other factors that you
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
think were
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
drivers of that surge and uh
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
where do those perhaps stand coming
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
out of the pan batman yeah i i don't
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
know i think
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know if i were to think about one
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
more recently
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know i mean i think the ppp loans
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
probably have some impact
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
um and and i think and the reason i
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
think that is
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
um and and i i don't know how those are
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
accounted for i'm not an accountant i
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
have no
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
accounting background but if if into if
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
companies are
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know if that provides grants as
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to loans to companies
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
obviously that's going to you know help
 
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.070 align:start position:0%
obviously that's going to you know help
their

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
potentially help their profitability or
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
their bottom line
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know if if if they're able to
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
um you know to pay for some of their
 
01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
um you know to pay for some of their
costs

01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
in that fashion um and it's not coming
 
01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:06.870 align:start position:0%
in that fashion um and it's not coming
out

01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
of their operating revenue i would
 
01:31:08.639 --> 01:31:10.149 align:start position:0%
of their operating revenue i would
assume

01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
assume
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
that it would increase their
 
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
profitability so that may account for
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
some of it
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
out coming you know as we went long
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
longer in the pandemic
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know you know i don't know all
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
the particulars in terms of the tax
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
law changes in 2018 and how i mean i've
 
01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:26.310 align:start position:0%
law changes in 2018 and how i mean i've
heard

01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
but honestly i didn't focus a lot on it
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
i think more recently
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of things happen when you come
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
out start to come out of a recession
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
generally profitability spikes anyway
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
it spikes because companies are leaner
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know they've they've done whatever
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
they can to cut their expenses
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
so as as an economy is coming out of
 
01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:47.830 align:start position:0%
so as as an economy is coming out of
recession

01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
recession
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
profits tend to really pop they tend to
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
really jump
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
to the extent that maybe ppp loans play
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
into that because companies are not
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
using operating revenue
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
for expenses theoretically and again i'm
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
not an accountant so i don't know how
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
they account for those it might make
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
their profitability increase even more
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
interestingly you know the ppp loans
 
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
have changed the january of this year
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
loans which is about just over a billion
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
of that 3.6 billion
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
those are supposedly only going to
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
companies that
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
had at least a 25 decline in their
 
01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:26.390 align:start position:0%
had at least a 25 decline in their
revenue

01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic or the past year so
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
those might not have the same impact in
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
terms of profitability
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know as the ones that you know
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
the companies that got loans regardless
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
of whether they had lost profitability
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
there was no criteria
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the first round the 2.5 billion that
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
went to new hampshire
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
there was no criteria for a company
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
having experienced a loss
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
in revenue um so in theory those
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
could be you know that money could
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
have gone to companies as long as 60 of
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
it went
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
for payroll um it becomes a grant
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
and in that case i i have a hard time
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
thinking it doesn't
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i mean it strikes me from that
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
chart that
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
we were fortunate in uh having such a
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
robust economy
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and the pandemic hit sure the other
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
question from that same charity is i
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
noticed a
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
particular spike in the non-business tax
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
revenue sources yeah about 2016.
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
so uh having not been uh in this scene
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
at that time i'm wondering if you can
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
which element of our taxes uh surged
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
then and why i can't to be honest with
 
01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:50.149 align:start position:0%
then and why i can't to be honest with
you

01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
um i had i had a little bit more time i
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
would have prepared
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
um you know i i said i used to do a lot
 
01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:57.590 align:start position:0%
um you know i i said i used to do a lot
more

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
um uh when i was in the private sector
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
for a lot of reasons i did a lot more
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
looking at individual revenues i still
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
maintain the database but i just don't
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
analyze it
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
the way i used to um so i you know off
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
the top of my head i just didn't look at
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
it enough to
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
to to be able to answer that i apologize
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
there has to be i don't know if there if
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
there were you know
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
a particular revenue source um that
 
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.070 align:start position:0%
a particular revenue source um that
jumped

01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
jumped
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
um and it very well may be because
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
but i would have to go back and look um
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
to see which ones
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
um increase the most i mean generally
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
they increase when the economy is strong
 
01:34:34.639 --> 01:34:34.950 align:start position:0%
they increase when the economy is strong
and

01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
you know in it was really in that
 
01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.629 align:start position:0%
you know in it was really in that
2015-16

01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
2015-16
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
time period when things really started
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
to get much better in new hampshire
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know we started to see really
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
significant it took us
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
quite a while to really emerge from the
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
from the great recession
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
we were growing more slowly than
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of places there was a lot of
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
concern i know among
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
lawmakers government officials and
 
01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:00.470 align:start position:0%
lawmakers government officials and
everybody

01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
my goodness the worst thing you could
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
say is that we were growing more slowly
 
01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:04.390 align:start position:0%
say is that we were growing more slowly
than

01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
adding fewer jobs in massachusetts on a
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
percentage basis
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
and worse than that there was times when
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
vermont was adding
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
jobs at a higher rate oh my god you know
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
cats and dogs were sleeping together the
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
world was very near
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
the end um but
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know eventually we caught up and you
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
know it accelerated
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a you know i can speculate
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
at another time on why some of that
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
happened but it was in that time period
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
where we really started to see an
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
increase and i think that contributed to
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
some of it but
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of specific revenues off the
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
top of my head i don't know i do have it
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
but i just
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
i haven't looked at it enough detail
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you you're covered a lot
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
like representative elliott i'm looking
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
forward to sitting down and reviewing
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
the hard copy
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
i think we all are ah
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
i hope i'm not quizzed on it later
 
01:35:59.119 --> 01:36:01.189 align:start position:0%
i hope i'm not quizzed on it later
because

01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
no quizzes all right and if you quiz you
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
gotta i gotta be graded on a curve
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're coming back at you uh i don't see
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%

dec aims he sent me
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
relative to california when i mentioned
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
this past week at california
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
the week before the senate had passed
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
their laws to allow
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
loan from their income
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
and it was in the other house and then
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
represent ames you want to talk about
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
what you had sent an email to me
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
what happened this week in california
 
01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.590 align:start position:0%
what happened this week in california
sure

01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
the california had this pending bill it
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
actually goes back a year
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
um but they've been considering
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
conforming like us they don't
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
automatically conform
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
and they delayed
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
um after the arpa enactment
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
because of concern that the tax cuts
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
provision in there that we've been
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
might be triggered by a
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
conformity decision in other words the
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
is essentially a a tax cut
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
and if that
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
was the kind of tax cut that's in uh
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's within the the scope of the tax
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
cuts provision
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
and arpa then um
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
you can't use opera money
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
to fill in behind that tax cut
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
apparently they were satisfied by that i
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any explanation
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
satisfied that that wouldn't happen in
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
other words
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
and i agree with them that the
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
information from
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
treasury makes clear that
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
conforming simply conforming your code
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
to the federal
 
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
tax exemption provisions will not
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
trigger that cut so they went forward
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
with their conformity provisions so what
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
did they do
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
in conforming it's a little more than
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
just conforming
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's trimming at the edges and one of
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
the interesting provisions is that they
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh took out
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
excluded from the exemption
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
that will that applies under federal law
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
and will now apply in california
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
why i don't know but that's a pretty
 
01:41:11.119 --> 01:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
why i don't know but that's a pretty
significant

01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
exclusion maybe not huge because
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
of the 500 employee limitation anyway in
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
the ppp program
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
but certainly something to be aware of
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
the other reason i sent that out
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
is that they they through their
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
i think it's called the california
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
franchise board
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
did a impact analysis
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
they call an economic and impact when
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
they're talking about
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
revenues and
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
came out with a significant cost
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
to doing this in california of course
 
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
california is huge and we're tiny
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
but the impact was about six billion
 
01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.830 align:start position:0%
but the impact was about six billion
dollars

01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
of uh lost revenue that would result
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
from this that's under both the personal
 
01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
from this that's under both the personal
income

01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
tax in california and the business tax
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
um but it's a big amount of money and
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
and uh i thought if we could
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
get our hands on that analysis it
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
certainly would be
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
helpful to dra into ways and means
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
to see if we're either missing something
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
or maybe california has looked at
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
something differently than
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it obviously there are
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
differences in our taxes
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
so that's maybe it's not all relevant
 
01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:38.790 align:start position:0%
so that's maybe it's not all relevant
but

01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh but it's worth looking at and
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you dick and i guess that's on its
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
way to the governor's office to be
 
01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.310 align:start position:0%
way to the governor's office to be
signed

01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
signed
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
yeah it's in his office it passed both
 
01:42:55.199 --> 01:42:56.790 align:start position:0%
yeah it's in his office it passed both
houses

01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
houses
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know let's say monday or tuesday
 
01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.550 align:start position:0%
i don't know let's say monday or tuesday
and

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
now it's there and he's said to be
 
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
in support of it okay
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday um i received
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
two more emails uh what i'm both from
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
walters pillsbury
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
and uh and walter i just haven't had
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
time because i'm
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
tied up with a medical things yesterday
 
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
very interesting and one has to do
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
from chris where money was taken out of
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
various funds directly state of health
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
and human services or to fund
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
building or any other thing and
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
we need more information on that and i
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
think what i'll do
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
is i'll concentrate to have
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
before the committee a better
 
01:43:59.679 --> 01:44:00.629 align:start position:0%
before the committee a better
explanation

01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
on this and it's a good catch
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
the other one has to do with uh
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg and you
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
talking together about coming up with an
 
01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.350 align:start position:0%
talking together about coming up with an
amendment

01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
for senate bill 3 do you want to mention
 
01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.790 align:start position:0%
for senate bill 3 do you want to mention
that

01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh sure um
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
i i think it may take a work session
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
to gauge the sentiment of the committee
 
01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.870 align:start position:0%
to gauge the sentiment of the committee
and

01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
what direction uh the group seems
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
inclined to take hp3 but
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned from the testimony that we
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
heard on tuesday
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
that uh if there's a political desire
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
to move with hb3 and
 
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
essentially stake a position that we're
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
not trying to tax
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
things that were grants for a hardship
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
but we may nevertheless need an
 
01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:57.430 align:start position:0%
but we may nevertheless need an
amendment

01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
that limits the extent to which uh
 
01:45:01.679 --> 01:45:02.390 align:start position:0%
that limits the extent to which uh
specific

01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
expenses can be utilized twice and so
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh i think the discussion it's going to
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
require us to have
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
is whether our motivation uh for hb3
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
is a perception that businesses are
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
being subjected to attacks
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh that is an unanticipated burden
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
or whether actually this is providing a
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
whole new source of stimulus a second
 
01:45:29.199 --> 01:45:30.149 align:start position:0%
whole new source of stimulus a second
benefit

01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
and is that a good public policy to do
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
it so
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that i'm considering
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
i alluded to the other day and
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg has indicated
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
that he'd like to
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
participate haven't thought through
 
01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.470 align:start position:0%
participate haven't thought through
language

01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
but it would be something that would
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
limit the ability to do that
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's worthwhile to have that
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
amendment ready
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
and whether we use it or not
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
at least have it ready and
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
i did receive another email
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday from susan and
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
along with it was a report for the
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting and i have
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
susan i have not had an opportunity to
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
read that bit
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
you may want to just give a quick
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
on yes well on i've
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
actually distributed it among the
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
democrats now most of whom were involved
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
but last year we also had a bill from
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
tom schamberg about on
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
instituting worldwide combined reporting
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
which is a fairly complicated issue
 
01:46:59.590 --> 01:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
and the whole committee both parties
 
01:46:59.600 --> 01:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
and the whole committee both parties
were

01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
interested in learning more about this
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
on the pandemic got in our way very
 
01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.270 align:start position:0%
on the pandemic got in our way very
badly

01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
badly
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
we could not get on
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
brent bandwidth from the state
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
to hold a meeting
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
a public meeting of both parties and
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
we went ahead with the uh
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
principal advocates of this
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
which include a very interesting group
 
01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.310 align:start position:0%
which include a very interesting group
of

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
businesses that started in the midwest
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
which are domestically based uh and
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
on we had a
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
um a very informative meeting in
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
in october of last year
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
and uh there was an enormous amount of
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
stuff going on
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
with the election and everything like
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
so it is just um
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
last two weeks ago that
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
when we took a break that i managed to
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
get back
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
and finish uh pulling together
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
all of the comments of of those
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
participants who spoke to us
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and on checking
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
back with everybody about it being an
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
accurate portrayal
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
and that is what i just passed on to
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
chair major i wanted him to decide when
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
and how
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
he uses it because on i think right now
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're still
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're working on revenues we're still
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
working on bills
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
but pretty soon our committee
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
which last year voted during the interim
 
01:48:44.159 --> 01:48:44.950 align:start position:0%
which last year voted during the interim
study

01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
votes to to uh
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
ask representative schamberg to bring
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
back his bills so that we could have
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
this discussion in
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we are going to be we did retain the
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
bill and we are going to be
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
discussing it i'm not whenever the chair
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
desires i just thought it would be good
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
to have that report
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
out so people would have a
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
kind of cliff's notes to the whole
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
discussion before we started bringing
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
back people
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so we can send that report out
 
01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.790 align:start position:0%
thank you so we can send that report out
to

01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
all the members of representative
 
01:49:30.639 --> 01:49:35.910 align:start position:0%
all the members of representative
romney

01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're muted i think i think he had her
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
hand up first
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
i know it couldn't minus go ahead
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
oh okay i just want to go back to uh
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry and um a
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
potential amendment with uh
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative schomburg
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
so first thing i guess we once that is
 
01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
created we should
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
have that scored by finance as to what
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
the impact is is that
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
your intention uh walter well that
 
01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
certainly makes sense yes
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'll need your coaching on the process
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
my first time doing it
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
well we just have to ask them that's all
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
it won't be it won't be difficult but
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that the federal
 
01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:17.270 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that the federal
gov

01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
gov
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
the feds when they were doing this when
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
they let the federal legislature was
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
that this was debated whether there
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
should be this
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
second uh stimulus if you will because
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's what it is
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
and uh they went back and forth but then
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
they they agreed yes let's
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
let's do this second thing which was yes
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
deductions were always going to be there
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the expenses
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
but then at the last minute they added
 
01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.390 align:start position:0%
but then at the last minute they added
in

01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that if a loan is forgiven
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
that it not be treated as revenue
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
so uh that's what we're debating here is
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
should that be
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
considered as revenue or not uh
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
basically it's
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
cash that came in but when it comes to
 
01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:01.750 align:start position:0%
cash that came in but when it comes to
the

01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
you know you have your books right you
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
have revenue you have expense
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
you subtract the two you get profit the
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
profit's what's taxed
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
so what we're debating here is whether
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
forgiven revenue that forgiven
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh loan be treated as revenue
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
or not and uh so if we take it out
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
obviously uh in theory
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh the profits are going to be be less
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
so yes it is it is the
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
double benefit to those companies and uh
 
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
i think again it was a the legislature
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
the federal legislature was aware that
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
it was a double benefit
 
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
and they did and they decided to do it
 
01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:44.629 align:start position:0%
and they did and they decided to do it
now

01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
and i to me there's no question i think
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do now is
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
understand what the total financial
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
impact and i would say it's going to
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
come in in the 100 million
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
range um you know we're still waiting to
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
hear from the dra
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
um and there's a whole bunch of
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
variables here
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be considering you know
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
if the if the uh 91.9
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
trillion dollar program whatever we're
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
getting out of that
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're allowed to offset this
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
then it becomes less of an issue with
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
100 million
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
it appears that we have enough revenue
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
coming in this year to
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
help offset that as well so
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
i i think this is going to boil down to
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
a political decision at the end
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
because we could be right but then we
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
could be wrong by being right
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
is my interpretation of it you know we
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
we could have all the arguments of why
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
this may not be a good idea
 
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
but um and i think senator bradley
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
expressed it the best he obviously his
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
was a political
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
the senate's calculus was political
 
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
when i asked him when i asked him well
 
01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:55.910 align:start position:0%
when i asked him when i asked him well
well

01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
did you have do you have a problem with
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
the 91
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
whatever it was million or did the
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
senate have any problem
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
and they said no we didn't even have a
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
problem with 135 million
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
they thought that that was doable so to
 
01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:09.270 align:start position:0%
they thought that that was doable so to
me

01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
it was in uh in the world of uh
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
how do we want to treat our businesses
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
how it's going to be perceived it's more
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
perception than
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh the numbers at this point but that's
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
just my opinion we'll talk about it next
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
tuesday again
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
on wednesday probably but i think that's
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
where we're at with this
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
um and i think each of us is going to
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
as to um you know
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we first thing we have to do is
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
agree to the numbers
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
that dra has given us and that's that's
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
not over they're still working them
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh and then we have to make a decision
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
whether we think we can absorb that and
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh given our
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
current revenues that are coming in and
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
what we think of
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
next year uh and and we have to make
 
01:53:58.639 --> 01:53:59.910 align:start position:0%
next year uh and and we have to make
evaluate

01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know how our businesses
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that it's not every
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
business are going to proceed
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm long-winded on this but um
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's where i think we're adam with
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay before i go to
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative tucker is that
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
on senate bill three we're going to deal
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
with the data
 
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
and we should make a decision based on
 
01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:27.430 align:start position:0%
and we should make a decision based on
that

01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
and then anything if then if
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
above our pay grade disagree with them
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
and they will let us know
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to make a decision
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
what we think is best for the state of
 
01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the data representative
 
01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:52.310 align:start position:0%
relative to the data representative
tucker

01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
tucker
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes i had a very simple question could
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
could you just tell us again
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
which day next week if any you think
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be having executive session
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
i don't plan on having any executive
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
session next year
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
what we got from the office
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
said that wednesday was a day that we
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
could expect
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
executive sessions to take place but
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure because i have to
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
step out for
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
a bit yeah at this point in time i
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
do not plan to have any executive
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
sessions next week
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of time between
 
01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:31.990 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of time between
then

01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the 26.
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much but what i want what
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
i expect on
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
on tuesday when we do the work sessions
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
is that we come out of it identifying
 
01:55:45.599 --> 01:55:45.990 align:start position:0%
is that we come out of it identifying
those

01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
bills that we have enough information so
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
that when we have an executive session
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
we can vote on it
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
and those bills that we don't have
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
enough information who do we call back
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
and those bills that there's two
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
amendments coming up for two bills and
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
if that
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
is satisfactory then we're all set on
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
that too
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
and uh that said and then on wednesday
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
that would be to
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
pick up revenue issues
 
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
great good i i thought that's what you
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
said and then when i saw the agenda
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
i just thought i'd check right
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
they always put that on there just in
 
01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:32.470 align:start position:0%
they always put that on there just in
case

01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if there's going to
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
be an executive session i will let you
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
know ahead of time
 
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative element thank you
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
i want to get back to the sb
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
3. i think that that
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very important
 
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we have something like what
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
is talking about that makes it clear
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we are not going to be in the
 
01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:06.390 align:start position:0%
that we are not going to be in the
business

01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
in future of on making all federal
 
01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:11.270 align:start position:0%
in future of on making all federal
grants

01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
grants
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
tax-free that would pretty much kill us
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
um but there are two other things there
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
is that on i checked the attendees
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
and there wasn't anybody from dra
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
present and i think that
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
we ought to share with them that on
 
01:57:34.510 --> 01:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
the security uh the uh
 
01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.550 align:start position:0%
the security uh the uh
[Music]

01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
employment security department has got
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
some interesting information on ppp that
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
and the second one is
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
i think probably we would not be allowed
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
to do this by our constitution
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
but the first part of
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
the uh ppp grants the larger part of it
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
did not include any requirement as
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
brian gottlobe was saying
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
to show that you'd experience some kind
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
of loss
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic and so a lot of
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
businesses that
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
really didn't have a loss on applied for
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
it and got it
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
and they were frequently the ones that
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
got it first because
 
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
they had banking relationships that were
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
better than the rest
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
on and if we're talk if
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
the federal government considered this
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
as a stimulus and if we're talking
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
about uh accepting it as a stimulus
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
the state will also do which i think is
 
01:58:48.719 --> 01:58:49.109 align:start position:0%
the state will also do which i think is
the

01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
issue on is there a way
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
that we could require that the criteria
 
01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:55.990 align:start position:0%
that we could require that the criteria
that

01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
are in the second part of
 
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
ppp applied
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
to the first part i don't know whether
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
that would be too difficult for us to
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
manage administratively
 
01:59:11.229 --> 01:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know what at this point whether
 
01:59:11.239 --> 01:59:12.550 align:start position:0%
i don't know what at this point whether
constitutionally

01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
 
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
we could do that but it would
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
limit it to the companies that really
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
needed to keep that money that
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
that spent it all and didn't get any
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
profits during that period
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
and are trying to stay alive yeah
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
we need more clarity on both
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
types of stimulus what the rules were
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
because brian said something
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
that contrary to what i thought because
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
i thought the first people
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
take tpp loans
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
i know a friend of mine said that they
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
weren't eligible because they started in
 
02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
november and they made less so that's
 
02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
contrary to what
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
he said that was actually true
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
that's a different group that's the
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
group that started
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
on up businesses too late for
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
but the the other one is all of the
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
businesses that
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
are still just barely alive at this
 
02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:29.910 align:start position:0%
are still just barely alive at this
point

02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
that were in fairly decent shape before
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
on that did not thrive during the
 
02:00:37.679 --> 02:00:38.790 align:start position:0%
on that did not thrive during the
pandemic

02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
that they had to close down for long
 
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
periods of time they didn't get revenue
 
02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:47.250 align:start position:0%
we had one testimony about that
 
02:00:47.250 --> 02:00:48.790 align:start position:0%
we had one testimony about that
[Music]

02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
and there are there were i think quite a
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
few of them
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
and a number of them did manage to get
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
ppp loans
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
more of them probably in the second wave
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
but in the first
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
wave which was three quarters of the
 
02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:03.510 align:start position:0%
wave which was three quarters of the
money

02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
two thirds of the money on
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
the the loans went first to the
 
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
companies that had good banking
 
02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:13.030 align:start position:0%
companies that had good banking
relationships

02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
and those were more the ones that
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
that did pretty well during the pandemic
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
and don't really need
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
so the question is whether
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
we would be able both
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
constitutionally and administratively to
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
to apply that and make sure
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we were mirroring the federal
 
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:41.510 align:start position:0%
that we were mirroring the federal
intent

02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
if not their law in terms of providing a
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
stimulus to the ones that
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise were going to die and that
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
may be going to die if they have to pay
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
taxes when they didn't have any revenue
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
we can't change the rules that the
 
02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:01.589 align:start position:0%
we can't change the rules that the
government

02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
puts on these things but we need to
 
02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.189 align:start position:0%
puts on these things but we need to
understand

02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
what they are and how they differ from
 
02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:08.310 align:start position:0%
what they are and how they differ from
one

02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
group to the other and then
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
when they did get the stimulus did they
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
follow the rules we don't know that you
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
have to depend upon
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
the small business association or
 
02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:24.870 align:start position:0%
the small business association or
whoever

02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
then i guess we're all set until next
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
tuesday and what i would do is i'd come
 
02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:49.750 align:start position:0%
tuesday and what i would do is i'd come
in

02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
thursday review those seven bills
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
and be ready
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
also review the two amendments
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
i i haven't heard of any other other oh
 
02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:06.229 align:start position:0%
i i haven't heard of any other other oh
yeah

02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll have the amendment
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
from representative spillsbury and
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
representatives chamber
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
all right thanks everybody i thought
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
today was
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
