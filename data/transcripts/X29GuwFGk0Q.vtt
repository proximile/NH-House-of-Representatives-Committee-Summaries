00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
several delays
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
along the way um
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
we also had heard from
 
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh people who
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
testified uh that there was a need
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
to have the uh
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
the guidelines um updated in a number of
 
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.309 align:start position:0%
the guidelines um updated in a number of
ways

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
also was that a variant your audio is
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
coming in hardcore
 
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.790 align:start position:0%
coming in hardcore
uh

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh supreme court decisions
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
which made it impossible for
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
um for the uh for there to be
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
any sort of adjustment for
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
equal or
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh shared shared
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
time uh among the parents
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
so all of this uh suggests that
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
yes there is a need for uh
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation in the
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
future um taking into account
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
all of the issues that are brought up
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
both in the supreme court decisions
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
is transmitting better now
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
not really uh i is there any other
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%

residential responsibility
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative desimone thank you
 
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.190 align:start position:0%

again

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
chairman long and it's nice to see
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
everybody i miss all of you
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
from the way i see it um the residential
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
um shared responsibilities
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
is growing um i think that this
 
00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:38.870 align:start position:0%
is growing um i think that this
legislation

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
is necessary does it need to be fixed
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps so however i think that this
 
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
perhaps so however i think that this
legislation

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.190 align:start position:0%
legislation
is

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
an excellent starting point i think that
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
if we refer it to uh or recommend
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
it for future legislation it's the way
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
i think that it will help a lot of
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
families who are in
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
great distress right now um like many of
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%

hi uh yes thank you um mr chairman
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
i definitely think that we need to
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
propose future legislation
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
so much so that i've actually already
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
drafted some
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
trying to incorporate some of the uh
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
language that
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
the was suggested by the unh study
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i've sent that to all of your guys's
 
00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.269 align:start position:0%
and i've sent that to all of your guys's
email

beginning of this meeting
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
so i think that uh
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully that can be a basis for
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
some discussion either you know in the
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
in the near future to potentially
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
move this uh forward as soon as possible
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
in the next session so thank you

session on house bill 1278
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
and uh if representative carson could
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
just give us
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
a brief overview of his communication
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
christina did you send that out to
 
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
christina did you send that out to
everybody

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
where she she just emailed the to the
 
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.190 align:start position:0%
where she she just emailed the to the
committee

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay i thought i had sent him out also
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
but briefly i mean this is regarding
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
the importance of managing psychotropic
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
medications and foster children
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
in an appropriate way and the bill
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
grew directly out of uh
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
i believe an inspector general report
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
it found that new hampshire was one of
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
the states that in particular
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
had problems with what they defined as
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medication use in foster
 
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.669 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medication use in foster
children

00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
part of the statistics were influenced
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
by the fact that many states use
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
information gathering systems that don't
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
separate separate out foster children
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
from children that are also part of the
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
system and new hampshire combines them
 
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.470 align:start position:0%
system and new hampshire combines them
both

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
so that is a statistical
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
influence on the final number but i
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that that
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
is really what's significant what's
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
significant is
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
that the intent of
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
the bill which is to involve the
 
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.029 align:start position:0%
the bill which is to involve the
legislature

00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
in prescribing practices
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
has a very major flaw
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
and it's also ill-timed the
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
dcyf is moving ahead
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
with a very organized plan
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
that i outlined in the information that
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
i set out
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
that is a plan that involves regional
 
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.149 align:start position:0%
that is a plan that involves regional
nurses

00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the state working with the
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
relatively small
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
population of foster children who were
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
eating psychotropic medicines
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
and even smaller population of providers
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
would you ask um mr rep carson
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
to speak loudly louder his volume seems
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
to be down for my
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
is that any better match ah life is good
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
um so uh whatever you did here
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the previous stuff i think it was
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
sort of an on-ramp more than anything
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
and the real essentials are that this is
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
an important issue
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that exists everywhere in
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
the country it's an issue that's been
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
driven primarily by lack of resources
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
lack of training and lack of supervision
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
and it is something that the state of
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is doing a good job right
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
now addressing
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
through dcyf's effort to have nurses
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the regions of the state working
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
directly with the prescribers
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
and also working directly with
 
00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:16.710 align:start position:0%
and also working directly with
professional

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
board certified child psychiatrists who
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
is out of the sununu center
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
who now has it as part of the contract
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
for that person to be the direct
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
supervisor for
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
the regional nurses that are monitoring
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
the use of the medication
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
and to be an available resource for
 
00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:36.789 align:start position:0%
and to be an available resource for
actual

00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
consultation about medication use with
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
the prescribers
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
because one of the problems is there's a
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
shortage of
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
child psychiatrists and there's a
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
shortage of
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
any prescriber with significant
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
prescribing experience
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
but it's a small population of
 
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.870 align:start position:0%
but it's a small population of
prescribers

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
prescribers
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
and they are well connected with the
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
dcyf system that's being put in place
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that what we would better do
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
committee would be ask dcyf
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
to give us a report about every six
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
months or so
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
about the progress of the nurses in
 
00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:15.430 align:start position:0%
about the progress of the nurses in
place

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the cases they're reviewing and any
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
issues that they
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
are experiencing and what they might
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
need to correct those issues
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
because the issues have a lot to do with
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
inadequate record-keeping
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
inadequate diagnostic criteria and
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
inadequate then monitoring of target
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
symptoms that the psychotropics are
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
useful for
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
and those are really critical issues and
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
if dcyf
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
can't show progress in two years i think
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
there may well be
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
reason for there to be something
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
different in the way of legislation
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's also the issue that pcyf
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
leadership changes
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
and a problem that's high on their list
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
could fall low on their list
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
at which point it would be important for
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature to make it clear
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
this needs to remain high on the list
 
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.750 align:start position:0%
this needs to remain high on the list
however

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of legislation without funding
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
is useless
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
so the future may well call for
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
legislation if dcyf
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
isn't able to pull things ahead but
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
that's legislation that should be
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
adequately funded
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
and it should not be legislation that
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
follows the present
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
bill because it has significant flaws in
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
how it defines
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medicines how it defines
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
diagnostic criteria
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
and also how it turns to the boards of
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
medicine and nursing
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
to give them brand new duties which they
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't have and they shouldn't have
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
to be telling people how to prescribe
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
because the legislature is telling
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
people how to prescribe
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
the boards of medicine and the boards of
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
nursing are already available
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
to consult with any organization that's
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
putting together
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines about guidelines that would
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
be appropriate
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
and then it's the board of medicine and
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing's job
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
to respond to complaints which can come
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
from any agency
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
about whether or not these guidelines
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
are being followed
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
but the legislature should not be in the
 
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.510 align:start position:0%
but the legislature should not be in the
business

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
of ordering specific prescribing
 
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.269 align:start position:0%
of ordering specific prescribing
practices

00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
or making it an additional duty which
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
would be unprecedented
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
for either of those boards to be
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
involved directly
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
in the creation of guidelines about a
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
specific class of medicine
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
it opens the door to further such
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
specific classes of medicine
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's not where the profession wants to
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
go that's not where the legislation
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to go it doesn't work
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
things change too fast
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we should move ahead
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
with further legislation at this time
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
and don't recommend that
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
but i think the child and family law
 
00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:57.990 align:start position:0%
but i think the child and family law
committee

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
can work with the dcyf to assess whether
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
something's emerging that is an issue
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
that does need
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
a different legislative approach
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%

okay thank you uh the final bill we have
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
this morning i'll open up the work group

full committee workgroup on house bill
 
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
full committee workgroup on house bill
1595.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
the issues i saw in this this this
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
this bill um this bill requires courts
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
to oh yeah we can't do this
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
um sorry uh yeah i recommend that that
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
it was just it in my opinion it was just
 
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:47.590 align:start position:0%
it was just it in my opinion it was just
too

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
open-ended i mean we don't know if the
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
child already had an evaluation
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh and we'd be requiring them to pay for
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
another evaluation
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i i do believe that it's
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
the parents responsibility to uh see
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
fit whether their child needs an
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation for
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder or mental health
 
00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:16.149 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder or mental health
um

00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't i wouldn't recommend it as
 
00:29:18.399 --> 00:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't i wouldn't recommend it as
further

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh in my opinion rep representative
 
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh in my opinion rep representative
desimone

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
desimone
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman long um i agree
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think that um since the courts already
 
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.029 align:start position:0%
i think that um since the courts already
have

00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
for children to receive
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
mental health uh minor children
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh to to get involved with mental health
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
and to get involved with um
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
rehab i think that to
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
immediately send them to a facility
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
such as the sununu center could inhibit
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
their second bite of the apple as it
 
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.350 align:start position:0%
their second bite of the apple as it
were

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes just referring them for uh
 
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.350 align:start position:0%
sometimes just referring them for uh
psychological

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
psychological
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
help and rehab is enough to put them
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
on the road to recovery and that's
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
i think where we need to be headed is
 
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:23.430 align:start position:0%
i think where we need to be headed is
recovery

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative rice did you have any
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
further i did i
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
i just think that we can't take a
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all approach
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think that you know each individual
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
case should be
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
handled on its own merits and not just
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
lumped in all together
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
in the bill file which is at the state

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
that right
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
and can um does anybody have a
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh a summary of why
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
the uh co-sponsored the sponsors and the
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors thought this was a
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
good bill yeah if i if my memory serves
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
me correct they felt this was a good
 
00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:42.950 align:start position:0%
me correct they felt this was a good
bill

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
because they felt that the court shall
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
take action on a child who's had three
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
or more
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
is it three or more convictions uh three
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
or more prior convictions that
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
they would be required to
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
um get um
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
evaluated for mental health or substance
 
00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:05.590 align:start position:0%
evaluated for mental health or substance
abuse

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know and they felt that that would
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a benefit to the state
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
and for the children so if i'm if
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
i'm 15 and i'm showing up in court again
 
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.110 align:start position:0%
i'm 15 and i'm showing up in court again
for

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
a drinking violation under age drinking
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
and this is my fourth time showing up in
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
court they feel that i should be
 
00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:28.549 align:start position:0%
court they feel that i should be
evaluated

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
um i should be evaluated for substance
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%

you can hear me i don't think can you
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%

00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on uh house bill
 
00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:14.230 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on uh house bill
15.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
okay if we can if we can mute
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative variant
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
poor scam representative long would it
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
be helpful if i pulled the bill up and
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
shared it so folks could look at it very
 
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.190 align:start position:0%
shared it so folks could look at it very
quickly

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
we want to move on yeah
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
representative st john yeah i think
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're good
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative st john i i was just
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
going to add
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
something to um um what representative
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
mulligan was saying
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
and i although i i see the
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill i think it has to be
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
done on an individual basis on an
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
individual case and it shouldn't be a
 
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
individual case and it shouldn't be a
precedent

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
precedent
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
across the board every situation is
 
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.150 align:start position:0%
across the board every situation is
different

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
and we would hope that the courts would
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
evaluate repeat offenders with that in
 
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.270 align:start position:0%
evaluate repeat offenders with that in
mind

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
and not make a a a blanket bill
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
requiring that so that's just in
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
response to
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
what representative mulligan was saying
 
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.510 align:start position:0%
what representative mulligan was saying
right

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
no and i understand i mean because i may
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
have been evaluated in my fourth case in
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
court i may have
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
been evaluated on my second case
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
however this bill will last that i get
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
evaluated again
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
um you know so you're absolutely right
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
it's on an individual basis
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative simone
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman long again i agree
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
with what you're saying
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it takes up to five times
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh for anyone albeit a
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
child or an adult to go through
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation and to really
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
absorb any uh
 
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.349 align:start position:0%
absorb any uh
psychiatric

00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
distance that they're getting so for to
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
lump it all together and say
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
you go to court um and it's because of
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse or drug abuse that's it
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to be incarcerated it
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
the needs of everyone it only fits the
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
needs of
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
one or two maybe more
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
but again we can't it's not a one size
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
fits all as
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative rice said thank you for
