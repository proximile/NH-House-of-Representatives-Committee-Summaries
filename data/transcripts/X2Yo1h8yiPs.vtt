this bill first and with that I'd like
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
to introduce myself to you I am
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative Mary Beth walls I
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
represent Merrimack District number 23
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of Beau and Dunbarton
 
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
along with representative Woods we share
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
a district
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
um so this bill came from a constituent
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
request and as you all know we kind of
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
all live in small town America and as it
 
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
worked out when I was campaigning last
 
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
fall I first spoke with the patients
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
family and then with the patient's
 
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.629 align:start position:0%
family and then with the patient's
doctor

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
and they all asked for the same thing so
 
00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
I said sure I can put a bill on on this
 
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
and that's the bill that you have before
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
you and you will later hear from both
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
the patient's family
 
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
um Mrs Fortier and the Doctor Who is
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
named Dr call both of whom should be in
 
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
the waiting room on this to testify as
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
well but with that let me introduce the
 
00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:52.459 align:start position:0%
bill and tell you a little bit about it
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it extends the
 
00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
length of time for a renewal on a
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for add from 60 days to 90
 
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.990 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for add from 60 days to 90
days

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:05.459 align:start position:0%
um and what that means for the patients
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
and for the doctors is that it goes from
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
six co-pays a year to four co-pays a
 
00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.350 align:start position:0%
six co-pays a year to four co-pays a
year

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
now it turns out that uh health
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
insurance companies don't prorate
 
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.870 align:start position:0%
insurance companies don't prorate
co-pays

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
co-pays
 
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
so let's say your copay is a hundred
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
dollars if you've got a 60-day
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
prescription you pay the hundred dollars
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
if you've got a 90-day prescription you
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
pay the hundred dollars so you're going
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
from uh by going from six co-pays to
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
four co-pays you're saving at least out
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
of pocket a third of the cost of the
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
drugs for the patients
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you all know there is a
 
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
shortage of psychiatrists in this state
 
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
and there's an especially acute shortage
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
of child psychiatrists and Dr call is
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
just that a child's psychiatrist and for
 
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
them to have to write that many more
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
prescriptions is really onerous and in
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
some cases they have to patients have to
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
physically pick up the prescriptions so
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
they have to coordinate with the doctor
 
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
to actually physically receive the
 
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.630 align:start position:0%
to actually physically receive the
prescription

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
I know that this rule is inconsistent
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
with all the other drugs that patients
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
are taking the other drugs that they
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
take are on 90 day renewals including
 
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
things like Xanax which is even far more
 
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
dangerous than these kinds of drugs that
 
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of ironic because it's
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
particularly difficult for this illness
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
patients who have ADD have difficulties
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
with executive functioning which means
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
prescription renewal they're often not
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
organized enough to repeatedly order
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
refills on time so they don't run out
 
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
this extends the time between refills it
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
gives them better options to doing that
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
and it requires fewer refills so there's
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
less times less opportunities they have
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
to miss getting a refill
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure why this drug was
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
changed from 90 days to 60 days but I
 
00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:56.579 align:start position:0%
have a suspicion that had to do with the
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis but you will hear from Dr
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
call that really whether somebody has a
 
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459 align:start position:0%
60-day supply or a 90-day Supply does
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
not influence whether or not somebody's
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
likely to try and sell these to their
 
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.610 align:start position:0%
likely to try and sell these to their
friends

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
friends
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
um and so that extending this to 90 days
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
is unlikely to have any effect on
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
whether the patient tries tries to do
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
um drugs are expensive and refills are
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
frankly we all know a pain in the neck
 
00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:28.019 align:start position:0%
I'm asking with this legislation that
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
you please support these patients help
 
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:32.420 align:start position:0%
these patients and pass this Bill
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to need to be told who has
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
hands up because I don't I see any
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
and that's probably because she did such
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
a good job
 
00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
a state representative Chris Schultz
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
ready to speak as well I I have the list
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
of people who wish to speak thank you uh
 
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
because I don't usually but thank you
 
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
for that rep I do see a hand
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative for taking this question
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
can you explain
 
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
um why there's a distinction made
 
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.230 align:start position:0%
um why there's a distinction made
um for

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
describing the same kinds of medication
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
for narcolepsy as opposed to attention
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
deficit disorder
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
only was for ADHD subsequently I was
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
talking to Dr Collins she looked at the
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill and looked at the law and said oh I
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
should have asked you to do it for
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
narcolepsy too and she said the same
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
issues apply but given that the request
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
to me was only for add that was all I
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I want to follow that up myself and
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
ask representative Waltz if someone from
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
our committee brought forth an amendment
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
to ask narcolepsy would you uh be okay
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be completely supportive
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
of it all right
 
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you so much
 
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
therefore we will hold the bill for
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
executing when we get to the end of this
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
so that can be brought forth perhaps by
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
next week anyone else on the committee
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:37.139 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative and
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
have a good exact session thank you
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're welcome chair now calls
 
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.730 align:start position:0%
you're welcome chair now calls
um

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:42.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz who has signed up
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
can you hear me we can oh great thank
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and to the committee I'll
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
be very brief uh I also heard from
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
constituents who were very excited about
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
um they are two adults that are a couple
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
and uh has they've said almost verbatim
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
What representative Waltz said that it's
 
00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339 align:start position:0%
a cruel irony that there are extra Hoops
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
put up for people who have ADHD that
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
affects executive functioning uh because
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
the very medication that helps you with
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
executive functioning and the ability to
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
pick up the medication more frequently
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
is exactly the hoop that you're jumping
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
through so
 
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
um I am here on their behalf I don't
 
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
know that I can answer any of your
 
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
questions other than uh I know that one
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
of the the the female of this couple has
 
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:48.380 align:start position:0%
been taking Adderall for 14 years
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
and has shown consistency in her
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
prescription and except for the times
 
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
when it's been difficult to pick it up
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
because of the hoops and to have this
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
made available like the rest of her
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for a 90-day Supply would
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
enable her to only have those sorts of
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hoops uh you know this at the same rate
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
she has her other medication so this
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful to many people who
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
suffer from an affect disorder that
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
affects executive functioning thank you
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Schultz
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%

the chair would now like to call Dr
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%

um absolutely I think um

um representative walls really she
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
really nailed to the heart of what this
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
is all about and that is making sure
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
that that we have
 
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
um Equitable
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
um treatment for this medication that
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
has been absolutely life-changing for a
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
number of folks who are struggling with
 
00:16:26.459 --> 00:16:28.030 align:start position:0%
number of folks who are struggling with
ADHD

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
ADHD
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
ADHD is one of those
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
um those what can be a very debilitating
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
and can lead to all sorts of if
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
untreated all sorts of risks to academic
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
social emotional problems self-esteem
 
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
um you know seeing um folks seeing
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
themselves as being lazy uh not able to
 
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
get tasks done untreated it certainly
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
can lead to more more job performance
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
for issues for adults marital and family
 
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
issues we know that the um the
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
likelihood of having a negative effect
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
it goes up it's at least twice for those
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
who are untreated for for things like
 
00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
likelihood to use substances to try to
 
00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:16.730 align:start position:0%
likelihood to use substances to try to
self-treat

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
self-treat
 
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
um this is this is for folks who are not
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
treated the folks who are treated
 
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.150 align:start position:0%
treated the folks who are treated
um

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
are much more likely to to be right
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
online with with their peers who do not
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
have ADHD so when treated these meds are
 
00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:36.419 align:start position:0%
extremely beneficial social to to even
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
the playing field in terms of some of
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
the risks in my experience I have not
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
seen any downside to having a 90-day
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
scripts which I prior to being in New
 
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.470 align:start position:0%
scripts which I prior to being in New
Hampshire

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
um was you know was the case where it
 
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
was a federal law I've not seen you know
 
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
I'm very careful about diagnosing and
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
prescribing and I've seen the just the
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
the the benefits of um
 
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.220 align:start position:0%
of this these medications for treating
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
ADHD and the frustrations to both the
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
prescribers the and most of all the
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
patients when
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
um you know when the the meds are not in
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
line you know both the cost
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
um of paying for a a 90-day script but
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
getting a 60 or having to go to the
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
local pharmacy and paying the higher
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
co-pay every 30 days most of the
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are not rec they're
 
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
not recognizing a 60-day script they
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
either want the 90 for chronic mids or
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
30. you know so it becomes this this
 
00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
whole enormous difficulty to
 
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
um to overcome
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
um I am thrilled to be
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
to be here and I thank you for your all
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
of your time
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
um and understanding about that
 
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.190 align:start position:0%
um and understanding about that
um

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
what I find is that when when patients
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
are on these medications and stabilized
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
that there's not you know that they they
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
do well this there is
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
um huge positive benefit and there is no
 
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
negative to receiving a 90-day
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
um Beyond 60. I also appreciate that um
 
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
the bringing up of the the neurology I
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
since I don't prescribe as a
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist I don't prescribe for
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
narcolepsy I refer I'm in the same board
 
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
but that's not that's not my area
 
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:30.419 align:start position:0%
um it it just didn't dawn on me when
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
when um Mary Beth walls and I were
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
speaking but um but I absolutely agree
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
that you know anything we can do to to
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
make this um better a better experience
 
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
for those of our fellow New Hampshire
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
residents I think would be fantastic
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
will you take questions absolutely Dr
 
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.510 align:start position:0%
will you take questions absolutely Dr
Shapiro

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Dr
 
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.470 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Dr
Paul

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
Paul
 
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.590 align:start position:0%
Paul
um

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
is it true that there are some people
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
who are treated for attention deficit
 
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:06.740 align:start position:0%
disorder with non-stimulant medications
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
and if so if so is that an issue
 
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:13.340 align:start position:0%
um for them in terms of the length of
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
prescription no there's um they are
 
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:19.940 align:start position:0%
allowed so some of the non-non stimulant
 
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
medications are meds like intuitive
 
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
which is in the blood pressure class
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's long-acting guanfacine meds like
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
Strattera those meds are 90-day scripts
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
and they actually are allowed refills
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
the stimulants were currently limited to
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
60 days and there are no refills allowed
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes sir
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
um I can assume this from your comments
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
but I probably should have asked before
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
I offered to write an amendment
 
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.789 align:start position:0%
I offered to write an amendment
um

00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
do I take it that you don't see any
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
contraindications or dangers for making
 
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:56.900 align:start position:0%
the same change for narcolepsy
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think there would be no
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
contraindications and I think this would
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
be it enormously helpful for narcolepsy
 
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
um to have to have scripts aligned with
 
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
the other medications which is very
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question for the doctor uh
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
where is your practice based so I'm in
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
Concord I live in BO I'm in Concord I'm
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
at Concord Behavioral Health okay I'm 89
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
North State Street thank you I asked
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
that because I'm looking for
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
um a child and for an adult psychiatrist
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
to refer some of our patients to and as
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
has been testified you're very thin on
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
and absolutely true my so just a very
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
brief background I started off teaching
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
math I taught everything from seventh
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
grade through calculus
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I loved it I absolutely loved what I
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
what I did
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
um but I also saw the effects of not
 
00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:00.350 align:start position:0%
um but I also saw the effects of not
treating

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
treating
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
um in childhood for a number of
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
different reasons whether it's anxiety
 
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
ADHD you know or a number of other
 
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
factors trauma
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
um and so so I went to med school
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
um and because I I finally I reached the
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
point where I said you know there's I
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
have I'm a parent and a grandparent
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
there's there's no place for these kids
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
to go and there there's just such a huge
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
shortage I either have to
 
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
you know to to knowing that I could do
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
it I needed to do it
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
um well I wasn't sure I could do it but
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
I did
 
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
um and um because there is such a huge
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
shortage and I do my very best to
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
um to try to keep the door open as much
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
as I can so that new patients aren't
 
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
left without a place to go
 
00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:48.539 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your service thank
 
00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:49.970 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your service thank

00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else uh who wishes to
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
testify that is not on my list they
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman this is representative walls
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%

at her name and totally not
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
comprehending um I should not say this
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
in this company uh
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
are you several scripts will be written
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
and sent in I'm sorry Joanne 48 please
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes we can thank you for
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
coming to testify wonderful I appreciate
 
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
you taking the time to hear what I have
 
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
to say my teenage son has ADHD
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
he's been on medication for seven years
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
it is tremendously helpful in managing
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
his schoolwork and his Focus his ability
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
to stay on task
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
the change in the law would simply
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
enable us to get prescriptions less
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
frequently and it's not just the co-pays
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
but the time it takes to manage getting
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
the prescription at the appropriate time
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
not too early so as it can't be refilled
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
but not too late so that he runs out so
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
I greatly appreciate your your
 
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
willingness to consider this bill
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
we're happy to help any questions for
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you for coming and
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
thank the representative for this bill
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
and representative Shapiro for going to
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
get an amendment and
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
wanting to testify
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
then I will bring this hearing to a
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
close on Bill 582. we will hope to
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
I now open the hearing on House Bill one
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
four three
 
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative our own representative
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
Merchant and would you introduce your
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill please and I believe an amendment
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
that's true Mr chairman
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
I come before the committee of Health
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and elderly Affairs
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
and colleagues public members my name is
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
Gary Merchant representative from
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County District 4.
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
Claremont Ward 2. before you today is
 
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
House Bill 143 there are three distinct
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
sections to the bill
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
the first one regards to e-prescribing
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
what they call electronic prescribing
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
the middle one is dealing with a
 
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:01.940 align:start position:0%
provision in the Consumer Protection Law
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
dealing with software vendors that have
 
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
a tendency to violate their
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
um what they're doing within the
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
software functionality used by
 
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
prescribers or by clinicians and also a
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
requirement for the data
 
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
that's supplied by the pharmacy that the
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
data also includes a data element to
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
help monitor
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
electronic prescribing so let me do the
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
first one with e-prescribing
 
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
e-prescribing is now required will be
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
required in January 2022 by the federal
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
government unfortunately the federal
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
government only deals with
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
prescriptions paid by Medicaid I've been
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
sorry Medicare Part D
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
so to address all prescriptions the law
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
the intent of it is to fill in the Gap
 
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:48.539 align:start position:0%
so it includes all prescriptions
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of the payment Source whether
 
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
it's Medicaid or commercial payer or
 
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.769 align:start position:0%
it's Medicaid or commercial payer or
cash

00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
cash
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
and many times when you're looking at
 
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.649 align:start position:0%
and many times when you're looking at
diversion

00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
diversion
 
00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:00.059 align:start position:0%
it's the cash paying customers that
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
create a lot of the problem with
 
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
diversion so by asking them to
 
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
electronically prescribe it does a
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
couple of things one is there's a better
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
data transmission between
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
the prescriber and the dispenser
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
going back to what we saw before
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
that we talked about with 582
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
with prescriptions one of the
 
00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
requirements is including
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
a diagnosis whether it's narcolepsy or
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
attention deficit disorder
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
that may have to be written on the
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
prescription if it's electronically
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
prescribed it could be placed in a note
 
00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
field and sent from the prescriber to
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
the dispenser to use to ensure they have
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
compliance with the law
 
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
secondly when you look at paper
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
prescriptions today
 
00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
many times it's a source of diversion a
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
paper lends itself easily to be
 
00:27:46.679 --> 00:27:47.870 align:start position:0%
paper lends itself easily to be
manipulated

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
manipulated
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
you can take something that has a five
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
and put a one in front of it to make 15
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
or take a number 50 make it a six and
 
00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
make it 60. so by having something
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
electronically prescribed the ability to
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
divert or to
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
change and manipulate written
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
description becomes less
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
of an issue and that's probably
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
primarily the reason why the federal
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
government through the sports Act
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
decided to have electronic prescribing
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
for Medicare Part D plans in the first
 
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.110 align:start position:0%
for Medicare Part D plans in the first
place

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
26 states in the country
 
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
um deal with this
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
and we're on the
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
I would say at this point in time is
 
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
probably another 10 in the in the fold
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
that will probably become
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
within the next year or so but one of
 
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
the things I want to also point out
 
00:28:39.169 --> 00:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
besides electronic prescribing in the
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill is the issue of something that came
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
to the attention in Vermont it was
 
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
practice fusion uh what practice fusion
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
did in their software this is before all
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
scripts bought them all scripts when
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
they bought them the lawsuit was filed
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
it was determined that built into the
 
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
algorithm used by clinicians
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
to assess patients was a functionality
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
to assess pain and if you had a certain
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
threshold it automatically
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
without any reason for the provider it
 
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
just generated what they call an opium
 
00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:12.419 align:start position:0%
treatment plan
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
and in the open treatment plan happened
 
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.430 align:start position:0%
and in the open treatment plan happened
by

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:29:18.769 --> 00:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
was a drug
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
for controls
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of that drug was also
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
providing a stipend to practice fusion
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
and what happened to the whole thing was
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
that the FDA I'm sorry the Department of
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Beaumont chapter did some
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
research and determined that the
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
software in fact was
 
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
steering providers in a direction
 
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
towards a product by the manufacturer so
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
what this law basically does is try to
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
allow in our state law in the consumer
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
protection act language to help prevent
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
that or at least if it happens we have
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
some language to go back and saying it
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have happened we can find him
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
take action against them
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
the third part in the law deals with
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
electronic prescription monitoring and
 
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.630 align:start position:0%
electronic prescription monitoring and
basically

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
if the pharmacy
 
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.059 align:start position:0%
sends to the prescription drug
 
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
monitoring program
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
the type of prescription used by the
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
prescriber whether it be e-prescribed
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
whether it be faxed
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
whether it be written or oral because
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions in the rule to
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
accommodate that
 
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:30.539 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
database in the prescription drug
 
00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
monitoring program
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
can then run reports for the licensing
 
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.950 align:start position:0%
can then run reports for the licensing
board

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
there is no penalty in this if we're
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
non-compliance but we're trying to allow
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
the licensing boards to look at where
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
they may have to spend some time
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
educationally to help prescribers
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
with e-rescribing and try to determine
 
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
what the barriers are to not doing the
 
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.990 align:start position:0%
what the barriers are to not doing the
e-prescribing

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
e-prescribing
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
and lastly in the amendment what came
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
before was the issue of the veterinarian
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
community and talking with
 
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
Dr Stephen Crawford and Dr Jane Roy
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
Barlow it came to my attention that
 
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
there is not really widely available if
 
00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
any at all software for a veterinarian
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
to e-prescribe so to ask the
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to e-prescribe when the
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
software the tools that are necessary to
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
do that didn't make sense so I wrote an
 
00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419 align:start position:0%
amendment to then exempt the
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and the way it's written
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
was modeled after the Arizona law
 
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
and in the Arizona law what they
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
basically said was it's up to the
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarians themselves the board of
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine to determine on an
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
annual basis
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
when the software becomes widely
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
available so the veterinarians are total
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
control over when to enact that
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
provision within the law
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
also it'll be prescribing a part of it
 
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
there are times in which if you look at
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
the exceptions
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
when the internet goes down
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
when a person's not able to get to the
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
internet you're on a phone call with a
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
provider the last thing you want to do
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
is delay therapy for a patient
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
flying therapy for a patient is not
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
healthy to them we're trying to find a
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
way to get a patient taken care of in a
 
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419 align:start position:0%
timely prompt manner so by allowing
 
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
exceptions in
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
the bill in the law
 
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:25.100 align:start position:0%
it does allow for those things to occur
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes it could be a simple thing
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
where you don't have access to the
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
internet not because it's not
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
functioning it's just wherever you're at
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
it there are parts of this world believe
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
it or not that you just cannot get
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
broadband internet it's amazing it does
 
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.269 align:start position:0%
broadband internet it's amazing it does
happen

00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
so this does allow for that flexibility
 
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.529 align:start position:0%
so this does allow for that flexibility
please

00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
to to allow the prescriber to have some
 
00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:48.419 align:start position:0%
options to opt out of it and because of
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to again delay the
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
patient getting treatment we don't want
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist in a position to try to
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
determine whether they have met the
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
exception or not so we exempt the farm
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
system trying to verify the use of an
 
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.970 align:start position:0%
system trying to verify the use of an
exception

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
exception
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
and take the honor of the person who's
 
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
doing the prescribing they use the
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
exception appropriately
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
so that's the intent of the laws is to
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
try to fill in the Gap around
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
CMS so it covers all providers
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
we did build in to the law into the bill
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
exceptions to deal with things that do
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
happen there's also a waiver requirement
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
so if a provider is a small provider in
 
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
office and does 50 prescriptions like a
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
pathologist radiologist they don't have
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
to comply they can get away from the
 
00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
licensing board we did deal with the
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
issue of practice infusion software
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
vendors that abuse their
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
their privileges or their software
 
00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.509 align:start position:0%
their privileges or their software
functionality

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
functionality
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
um not to the benefit of the patient but
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
to the benefit of themselves we also
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
built in there a way to monitor keep
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
prescribing through the data collection
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
with the prescription drug money program
 
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
to help the licensing boards identify
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
where they have to spend additional
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
resources whether it be educational or
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
whether it be Financial to help the
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
prescribers comply with e-prescribing
 
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
and that's the end of my testimony
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much to and any members
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
well until others do I have a couple uh
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
your excuse me Mr chair we uh Gary uh
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative Woods I believe raised
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
his hand okay I will get to him in a
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
minute I didn't I I've been scrolling
 
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:29.780 align:start position:0%
back and forth but I'll get to him next
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
and uh my my two questions uh I'm going
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
to assume the amendment which says
 
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
veterinarians don't have to do it if
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
they can't do it and the board of
 
00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine shall make the
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
determination I assume you've had good
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
conversations representative Merchant
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
with the veterinarians I've had
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
conversations with the veterinarians and
 
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
I talked to Dr Crawford he was going to
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
bring it to the veterinarian board which
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
I believe is tomorrow so I have not
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
heard back from the veterinarian board I
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
think in general the veterans likely to
 
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
be excluded completely
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's a wise thing for
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
us to do and that's why the amendment
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
was written the way it was is for the
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
Vets themselves to determine when they
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
should have the availability of the
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
tools if you will to do the job I must
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
confess that I skimmed too fast because
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
I saw that the part that said until they
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
can but the last line says they decide
 
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
yes the board of veterinary medicine
 
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
shall decide yeah I miss that okay thank
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
you and then the second question and
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
again I think I know the answer but I'd
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
rather have you tell me and and that is
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
the information set from the pharmacies
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
to the feds it's simply a percentage of
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
how many electronic prescriptions versus
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
not per provider or does it get into a
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail about what those
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
scripts are for
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
no it does not get into details of why
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
the prescription is written it's only
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
the format of the prescription that's it
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
so nobody could guess that Dr so and so
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
prescribes such and such for a certain
 
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.230 align:start position:0%
prescribes such and such for a certain
patient

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
correct the intent is that in the
 
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.950 align:start position:0%
correct the intent is that in the
database

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
that to be a report going to the
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
respective board and say Dr Pearson
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
has an 85 percent electronic fill rate
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
or Dr Woods only has 25. it goes to the
 
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
respective board whether it be a Board
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
of Medicine the board of dentistry the
 
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing to help them understand
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
where they may have to
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
um engage with the conversation try to
 
00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
determine how to get the percentage up
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
or maybe the person needs a waiver and
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
offer the waiver to them thank you very
 
00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
much representative Woods
 
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you uh
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant for taking my
 
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
question uh on page one line 21
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
um it's the references uh uh the the
 
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.770 align:start position:0%
um it's the references uh uh the the
board

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
um is is is that meant to be the
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
respective Board of a nurse practitioner
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
is prescribing that would be referred to
 
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
the nursing board if it's a physician
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
um and I was just wondering I I we I
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
think back way back away from this you
 
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
first brought this out I think we
 
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
brought that up did that need to be
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
clarified as to what board that is
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Woods um yes I remember
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
that conversation and I did not correct
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
it in the amendment I think it's the the
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
intent is it goes to the respective
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
licensing board but to add another word
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
in there saying to that effect I have no
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
issues whatsoever I think it just
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
any other question
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.930 align:start position:0%
or representative Merchant from our

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
um for the record I'm Paula minahan
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
Senior vice president for the New
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in the
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
state we are supportive of HB 143 and um
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
this is a very similar bill that was
 
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
passed out of your committee last year
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
which was House Bill 1332 but did not
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
make it over to the Senate due to the
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic
 
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
I want to make clear to this committee
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals in New Hampshire are
 
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
supportive of requiring electronic
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
prescribing for controlled substances
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
and the reasons for moving to electronic
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
prescribing for controlled substances
 
00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:50.579 align:start position:0%
are compelling I have submitted
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
testimony so I won't read
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
all of our reasons but just to um
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
highlight enhance the safety and quality
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
of the prescribing process reduces
 
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
errors and supports clinical decision
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
making along with um reducing theft and
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
increased security and um I think
 
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant did a great job
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
outlining the rest of the bill we're
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
really focused on the e-prescribing
 
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
piece and in fact many hospitals have
 
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
already implemented electronic
 
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:23.180 align:start position:0%
prescribing for Controlled Substances
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
several others are in the midst of doing
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
so as representative Merchant mentioned
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
it is a requirement of the federal
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
government for Medicare in about a year
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
less than a year so they're in the midst
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
of implementing that so we um we are
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
totally supportive of that provision and
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
we um thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:39:49.849 --> 00:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
testify in support of HB 143.
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you for your testimony
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair now recognizes Jane
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
Barlow Roy from the New Hampshire
 
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and would we bring up
 
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.609 --> 00:40:19.619 align:start position:0%
I had to find her in the list here
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
there's about 34 people so if people can
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
raise their hands that would make it a
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
bit easier
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
all set
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Dr Jane Barlow Roy I am
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
the representative to the New Hampshire
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Association I thank
 
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
you very much for letting me testify in
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
front of you guys today
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
um we are opposed to the bill as written
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
but we have been talking to
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant about the
 
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.750 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant about the
amendment

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I will make my testimony short
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
because representative Merchant has kind
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
of brought up all of our
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
um issues with the bill as far as there
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
is no software available
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
um currently
 
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
um widespread in the veterinary
 
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.630 align:start position:0%
um widespread in the veterinary
Community

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
Community
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
um uh the top kind of I would say five
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
Veterinary softwares out there do not
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
have any sort of e-prescribing
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
capabilities Technologies however you
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
want to call it
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so we don't have the capabilities of
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
of implementing
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
um you know such such a bill
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
um so we are willing to you know keep
 
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
updated on when such a uh software will
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
become available
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
um I have talked to
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
um our software provider named avamark
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
they're one of the top software
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
Veterinary softwares out there and they
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
actually said that they have no desire
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
to actually create
 
00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:50.099 align:start position:0%
um you know this this e-prescribing
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
software at the current moment
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
um they did not give me any timeline as
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
far as whether or not they will be
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
forced um you know on the federal level
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
to create something uh you know should
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
should it become more widespread
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
um but currently 13 other states do
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
exempt veterinarians
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I know that our language is and the
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
amendment was
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
modeled after uh in other states
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
um exemption but that's basically the
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
the juxt of my
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
um testimony today is is we do need some
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
sort of exemption um as veterinarians
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
because our software just does not exist
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
will the doctor take questions certainly
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you Dr
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
Roy for taking my question
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be very clear uh have
 
00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:43.859 align:start position:0%

it would apply to the veterinary
 
00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.690 align:start position:0%
it would apply to the veterinary
community

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
Merchant has been speaking with um Dr

00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
um but like I said any you know any
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
language that pertains to what goes on
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
after that and how it involves the board
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%

Nelson

00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:38.339 align:start position:0%
Nelson
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
yes uh what happens with the 13 states
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
who said do exempt it how about all the
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
other states what do they do
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not aware of what the other
 
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
currently doing
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
we you know it are in New Hampshire
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
um you know with our prescribing things
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
um we do tend to make calls into
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacies as far as those prescribing
 
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.030 align:start position:0%
pharmacies as far as those prescribing
those

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and faxing and prescriptions
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
um the only times we really write a
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
written prescription
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
um in our practice at least is for those
 
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.210 align:start position:0%
um in our practice at least is for those
scheduled

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
um controlled substances that require
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
um by DEA rules to have a written
 
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.609 align:start position:0%
um by DEA rules to have a written
prescription

00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
um but to your question about
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
what the other states that don't accept
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
veterinarians I'm not sure what they do
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for that
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions again doctor
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
the chair now calls Gina balkus who
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
and if you could wave your hand from my
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman can you hear me
 
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
again thank you
 
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman of members of
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Gina balkus and I'm
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
the CEO of the Granite State home health
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
and hospice Association which Advocates
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Home Care hospice and
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
palliative care providers in New
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the people they serve
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 143 was reviewed by our
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and several
 
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
hospice medical directors in our
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
association and we support House Bill
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
143 as a way to enhance patient safety
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
and reduce the potential for drug
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
diversion however however we would ask
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider some
 
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.990 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider some
clarifications

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
clarifications
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
first we believe House Bill 143 should
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
include an exception for electronic
 
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
prescribing of compounded medications
 
00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:41.099 align:start position:0%
with Controlled Substances this is a
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
significant concern for hospices as
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
compounded medications are used
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
frequently in hospice care and generally
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
cannot be ordered via e-prescribed
 
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.890 align:start position:0%
cannot be ordered via e-prescribed
platforms

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
platforms
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it's really not clear if line 17
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
through 19 of the bill would cover uh
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
that scenario
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
and while lines 27 through 30 would
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
still allow pharmacists to dispense
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
medications that are otherwise badly
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
validly written oral or faxed
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
a specific exception for compounded
 
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
medications would provide more clarity
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
secondly we want to be sure that this
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
bill does not impact the timely
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
prescribing of controlled medications
 
00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
for dying patients
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
it's not unusual for a hospice nurse
 
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
who's visiting a patient at home to
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
contact the hospice medical director
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
after hours when the physician might not
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
have access to their e-prescribed
 
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.490 align:start position:0%
have access to their e-prescribed
platform

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
platform
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
and this happens when a hospice has a
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
new patient admitted who's actively
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
dying or when a patient runs out of
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
medication unexpectedly due to a dosage
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
change or when there's a delay in
 
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
delivery from a mail order pharmacy
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest amending lines 11 to
 
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
and 12 to include the words or other
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances when the prescriber cannot
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
access electronic prescribing
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
another option would be to specifically
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
exempt hospice prescribers from uh the
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
statute that would be another option
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
so I I also just wanted to share that
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
the hospice medical directors who
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
reviewed House Bill 143 were surprised
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
by the sections in the bill that deal
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
with clinical decision support alerts in
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
e-prescribing programs none of them were
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
aware of any alerts that were designed
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
to increase prescriptions for controlled
 
00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:41.329 align:start position:0%
to increase prescriptions for controlled
medications

00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
medications
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
their experience was that e-prescribing
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
has no impact on doses or amounts of
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
medications prescribed in one physician
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
stated that the alerts generally Tamp
 
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
down prescription patterns rather than
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
seek to increase it
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
um you know I did hear representative
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
Merchant talk about the situation with
 
00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
all scripts in Vermont
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
um the experience that our hospice
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
providers they are not experiencing that
 
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
type of situation
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh so I just wanted to share that with
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
the committee lastly I would recommend a
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
committee check the citation on lines 25
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
to 26.
 
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:26.579 align:start position:0%
I looked up this RSA RSA 318 B2 Romans 6
 
00:48:26.579 --> 00:48:28.010 align:start position:0%
I looked up this RSA RSA 318 B2 Romans 6
a

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.329 align:start position:0%
a
and

00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:29.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:30.410 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.390 align:start position:0%
um
there

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:35.900 align:start position:0%
is not one it just goes to Romans six
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if the proper references
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
318 B1 not B2
 
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
um so I just urge the committee to to
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
check that
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't clear to me what that um it
 
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
says in circumstances where electronic
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to work with the sponsor
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
and the committee on the language to
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
address our concerns you know most
 
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
importantly for us is the compounding
 
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
issue and the issue of access to the
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
platform uh after hours uh to an
 
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
e-prescribing platform after ours so um
 
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
those are my comments and I'm happy to
 
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
answer questions and thank you for the
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
there's a little button you can push to
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative Canucks
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
it waves at me
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
you see it may I
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
well yeah but it's more a clarification
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
for the person testifying because I've
 
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
been caught the same way I think that
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
and and because I thought representative
 
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
Merchant might be to this but that's
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
because 6A doesn't exist yet in statute
 
00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
it was it gets created on page two lines
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
two to six though again I don't
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
understand the referencing but that's
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
where that appears to come in place I
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that as best I can
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
for everybody if I have it correct it's
 
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
just not in statute yet it would be
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
created by this Bill thank you ah thank
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:30.109 align:start position:0%
 
wow

00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else with or without yellow hand
 
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:36.710 align:start position:0%
anyone else with or without yellow hand
up

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you for putting
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
your own hand and the yellow hand up
 
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:45.349 align:start position:0%
your own hand and the yellow hand up
both

00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
now all you need to do is unmute and
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
you've got the trifecta thank you
 
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
um so I'm all your points seem very
 
00:50:59.809 --> 00:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
valid so I'm just hoping that the method
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
to add the write and add the Amendments
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
can be done
 
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.910 align:start position:0%
can be done
efficiently

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
representative gay um
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
in response to your comment like I said
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to work with representative
 
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
Merchant or members of the committee to
 
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:25.430 align:start position:0%
Merchant or members of the committee to
um

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
to discuss language
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
um that uh that might be uh that might
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
and I will reach out to representative
 
00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:39.140 align:start position:0%
Merchant directly after this uh hearing
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
well he's got another hearing and then
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
one after that but but I know what you
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
Miss bocus and now the chair recognizes
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk representative of many years
 
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman can you hear me
 
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
I can
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh good morning to you sir and to
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm Neil Kirk I live in Ware and I'm
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
testifying as a member of the public
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
you back again
 
00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
I opposed
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
um the this bill with respect to its
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
limitations on a patient's right to have
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
a paper prescription to a certain extent
 
00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:35.780 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of the paper prescription
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
in uh the pdmp and a whole variety of
 
00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:41.099 align:start position:0%
other legislation
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
is to is twofold first to allow the
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
patient to shop around for the best
 
00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
patient to shop around for the best
price

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
when you have a paper prescription you
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
can take it to a pharmacy and find out
 
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
what they charge if you don't have a
 
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
paper prescription generally the
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
pharmacy will not give you the answer
 
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
because the the estimate because they
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
don't have enough information to do so
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
even if you have the exact information
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
to give them orally
 
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.309 align:start position:0%
to give them orally
also

00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
um there are many people who buy their
 
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
prescriptions online and
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
um having a paper prescription allows
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
them to search out the best price there
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the United States or
 
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.069 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the United States or
abroad

00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
abroad
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh the second reason for the paper
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
prescription has to do with privacy
 
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
um if you have a paper prescription it's
 
00:53:29.809 --> 00:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
not in the prescription drug database
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
frankly I wonder whether it's in the
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
state's business to know where a person
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
buys his drugs whether it's the local
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacy or Walmart out of state or
 
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.349 align:start position:0%
pharmacy or Walmart out of state or
online

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
and is it really the state's business to
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
know what kind of medication I'm buying
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
um an ED drug an HIV drug a cancer drug
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
all of these are controlled substances
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
and they're all covered by the pdmp
 
00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:56.300 align:start position:0%
through electronic prescription
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
I'd remind folks that over 80 percent of
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
the voters supported the recent
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional informational privacy
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I really wonder whether
 
00:54:06.599 --> 00:54:07.250 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I really wonder whether
um

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
this bill and indeed existing law is
 
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
consistent with that amendment I hope
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
the committee will consider that issue
 
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
um here are the specific problems with
 
00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 143
 
00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
first and I apologize Mr chairman I
 
00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:26.339 align:start position:0%
can't cite page and line numbers because
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
my copy of the bill does not have them
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
but uh Roman 1 Pharmacists and
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacies probably lined three or four
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the bill or when the bills the text
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the amend Bill starts
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
um has an exception for paper
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
prescriptions with respect to controlled
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
drugs in other words
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
you can get a paper prescription except
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
for controlled drugs is defined in RSA
 
00:54:53.819 --> 00:54:55.630 align:start position:0%
for controlled drugs is defined in RSA
18b

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
18b
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
1 Roman six
 
00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.569 align:start position:0%
1 Roman six
now

00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand that but I
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
think that refers to opioids and opioid
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh copies
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
if that's what it does I think that's
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
not bad that's reasonable we have an
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis and there is a legitimate
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
interest in the state to get that
 
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.430 align:start position:0%
interest in the state to get that
information

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
but if it covers something beyond that
 
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
then I would ask you to consider
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
limiting it to the opioid type
 
00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:26.150 align:start position:0%
limiting it to the opioid type
prescriptions

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.930 align:start position:0%
um
secondly

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 3 a
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
couple of lines down probably on the
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
first page two
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
it says notwithstanding any provision of
 
00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:42.059 align:start position:0%
law to the contrary which means
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
it ignores and overrides what we just
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
discussed on
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
um about a paper prescription
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
no person shall issue a prescription for
 
00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
a controlled drug unless it's made by
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
electronic prescription
 
00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:59.450 align:start position:0%
electronic prescription
Etc

00:55:59.450 --> 00:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
in this case controlled drug is not
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
defined not limited in the same way it
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
is in the 1B
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
and so I wonder if there's not a
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
conflict here
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
again if the words control drug in 3A
 
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
had the same limitation as defined in
 
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.150 align:start position:0%
had the same limitation as defined in
RSA

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
318b16 then I think we would be avoiding
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
a conflict and still allowing paper
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for all controlled drugs
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
except opioids
 
00:56:33.839 --> 00:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
except opioids
um

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
I think regardless of what the
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
committee's decision is on the issues
 
00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.099 align:start position:0%
that I'm raising I think it's very
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
important to deal with the consistency
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
issue I don't think in the same statute
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
we should use controlled drugs in
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
different manners unless that's
 
00:56:48.359 --> 00:56:49.730 align:start position:0%
different manners unless that's
intentional

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
but the idea that in the same uh that
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
that the legislature giveth in section
 
00:56:57.970 --> 00:56:57.980 align:start position:0%
one and taketh away in section two
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
strikes me as somewhat strange I don't
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
think that was intentional but I think
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's what's Happening Here
 
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.870 align:start position:0%
that's what's Happening Here
um

00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
that completes my testimony Mr chairman
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'd be pleased to answer any questions
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
anyone with a question for
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you representative for
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
this exhausts my list as printed out at
 
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
about quarter of nine has anyone else
 
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
signed up that
 
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
um representative Acton can see on his
 
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.450 align:start position:0%
um representative Acton can see on his
screen

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's it
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's it yeah
 
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
well then before we end the hearing
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
um what is your pleasure representative
 
00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:58.670 align:start position:0%
um what is your pleasure representative
Merchant

00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
would you like us to move to exec this
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
right now or would you like to give it a
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
week and wait for the veterinarian board
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
to speak and perhaps you to speak with
 
00:58:17.569 --> 00:58:17.579 align:start position:0%
um uh doctor whoever it was uh no uh
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
Gina balkus or others and come back with
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment if you wish and we can
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
execute next week what is your pleasure
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to work on an amendment I
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
need to address a couple of issues I
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
think are raised by this committee by
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
some of the people testifying before the
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
committee I'm looking at with the
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
doctors representative Woods about the
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
clarification on which board provides
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
the waiver I think it needs to be
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
addressed I think also I need to look at
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
the federal law and how it deals with
 
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
compounded medications if they do or do
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
not because in hospice a lot of is paid
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
for by the Medicare program so therefore
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
even though we may exempt it for
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
compounded medications if the Federal
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
Law requires it then we can't exempt the
 
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
federal law so I need to work with uh
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
Mrs falcus about that to get that
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
clarified and also wait for the
 
00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
veterinarian board if the amendment is
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
approved by them so if it's okay with
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
the chair I'd like to hold this not
 
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
exact on it and work on an amendment to
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
work with the parties to make the
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
amendment work for everyone as much as
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
we possible that's our way here is to
 
00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:27.299 align:start position:0%
make good things better so yes come back
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to execute next week we have
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
until March 11 to get everything done so
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
we're going to be moving a little more
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
quickly but thank you so much and with
 
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
that I uh recognize representative Marsh
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
who just beat my gavel to the wooden
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
desk thank you everyone I just want to
 
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
be compliant with 91a and tell everyone
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
that I am here present and I'm at home
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
alone in Brookfield and there's nobody
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the room with me
 
00:59:58.970 --> 00:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
with that we closed the hearing on House
 
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 143
 
01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:04.700 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
now open the hearing
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 572
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
relative to pharmacist administration of
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
vaccines and allowing a licensed
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
Advanced pharmacy technician to
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
administer vaccines and before I ask
 
01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:26.299 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant to
 
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:30.059 align:start position:0%
bring forth his presentation on his bill
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask my vice chair if he
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
would to
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
um text me and as we've been doing
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
the people who are signed up to testify
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
because I don't have that information
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
we're breaking in a new printer and it's
 
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
doing everything except printing so if
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
you would do just one thing that's all
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
all the lights and bells are great thank
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
you for that and representative Merchant
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
please present your bill
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm still representative Merchant
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
from Claremont New Hampshire Sullivan
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
County District 4 and also I wanted to
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
recognize the committee and also the
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
public it may be listening in
 
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
today I bring to you is House Bill 572
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
and what we're trying to do with House
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
Bill 572 is two fundamental things one
 
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
is to align the vaccines that can be
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
given by a pharmacist and a pharmacy to
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
what the CDC guidelines
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
um have provided they're uh approved by
 
01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
the FDA which is something we need to
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
add an amendment
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
the reason for it being is that as we
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
look at vaccinations we recognize as a
 
01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:47.420 align:start position:0%
society that vaccines are cost effective
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
they're helpful in trying to prevent a
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
lot of disease and the cost of the
 
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
disease not just financially but the
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
cost of the patient for getting the
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
vaccine to prevent it in the first place
 
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
today 34 of proximated vaccines given in
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire are given by
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
a pharmacist in a pharmacy which is a
 
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
tremendous stride in the direction of
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
trying to increase access to vaccines so
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
patients can get a vaccine at their
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
convenience in a location that's close
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
to their home
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
um but the challenge we're running into
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the pharmacy world
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
is also the question about
 
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
having Personnel that's been shown in
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
the in the covet situation enough
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
Personnel in the pharmacy to get the
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
vaccines and to do in such a way that it
 
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
can be done safely
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
they've been done cost effectively and
 
01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:37.940 align:start position:0%
done in a timely manner
 
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
most of the reasons why patients go to a
 
01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:42.299 align:start position:0%
pharmacy in the first place is because
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
of convenience they do it on their time
 
01:02:47.569 --> 01:02:47.579 align:start position:0%
off we don't delay them they come in at
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
that point in time they have ready
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
access to it it doesn't require an
 
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.190 align:start position:0%
access to it it doesn't require an
appointment

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
um vaccines have been shown to be
 
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
extremely safe
 
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
and effective and so forth so therefore
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
we're trying to just expand the vaccines
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
but not so much to expand it but to
 
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
align it with the CDC
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
guidelines for immunizations for adults
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
so if the CDC determines that another
 
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
vaccine should be given in the adult
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
profile we don't have to go back to the
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
state law to add it to the list it
 
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
automatically becomes part of it
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
the other part is on the licensed
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
technician we've seen also with covid
 
01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
that personnel and having people trained
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
to give a vaccine comparable to what we
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
do in a medical office The Physician per
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
se does not give the vaccine but they're
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
the ones that have to be approving the
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
vaccine they did the ones that screen
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
the patient for it
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
Etc so just as a physician's office you
 
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
have a medical assistant that actually
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
administer the vaccines they can't
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
approve it but they can administer the
 
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
vaccine and I also work with
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative Woods initially we talked
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
about supervision and instead of having
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
just general supervision we had to be
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
sure that the pharmacist is on site and
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
the reason for that being is that if
 
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
something goes wrong they're the ones
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
trained to address the issue
 
01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:02.339 align:start position:0%
um it's one of the things to give the
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine but if something heaven forbid
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
happens the person on site the
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
professional is the pharmacist to deal
 
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
with that situation
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
and fundamentally what we're trying to
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
do is make this as easy as possible for
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
patients to get vaccines
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
um and trying to minimize the barriers
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
either financially or time for them to
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
obtain it what's nice about today with
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act most vaccines
 
01:04:29.329 --> 01:04:29.339 align:start position:0%
are paid for there's no co-pays no
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
deductibles so the financial burden has
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
been lifted on most of the patients the
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
challenge now is getting the convenience
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that people can actually get to the
 
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
vaccines in their own time and their own
 
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.530 align:start position:0%
vaccines in their own time and their own
schedule

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this is to expand the
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
ability to give as many vaccines as we
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
possibly can in society in a location
 
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's very convenient at the same time
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
not delay the patient from getting the
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
therapy they need one of the things that
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
we talked about before when we had to
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
have a prescription for a patient the
 
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
have a prescription for a patient the
delay

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
delay
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
for the patient can be
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes a day or two trying to reach a
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
provider today in an office is very
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
difficult very challenging we see that
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
happening a lot of times with prior
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
approvals patients can weigh up to two
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
or three days for a medication before
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance company will pay for it so
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
we're trying to again minimize that
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
inconvenience that is created by going
 
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
through a another safety check if you
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
will when probably it's not required at
 
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.109 align:start position:0%
will when probably it's not required at
all

01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
so looking at it that way this again
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
goes back to my original comment we need
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
to find a way to align the CDC
 
01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.230 align:start position:0%
to find a way to align the CDC
guidelines

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
for adult immunizations and number two
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
we need to try to make it as convenient
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
as possible for the patient and allow
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
for personnel to administer the vaccine
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
in a way that helps the patient obtain
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
it Timely
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
easily and conveniently and this is
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
really what the goal of the whole bill
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
is to allow for licensed technicians we
 
01:06:00.049 --> 01:06:00.059 align:start position:0%
two years ago approved for them to be
 
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
licensed they're not somebody that's a
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
they go through two thousand hours with
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
the training courses and so forth so
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's Personnel that are highly trained
 
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
as technicians to uh to do work and
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're just adding another task or
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
function to that functionality in Esco
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
for practice
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions
 
01:06:19.619 --> 01:06:24.770 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions
questions

01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
I have one I think I know again I think
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
I know the answer to it but I'd like to
 
01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
hear it from you if one of my medical
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
assistants gives an injection to a
 
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.370 align:start position:0%
assistants gives an injection to a
patient

01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:36.380 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
and something goes seriously wrong there
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
is a physician or occasionally just a
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner on site that can step
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
in with whatever went wrong would you
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
consider a pharmacist to be the
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
it they're trained to deal with those
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
situations as part of the training they
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
go through it's a 20 20 hour program on
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
top of what they do through school
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
itself so yes it's not so much their
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
equivalent in their training and what
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
they're doing diagnostically but they're
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
trained to deal with the issue that may
 
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.390 align:start position:0%
trained to deal with the issue that may
arise

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
arise
 
01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
um how to use an EpiPen how to help the
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
patient out
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
um so yes in that capacity they're equal
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to confuse people in
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
thinking that a pharmacist is training
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
like a physician because they're not but
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
they are trying to deal with the
 
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
situation that may arise within the
 
01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.190 align:start position:0%
situation that may arise within the
pharmacy

01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.150 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
Ashwin

01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:39.740 align:start position:0%
um representative I'm just wondering
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
does the on-site I see that you you said
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
that sorry you said that
 
01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
um having the on-site
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
um word added to the bill creates more
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
oversight but I you strike out the word
 
01:07:58.079 --> 01:07:59.589 align:start position:0%
oversight but I you strike out the word
Direct

01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
Direct
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
so can you just speak to that a little
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
bit because I'm a little confused the
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
word direct is the same with a
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
inside of a physician's office the
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
medical assistant doesn't have direct
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
supervision by the provider the provider
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
could be in the area so the medical
 
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
assistance is giving the vaccine if you
 
01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
will in a room but the provider may not
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
be in the room to provide direct but
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
they are on site so that was one of the
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
concerns we had before is to ensure that
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
in fact the LPN I mean the lapt
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
cannot work independent if you will from
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist they have to be there
 
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
physically to deal with the issues that
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and follow-up follow-up
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
um does the notification piece
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
um that you hadn't struck out
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
um does that require
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
the PCP to be notified and respond
 
01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
um respond to that notification prior to
 
01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
the administration of the vaccine
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
no it's the
 
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
allow for the PCP a lot of times just to
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
be clear about this in the world of
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy Many Many I mean many patients
 
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a PCB there are a lot of
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
patients out there that don't have a
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
primary care doc
 
01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.289 align:start position:0%
primary care doc
um

01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
so therefore that's one of the issues
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
run into but the goal here was to get
 
01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:30.299 align:start position:0%
the information back into the medical
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
record of the primary care doctor the
 
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
doc or the provider overseeing them so
 
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
what we basically at that point in time
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
want to be sure we have as much as
 
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
possible a comprehensive record with the
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
provider so if a pharmacist does get the
 
01:09:47.209 --> 01:09:47.219 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's given by them that that is
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
reported back to the primary care
 
01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
physician so it could be part of the
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
can I have one more follow-up oh one
 
01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:57.950 align:start position:0%
can I have one more follow-up oh one
more

01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.270 align:start position:0%
more
um

01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
I I just I see that that line is struck
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
in your bill for the covid-19 vaccine so
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
they it doesn't require notification
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
that was the reason that's why it was
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
there first I'm sorry about that
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman what we now have
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
as a registry and I'll speak that as
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
well the communication back to the
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
provider if we have the registry in
 
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
place the provider can have access to
 
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
the medication or to the vaccine and the
 
01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
information there well we did do within
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
the law if you look at the line as
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
required by state law so if the law does
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
not require the pharmacist to put it in
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
the registry if the patient wants to opt
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
out or opt-in that's another discussion
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
it depends upon what the law requires
 
01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist will then have to comply
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
with what the law is
 
01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:50.219 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to look for a
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
communication tool between the
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and the provider before the
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
register we had no other way to do that
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
we only could do it verbally or through
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
a fax to get it back to the provider
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
because there's no other communication
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
tool by using the registry there is a
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
communication tool between the provider
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the pharmacist
 
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
however if the patient opts out then
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's up to the patient to notify the
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
provider that they want it in their
 
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.470 align:start position:0%
provider that they want it in their
record

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative soloway you had your own
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh and thank
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
question so this the data on
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
immunization does get into the registry
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
what about unanticipated uh Adverse
 
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.689 align:start position:0%
what about unanticipated uh Adverse
Events

01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
um if they had an event I would expect
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist is not required to make a
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
communication back to the primary care
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
physician if they have one to notify
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
them of a situation that may have
 
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.510 align:start position:0%
them of a situation that may have
occurred

01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
um it's back to the healthcare team in
 
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
which the pharmacist is a part of is
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
somehow getting it back to the provider
 
01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:00.020 align:start position:0%
if it was and actually a adverse effect
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
the bill does not address it represent a
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
solid it doesn't require the pharmacist
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
to give it back but it they wanted to
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
add that in there if the person had an
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
adverse event I mean we could do that
 
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
but I'm not it's not there
 
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
representative Woods
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I just I would
 
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
like to offer a little bit of perhaps
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
further clarification about striking the
 
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
direct that was something we had a
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
discussion about and uh direct means uh
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh in the past has been by telephone so
 
01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:38.060 align:start position:0%
that a pharmacist potentially uh could
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
be the mentor directly to being absurd
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
50 pharmacies
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
um and have no direct contact
 
01:12:50.169 --> 01:12:50.179 align:start position:0%
when I chaired the state workers comp
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
commission uh we discovered that case
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
workers were doing it directly but they
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
again telephonically and somewhere in
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
California being case managers
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
um so my my goal was to sort of avoid
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
the individuals uh monitoring uh just by
 
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
telephone many sites which is not what
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
we wanted and changed it to on-site so
 
01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:18.380 align:start position:0%
that there would be direct
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman that was one of the
 
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
things that was discussed too is we
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have direct done remotely
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh with a camera so it does provide
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
direct sight because you can visually
 
01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
see somebody but you're not physically
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
on site which is what representative
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
wood was concerned about as well as
 
01:13:39.239 --> 01:13:40.750 align:start position:0%
wood was concerned about as well as
myself

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.610 align:start position:0%
myself
foreign

01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:42.620 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.130 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
um I may not have understood exactly
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
what uh y'all are talking about but the
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events the veres I don't know
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
what the status of theirs in New
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is but certainly if we're
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
going to be doing recording uh optional
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
or not whatever is legal uh if we're
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
gonna do recording of immunizations I've
 
01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
I think the any kind of adverse
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
reactions needs to be in there but it
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like there's any field in
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
this uh system that allows for that much
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
less requires it
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not an immunizing pharmacist I have
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at that
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative gay my understanding is
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
that if you do have a reaction to a
 
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:42.770 align:start position:0%
that if you do have a reaction to a
vaccine

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
from the peers I've talked to there is a
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
requirement to notify the um there's a
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
form to fill out to
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
um complete that notify within registry
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
not somewhere to the state but the
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
federal registry with what's going on
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
with the vaccine but it's not a
 
01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.550 align:start position:0%
with the vaccine but it's not a
requirement

01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
um built into the law I'd have to go
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
back and look at that and find out if
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's actually required as part of given
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
the vaccine That vaccine
 
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
reactions are somehow recorded in some
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative gay yes well the
 
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
system that you're talking about
 
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
recording uh are you just talking about
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
the system that we're considering
 
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
whether to make it
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
happen or not
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're counting on using
 
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
some kind of system so that the PCP can
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
be notified without you having to send a
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
fax no
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
um since the level said we don't require
 
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.770 align:start position:0%
um since the level said we don't require
today

01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:49.970 align:start position:0%
today
um so

01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to be clear that we've
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
been given vaccines in the pharmacy
 
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
Community for quite a long time and 34
 
01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
of them were given the Community
 
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy so whatever is being done today
 
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to change we're trying
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
to basically leave it alone it doesn't
 
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
it seems to be working the communication
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
back to the provider is the critical
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
part to it
 
01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
um I do know if you have an adverse drug
 
01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
reaction that there is a requirement to
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
report that to the FDA so the FDA can
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
monitor certain things but to your point
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go back per se to the
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah it doesn't go into
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
registry either Registries only to
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
record the actual vaccination not
 
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
recording adverse effects that they may
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
occur within the vaccination that's not
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
part of the registry
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I have two more on my
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
a yes thank you Mr chair and I I wanted
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
to discuss a little bit more the vaccine
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
registry and the requirement to notify
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
practitioners about vaccinations
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
um given that the the vaccine registry
 
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
whether we make it opt-in or opt out we
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
have another bill about that uh the
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
people there will still be some people
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
who are going to opt out of it whichever
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
way it goes uh given that that system is
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
not yet functional don't you think it
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea to continue to
 
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
require that pcps when they're known be
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
notified about vaccinations that are
 
01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.570 align:start position:0%
notified about vaccinations that are
given

01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
I think until the registry is up and
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
fully functional that could be a logical
 
01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
thing to do I think we want to be sure
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
that the PCP
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
um is aware of what's going on the
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines what we're trying to avoid in
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
that is two things I believe one is
 
01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:40.739 align:start position:0%
notifications of the BCP so they're
 
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
aware of it but number two is not to
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
have both providers giving a vaccine
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
when they don't require the patient to
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
do that I've been in my situation before
 
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
in a in a hospital where we had a
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
patient get a pneumococcal vaccine a
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
long-term care facility because of their
 
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
requirements with CMS they go to the
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
hospital for a cute situation they got
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
another pneumococcal vaccine they get
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
discharged to a third facility
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
and they get another pneumococcal
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
vaccine so I think communication is key
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
to it representative Marsh and until
 
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
that registry is up and running I would
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
say yes it makes logical sense to
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
maintain some sort of
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
communication tool back to the primary
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
care provider until the registry is
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
fully functional
 
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
and I'd be not opposed to it and not uh
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
not least but at this moment last
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I'm really sorry for
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
some reason my little yellow hand is not
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
yellow and it turns out to be exactly
 
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
the same color as the paint in the room
 
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
that I'm sitting I like the hand you
 
01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:47.030 align:start position:0%
that I'm sitting I like the hand you
raised

01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
um but I I have made other arrangements
 
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.770 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
um I am hearing Mrs Casey my fourth and
 
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
sixth grade third and fifth grade
 
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.490 align:start position:0%
sixth grade third and fifth grade
teachers

01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
um voice in my ear as I read this and uh
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
if you look on line six and seven of the
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
bill is drafted
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
um it says May
 
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
May administer vaccines is approved by
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
an immunizing pharmacist and which have
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
been approved by the sender for Disease
 
01:19:26.689 --> 01:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
Control but I think the words which have
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
been approved by the Centers for Disease
 
01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.890 align:start position:0%
been approved by the Centers for Disease
Control

01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
Control
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
ought to follow the word vaccine
 
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
and then there ought to be a comma and
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
as approved by an immunizing pharmacist
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
because uh those words relate to the
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
vaccine they do not relate to the
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and I would just suggest if
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
there is a um yes if there is a
 
01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
an amendment that that might be put in
 
01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a thought
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
absolute Weber thank you for that um I
 
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
totally agree with what you're saying I
 
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
also in the amendment inserted the fact
 
01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
that which is not coming the one before
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
he doesn't include it but the one that's
 
01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:11.699 align:start position:0%
coming is going to use this on boards in
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
the same language that you're
 
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
referencing but it did include the
 
01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
language that the vaccine also had to be
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA not just by the CDC
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
so that's going to be included in the
 
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
amendment but I will definitely go back
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
and work on the language and if you be
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
so kind for me to send it to you to
 
01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:30.659 align:start position:0%
review it before I submit it I would
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
my editor of my second and third book
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
would like to meet your third and fifth
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
grade teacher representative Weber I
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
didn't know that until I started writing
 
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
as an adult and you were well educated
 
01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.490 --> 01:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
yeah Leah unmute
 
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.010 align:start position:0%
yeah Leah unmute
yeah

01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:00.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Merchant I
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
am wondering does this bill so if we are
 
01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:12.659 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad that you said that you
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
would you have an amendment coming
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
forward to include FDA approval
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
um this opens it up to pharmacists being
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
able to give a lot more vaccines than
 
01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
they are currently able to give under
 
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.350 align:start position:0%
they are currently able to give under
statute

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
um there are I counted last night 89 FDA
 
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
approved vaccines many
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
um are competing
 
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.030 align:start position:0%
um are competing
um

01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
with competing manufacturers for the
 
01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:44.219 align:start position:0%
same disease and
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
um I just see this changing the dynamic
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
on how pharmacists decide to recommend
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines and I see an opportunity for
 
01:21:59.280 --> 01:21:59.990 align:start position:0%
vaccines and I see an opportunity for
um

01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
you know we see some whining and dining
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
of Physicians to prescribe certain
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
medications by pharmaceutical reps and
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know even when those are not the
 
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
first line treatment or you know the
 
01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
best option for a patient as evidence by
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
the literature
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
The Physician is has chosen those based
 
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
on their incentives given to them by a
 
01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical representative
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:31.850 align:start position:0%
so my question is
um

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
should we really be opening this up for
 
01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
a pharmacist to
 
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
um you know it could become a an
 
01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sell as many vaccines as
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
possible for any disease Under the Sun
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
including ones that are not typically
 
01:22:47.159 --> 01:22:49.130 align:start position:0%
including ones that are not typically
recommended

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
um like the BCG the live BCG which is
 
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
the tuberculosis vaccine and um the
 
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
anthrax vaccine those have high rates of
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
and I I'm I'm not sure do Farms if
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
pharmacists take a oath to do no harm
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
but I just see some problems opening
 
01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
that up would you be okay with
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
um an amendment to keep it limited to
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
the current vaccines that are
 
01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:17.540 align:start position:0%
administered by pharmacists influenza
 
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
hepatitis A Hepatitis B Tdap MMR
 
01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.850 align:start position:0%
hepatitis A Hepatitis B Tdap MMR
meningococcal

01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
meningococcal
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
and covid-19 pneumococcal
 
01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:35.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
I want to say thank you for the question
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
um what the amendment does because I did
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
make an error and I when drafting it and
 
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
it included all vaccines and it was
 
01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
never the intent so the amendment
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
clarifies that to only the vaccines that
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
are on the CDC schedule for adult
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
vaccinations which includes 10 vaccines
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
um So within those 10 vaccines basically
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
eight of them today a pharmacist can
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
give or adding the other two to a line
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
of completely with the CDC guidelines
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
um as far as looking at the vaccines and
 
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
which ones most pharmacists today work
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
in Corporate America so the decision
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
upon which vaccine is being purchased if
 
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
you will is not done locally by the
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist done by Corporate America
 
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.430 align:start position:0%
pharmacist done by Corporate America
so

01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
that's kind of I hear the concern but I
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
would say the concern for the most part
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't really exist at the pharmacist
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
level because they're not the ones
 
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
deciding upon which vaccine which brand
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
of a vaccine to utilize is done by their
 
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh the corporate America that they work
 
01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.950 align:start position:0%
uh the corporate America that they work
for

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.729 --> 01:24:42.739 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for taking my question
 
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't know it before
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
um VI record the vaccination in the
 
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
state vaccine registry
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
since that is going to be an option if
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
people so choose the rest of VI says uh
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
to me the whole thing maintain a record
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
of administration of vaccinations for
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
each individual as required by state and
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
would that be acceptable to you to
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
remove that record the vaccination the
 
01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
state vaccine registry and just use the
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
rest of the sentence
 
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
represent gay can you say that again
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
which which line do you want ma'am VI
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah the first words are record the
 
01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
vaccination in the state vaccine
 
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
registry and find 26.
 
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
yes sorry line 26. because that's a
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
choice of the person who's receiving the
 
01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.130 align:start position:0%
choice of the person who's receiving the
vaccine

01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
and right now it doesn't even exist
 
01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
but the rest of the sentence says it it
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
says you maintain a record
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
as required by state and federal law so
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
to me that would cover it without
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not mandatory it's okay I'm not
 
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
a post taking out the word record the
 
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
vaccination in the state registry
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the sentence it
 
01:26:09.169 --> 01:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
does say as required by state and
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
federal law so if the state and federal
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
law do not require it then Essence that
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
takes precedent over the earlier part so
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
but to pull it out completely I have no
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
um it helps to clarify it so that the
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
person only puts it in there if it's
 
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
an opt-in opt-out situation which is a
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
different Bill I just want to be sure
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
that we don't have language in one bill
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
that conflicts with language and another
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm trying to write in such a
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
way that
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
when you look at the state law whatever
 
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
the state law is is what you have to
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
comply with so if it's an opt-in they do
 
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative gay do you want to follow
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
up yes so
 
01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:58.370 align:start position:0%
up yes so
um

01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
this is that acceptable to you to take
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
that out to take the record the
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination the state vaccine registry
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
remove it it would make me a lot happier
 
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
because that comes across as we're going
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
to do it and you've got to really
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
you've got to make quite an effort to
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
make sure it doesn't get recorded if
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's so what you so choose
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not opposed to taking it out but I
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
do concern myself is that down the road
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
the Law changes something else I just
 
01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that whatever the law is
 
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
there which we can leave in there is
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
what we comply with so if you want to
 
01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:35.219 align:start position:0%
take it out the beginning of it say
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
maintain a record
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
um the question is what's the record
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
because there's no reference to what
 
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
that record is if we don't have a
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
registry when you talk about maintain a
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
record for an Administration where is
 
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
that record going
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
um but back to the same thing with
 
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative marks and we could go
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
back to the paper system and say you
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
have to submit it to a provider
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
um a PCB whether you have one or not
 
01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's been
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for us in the past because
 
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
many times as pharmacists we provide
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
information back to the provider's
 
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
office but it doesn't get into the chart
 
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
because the staff at the office doesn't
 
01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
always put it in the chart so I'm trying
 
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
to be sure whatever vehicle we have for
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
communication is going to be workable
 
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
timely so that all the parties are aware
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
of what's going on in the vaccine world
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern is that if we
 
01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:25.139 align:start position:0%
don't put something in there about the
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
registry then
 
01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
what are you gonna what are we going to
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
what's the record I'm not opposed to it
 
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just not sure what the alternative
 
01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.810 align:start position:0%
I'm just not sure what the alternative
is

01:28:37.810 --> 01:28:37.820 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Weber you
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
and your mic that was using that was
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
user malfunction I'm sorry
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
test them all out we got to do that
 
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.810 align:start position:0%
test them all out we got to do that
periodically

01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
periodically
 
01:28:58.850 --> 01:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Merchant um
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
I am just wondering what are those eight
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
vaccines that you were saying so in
 
01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
addition to the ones that are in statute
 
01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:12.470 align:start position:0%
addition to the ones that are in statute
currently

01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
um can you can you send me those those
 
01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:16.129 align:start position:0%
um can you can you send me those those
eight

01:29:16.129 --> 01:29:16.139 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
and tell me which well I mean I can
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
figure out which ones are not last night
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
I sent out to the committee if you look
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
on the CDC guidelines on the links to it
 
01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the vaccines that are
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
on the CDC
 
01:29:31.729 --> 01:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
I can pull it up to the screen but
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
there's one two three four
 
01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
all right eight nine
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
ten there's ten of them that we
 
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
currently are allowed to to administer
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
and there's two additional ones and the
 
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
two are
 
01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
um HPV
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and the other one's Thermopolis
 
01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
those are the only two I only two
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are on the CDC adult
 
01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
immunization schedule
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
that are not currently Allowed by law
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
for the pharmacist who administer
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow-up follow up
 
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
um so the HPV vaccine that's one that's
 
01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
also got a high rate of adverse
 
01:30:11.699 --> 01:30:13.310 align:start position:0%
also got a high rate of adverse
reactions

01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
reactions
 
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
um and I think that these are in statute
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
specifically named for a reason we don't
 
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
want to give you know broad open this up
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
broadly to anything that the CDC decides
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
is is added and I think we want to keep
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
the control within the state on on what
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
we can have our our pharmacists give
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
um so would you be okay with an
 
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:36.530 align:start position:0%
um so would you be okay with an
amendment

01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
um uh if I if I would you look at an
 
01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
amendment to just keep it with what we
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
have in statute currently
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
I would look at an amendment but I think
 
01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
again the same thing what we're running
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
into now with cobit which is showing us
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
whenever there's another vaccine that
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
the CDC wants to be able to be provided
 
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
by a pharmacist in a pharmacy Community
 
01:30:59.810 --> 01:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
then we have to go back to the stature
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
through emergency order to add it and my
 
01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
concern is that by doing it that way the
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
ability for us as a state to react to
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
something in a relatively
 
01:31:12.169 --> 01:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
timely manner is diminished
 
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes uh me who
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
has his hand up
 
01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.770 align:start position:0%
has his hand up
um

01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:22.209 --> 01:31:22.219 align:start position:0%
part-time CEO of a
 
01:31:25.129 --> 01:31:25.139 align:start position:0%
massage and Counseling and Family
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
Practice Facility with three pcps and
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
we have as most primary care offices our
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
patient visits skew very much to the
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
older we don't see the youngins very
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
often we see the old ones quite
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
regularly and they have at least as bad
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
a memory as I do which is not very good
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there are occurrences where
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
they don't remember that their PCP gave
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
them something three months ago and here
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
they are in the pharmacy and it sounds
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
like it'd be a good idea and they're
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
with somebody and said Nana did you get
 
01:32:06.110 --> 01:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
your shot and she says I don't think so
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
and um wouldn't it be advantageous
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
before the pharmacy gives the shots not
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
because they're not capable of it but
 
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
the person before them may have already
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
had one and doesn't need one uh wouldn't
 
01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
that be a good idea is to call the PCP
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman
 
01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
um you spoke very eloquently to why we
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
should opt in not opt out of the
 
01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.770 align:start position:0%
should opt in not opt out of the
registry

01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I couldn't have asked for a better
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
introduction to that
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I think part of it is communication I
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the reasons why
 
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
other states in the country have a
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
registry to avoid that because even
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
myself as a patient I don't always keep
 
01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
track of my vaccines but if it's in the
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
registry as a record and therefore
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
everyone has access to it then at that
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
point in time the provider can go to the
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
registry and say oh Mrs Smith you've
 
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
already had your pneumococcal vaccine
 
01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
you do not need to have it again you had
 
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
it two or three months ago or even a
 
01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
year ago two years ago so to answer your
 
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
question I think it's back to the
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
communication tool that we all use and
 
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
therefore the registry becomes the
 
01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:19.100 align:start position:0%
vehicle that we can all
 
01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:20.649 align:start position:0%
vehicle that we can all
utilize

01:33:20.649 --> 01:33:20.659 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
independent of each other so therefore I
 
01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
yeah that's definitely a situation but
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't forget also I I don't know about
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
you folks but
 
01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
um most people today I know my father
 
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
goes to probably three or four or five
 
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
different doctors so the world of having
 
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
a primary care doc per se he has a
 
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
um pulmonologist he has a cardiologist
 
01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
he has a rheumatologist
 
01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:45.770 align:start position:0%
he has a rheumatologist
um

01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
any sort of jokes about it he says you
 
01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
know go back to the old days when I had
 
01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
Dr Welby MD and I had one physician they
 
01:33:55.729 --> 01:33:55.739 align:start position:0%
made my locker my life a lot easier
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
um you know the communication so I hear
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
yeah he wasn't trying to be eloquent I
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
was just trying to make more work for my
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
staff but uh thank you for connecting
 
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
the dots
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
anybody else with a question from the
 
01:34:12.719 --> 01:34:15.229 align:start position:0%
anybody else with a question from the
committee

01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
in which case thank you and thank you
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
for being our our committee now
 
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate that very much we've got a
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
couple of people that I've been informed
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh wish to speak and uh they wish to
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
testify they um
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
they include care yes sorry
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson has his hand up
 
01:34:40.729 --> 01:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson thank you so much
 
01:34:40.739 --> 01:34:42.250 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson thank you so much
representative

01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:42.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you to both of you
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
um could all the people have all these
 
01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
suggestions for amendments could they
 
01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:52.620 align:start position:0%
please directly send them to the author
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
because I can't keep track of them all
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
the suggestions they have to fix this or
 
01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:02.090 align:start position:0%
the suggestions they have to fix this or
that

01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
spoken as the clerk should speak yes
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
they should go to the primary sponsor
 
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
who coordinates all of that and uh
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
anybody can make an amendment anybody
 
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
can come in with a hostile Amendment but
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
it would be much better I think and who
 
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
we are if everybody with an
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
encouragement a suggestion or even
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
something a bit negative would get two
 
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants so we could
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
have uh one Amendment and if that
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't satisfy an individual we will
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
entertain that individual's Contra
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment as well but thank you
 
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh Laura Condon please
 
01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%

morning Mr chairman
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
um an honorable committee members my
 
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
name is Laura Condon I'm from Bedford
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm a volunteer New Hampshire
 
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
director of advocacy with the national
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine information center and I testify
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
today in opposition of House Bill 572
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
for three particular reasons
 
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
um but before I get to my three reasons
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
I would like to add some information to
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
prior testimony number one the the
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
adverse effect reporting
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
um from adverse effects of vaccination
 
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
is required by federal law that
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
providers of vaccination do submit
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse offense to the vaccine
 
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
adverse event Reporting System there was
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
questioned whether that would be
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
required a pharmacist
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
um my understanding I'd have to double
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
check federal law that it requires
 
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
providers of vaccines and I assume that
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
would include pharmacists so I do
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
believe that is a requirement
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
it'd be great if that was highlighted in
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
the bill there was also mentioned that
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
um it is difficulty for
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
um providers to keep a record of
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines and you know how is a
 
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
pharmacist going to keep that current
 
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
Law requires that doctors provide keep a
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
record of vaccination given to their
 
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
patients I'm not sure if that law
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
required makes the same requirement on
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
pharmacists but it certainly does on
 
01:37:18.719 --> 01:37:20.209 align:start position:0%
pharmacists but it certainly does on
Physicians

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
Physicians
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and it also requires that those
 
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
individuals being vaccinated be given
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
about a record of their vaccination at
 
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
the time of vaccination so those things
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
are currently required under current law
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
by doctors I'm not sure if that extends
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
to pharmacists I'd have to check that
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
so just wanted to mention those my
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
objections to the bill are number one
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
is that influenza vaccines should be
 
01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
limited to adults in this law it allows
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
for intellect vaccines to be given to
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
the general public which of course would
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
include infants as young as six months
 
01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
of age this trivializes the very real
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine risks and serious reactions by
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
giving flu shots to infants and children
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
and the corner drugstore or grocery
 
01:38:09.169 --> 01:38:09.179 align:start position:0%
store pharmacy most pharmacies and
 
01:38:11.209 --> 01:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
grocery stores don't have life-saving
 
01:38:13.729 --> 01:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
defibrillators will pharmacists have the
 
01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
equipment and training to be able to
 
01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
tell the difference between Cardiac
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
Arrest anaphylaxis fainting and act
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
accordingly to save the lives of babies
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
and children who react at the time of
 
01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:24.590 align:start position:0%
and children who react at the time of
vaccination

01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
also this bill undermines the need for a
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
medical home for a child pharmacists
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the necessary medical history
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
of an infant or child or the time to
 
01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
pre-screen for contraindication based on
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
the child's personal and family history
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
and unique Health needs prior to
 
01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.250 align:start position:0%
and unique Health needs prior to
vaccination

01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
children today may get as many as 70
 
01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
doses of vaccines for 16 different
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
diseases many vaccines now come in
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
cocktail shots containing up to five
 
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
different vaccines in one shot it is
 
01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
difficult for parents to remember if the
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
flu shot was one of them this is why
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
they need a medical home to keep a
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
patient history and vaccine schedules
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
including the flu shot when appropriate
 
01:39:01.679 --> 01:39:05.950 align:start position:0%
including the flu shot when appropriate
foreign

01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates have been reported by
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
Beth Daly of DHHS as being up to 70
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
percent for children in New Hampshire so
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
certainly there's no problem with access
 
01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
to flu shots for children
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
my second objection to the bill is that
 
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
vaccines given in a pharmacy should be
 
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
limited to vaccines for which actual FDA
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
license has been given and for those
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
individuals For Whom the CDC has
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines according to the
 
01:39:34.129 --> 01:39:34.139 align:start position:0%
details of the cdc's ever-changing
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
recommended adult vaccine schedule
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy is not the place to be giving
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
experimental vaccines like the coveted
 
01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
shots for which there is only FDA
 
01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization given and
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
not FDA license
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
and my third and final objection to this
 
01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
bill has been mentioned here is it and
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I think maybe there's a resolution
 
01:39:58.129 --> 01:39:58.139 align:start position:0%
to it that it cannot be required that a
 
01:39:58.139 --> 01:39:59.629 align:start position:0%
to it that it cannot be required that a
pharmacist

01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
pharmacist
 
01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:03.179 align:start position:0%
um enter a customer's information into
 
01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
the state vaccine registry because that
 
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
is a voluntary program and it is the
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
customer in the pharmacy who can who's
 
01:40:12.530 --> 01:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
the controlling person whether that
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
would get entered or not so I appreciate
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
recognition of that concern and for
 
01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
these reasons I oppose this bill is
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
written thank you very much for your
 
01:40:21.239 --> 01:40:22.070 align:start position:0%
written thank you very much for your
time

01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
will will you take questions I certainly
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
may I have one I'm a little confused
 
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
about your point number one because as I
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
am reading the bill uh it says on line
 
01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
four immunos immunizing pharmacist and
 
01:40:40.729 --> 01:40:40.739 align:start position:0%
it has some helpers up there previously
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
may administer influenza vaccines to the
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
general public lots of lots and lots of
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
line seven to individuals 18 years of
 
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
age and older
 
01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
so I think that obviates your 0.1 unless
 
01:40:59.810 --> 01:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it wrong
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
actually and I I believe that what it's
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
doing is it's doing a carve out here
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
that the the reason that the influenza
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
vaccines are mentioned separately is
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
because that would be for the general
 
01:41:14.209 --> 01:41:14.219 align:start position:0%
public at any age but all other vaccines
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
would be limited to those age 18 and
 
01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.810 align:start position:0%
would be limited to those age 18 and
older

01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
older
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that representative
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
Merchant can correct me if I
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
misunderstand that well I'm really
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
looking for representative Weber's third
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
and fifth grade teacher here because it
 
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
is a linguistic thing and we can't bring
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
up the build sponsor to answer at this
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
point but we can bring up anybody else
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
who's learned to read on the committee
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
so am I correct or am I misreading it
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
that lines three to seven limit
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
flu vaccines to those 18 years and older
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
am I correct representative Cushman
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
the way that I read it
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
um is the way that Laura Conan reads it
 
01:42:04.129 --> 01:42:04.139 align:start position:0%
I see that that is for the general
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
public for the influenza vaccine and
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
then the 18 years or older applies to
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
all the other vaccines approved by the
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
CDC as written in the bill well I can't
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
call Representative Merchant back up but
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
what I will do is ask him to make the
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
wording a little clearer so we know
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
exactly what you mean and I'm quite
 
01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:31.139 align:start position:0%
happy to be proven wrong but you've got
 
01:42:34.129 --> 01:42:34.139 align:start position:0%
to prove it and I'm sure representative
 
01:42:39.169 --> 01:42:39.179 align:start position:0%
uh oh I didn't promote you uh Miss uh
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
Condon Miss Condon
 
01:42:42.770 --> 01:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
um you've done a lot of work in this so
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
if representative Merchant could clarify
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
that linguistic question for me at least
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
um Miss Condon do you see
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
um any issue with opening it up to the
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that are on the adult
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
um CDC schedule
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
in addition to the ones that are
 
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
explicitly mentioned in the statute
 
01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:25.310 align:start position:0%
explicitly mentioned in the statute
currently

01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I appreciate that question it gives
 
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
me an opportunity to clarify further as
 
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
I do know that um it has been stated by
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is that pharmacists can
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
currently give I think eight or ten
 
01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:39.020 align:start position:0%
different vaccines but in fact the law
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
specifically limits it to influenza
 
01:43:44.810 --> 01:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
pneumococcal and varicella zoster so
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
which is which is only three which is
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
which is what is listed in the law now
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
and that's being you know crossed out in
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and then expanding it to all
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines recommended for adults
 
01:43:59.450 --> 01:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
um you know as long as it's age 18 and
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
over you know represent Cushman you know
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
I mean I think it's buyer beware you
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
know it's up to the consumer to do their
 
01:44:07.609 --> 01:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
adult you know their diligence I mean
 
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
these are adults
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
um this is an access issue to vaccines
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
um and you know I I wouldn't curtail
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
that personally I wouldn't curtail that
 
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.890 align:start position:0%
that personally I wouldn't curtail that
access

01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow-up one follow-up
 
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Condon
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm just I'm gonna point you to
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
the uh line in the bill it's section two
 
01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
where it says repeal RSA 318 16d
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
um that one actually does it's in a
 
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
separate section but it's like a repeat
 
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
of this section for the specifically
 
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
hepatitis A B MMR
 
01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:48.830 align:start position:0%
hepatitis A B MMR
um

01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
and a couple of other vaccines so they
 
01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:53.699 align:start position:0%
are just to let you know that they are
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
sorry that's not a question uh well you
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
got to learn the Art of Faking us out by

saying wouldn't you believe or haven't
 
01:45:10.729 --> 01:45:10.739 align:start position:0%

01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else well thank you thank you

again you're one of our go-to people
 
01:45:28.129 --> 01:45:28.139 align:start position:0%
here on these matters
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman um and members
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:40.860 align:start position:0%

policy coordinator at new Futures new
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
Futures is a nonpartisan non-profit

wellness of all New Hampshire residents
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
in this role we work extensively with
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
policy makers Health Care Providers and
 
01:45:59.930 --> 01:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
families to increase access to quality
 
01:46:02.209 --> 01:46:02.219 align:start position:0%
affordable health care including access
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
to important vaccines throughout the
 
01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
granite state Futures appreciates the
 
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on House Bill
 
01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:10.310 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on House Bill
572.

01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
572.
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
this bill not only expands on pharmacies
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
staff allowed to administer vaccines but
 
01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
it expands on the types of vaccines they
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
are able to provide to the public
 
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
this bill would expand that capacity to
 
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
all CDC approved vaccines for adults and
 
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 vaccine for children and
 
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
adults when it is readily available
 
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
while new Futures certainly supports
 
01:46:34.729 --> 01:46:34.739 align:start position:0%
increased access to vaccines for all
 
01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters to do so while not
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
knowing how affordable that access would
 
01:46:41.689 --> 01:46:41.699 align:start position:0%
be is problematic
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
while understanding that this testimony
 
01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
is on House Bill 572 it would be remiss
 
01:46:50.689 --> 01:46:50.699 align:start position:0%
not to mention the intersection of this
 
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
bill with House Bill 604 and house bill
 
01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.250 align:start position:0%
bill with House Bill 604 and house bill
221.

01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
221.
 
01:46:58.010 --> 01:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
the intent of House Bill 604 is to
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
increase access to vaccines while
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
reducing costs to the overall health
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
care System
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies have resisted being
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
involved in the proposed expansion of
 
01:47:09.410 --> 01:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
the state's vaccine program to include
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
adults however they are asking you to
 
01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
expand the scope of their vaccine
 
01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:15.109 align:start position:0%
expand the scope of their vaccine
practice

01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
additionally having pedia pediatric
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines administered through
 
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies could undermine the
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
successful and well-functioning
 
01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
children's vaccine program that has
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
existed for nearly nearly two decades
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
additionally this bill removes the
 
01:47:33.169 --> 01:47:33.179 align:start position:0%
requirement as has been mentioned
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
earlier for pharmacies to notify a
 
01:47:37.729 --> 01:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
patient's primary care physician about
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines given relying solely on the
 
01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
pharmacists entering the information
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
into the state's vaccine registry
 
01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
and while I do believe
 
01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
um some sort of a fix has been discussed
 
01:47:53.090 --> 01:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
here my testimony was drafted is in
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
consideration of the bill as uh as
 
01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.930 align:start position:0%
consideration of the bill as uh as
introduced

01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
but House Bill 572
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
um in its existing form would need House
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
Bill 221 to be found in expedient to
 
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
legislate for it to function in a way
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh that the patient receives continuity
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
of his or her health care and not um
 
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
only that um but in listening to the
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
testimony here today as well
 
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
um even if the registry was an opt-out
 
01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:25.189 align:start position:0%
um even if the registry was an opt-out
alternative

01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:48:28.370 --> 01:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
those who are who decide to opt out of
 
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
the registry because they don't want
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
their uh information maintained in a
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
public registry held at the state they
 
01:48:38.689 --> 01:48:38.699 align:start position:0%
still may want their doctor to know and
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that it's good enough to
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
just say well then it's on the the
 
01:48:46.609 --> 01:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
shoulder of that uh patient to let the
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh their provider to know as
 
01:48:51.649 --> 01:48:51.659 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
um discussed not all individuals have
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians and for those
 
01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
who currently don't have one
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
um end up getting a number of vaccines
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacy and then two years later
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
obtain a primary care physician they may
 
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
not remember what vaccines they received
 
01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacy so
 
01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:13.669 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacy so
um

01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:13.679 --> 01:49:15.290 align:start position:0%
um
okay

01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
also they may not remember even two
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
weeks later when they have an
 
01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:23.219 align:start position:0%
appointment with the primary care
 
01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
provider if they have one to let that
 
01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
provider know that they receive vaccines
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
it may not be high on their priority
 
01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
list if they're dealing with other
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
medical concerns
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
um so until the overall impact of this
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is known given its
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
intersection with other bills that the
 
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
house is currently considering new
 
01:49:45.169 --> 01:49:45.179 align:start position:0%
Futures takes no position on this bill
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
at this time instead new Futures simply
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
urges the committee to fully assess the
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
ramifications of House Bill 572
 
01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
especially in conjunction with House
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 604 in House Bill 221 before
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
proceeding forward with the bill
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
this assessment should include any
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
potential impact to the overall cost of
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
to the Health Care system and I didn't
 
01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
mention this in my written testimony but
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
inequality issues too I'm there were a
 
01:50:15.590 --> 01:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
number of quality issues that have come
 
01:50:16.729 --> 01:50:16.739 align:start position:0%
to surface
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%

suggestions talk to representative
Merchants

01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
Merchants
 
01:52:01.739 --> 01:52:02.470 align:start position:0%
Merchants
um

01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
and uh I might suggest and it's only a
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
suggestion that a bill of this number of
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
lines which is to me a small bill
 
01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
um 30 on one page one on the other
 
01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
um by the time you cut and paste an
 
01:52:20.810 --> 01:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
amendment should go here and an
 
01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
amendment should go there allow me to
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
suggest that you write an amendment that
 
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
starts off roughly with the words after
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
the enacting Clause replace the whole
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
darn thing with the following I mean you
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that exactly but that's
 
01:52:40.129 --> 01:52:40.139 align:start position:0%
what it would want to say so that way we
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
look at a clean copy we look at the bill
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
as you have worked through what you wish
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
to take from the suggestions of various
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
people rather than having to draw arrows
 
01:52:53.590 --> 01:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
and scissors and paste and so on
 
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for that advice Mr chairman
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
well something I learned the hard way
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
like most things
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
anyway let's
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
say let's break folks
 
01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
then with
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.100 --> 01:55:40.189 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:40.199 --> 01:56:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.040 --> 01:57:30.350 align:start position:0%
 
everything

01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.360 --> 01:58:37.189 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.199 --> 01:59:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:37.310 align:start position:0%
 
before

01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:42.589 align:start position:0%
before
chairman

01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:08.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:00:08.450 --> 02:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to note for your
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
information that as I look out the
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
window the ice here is beginning to
 
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
build up fairly alarmingly so if I
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
vanish I will do my very best to find a
 
02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
different way back to the meeting but
 
02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:25.550 align:start position:0%
different way back to the meeting but
um

02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
it it just looks like branches are
 
02:00:32.689 --> 02:00:32.699 align:start position:0%
beginning to be weighed down a bit so I
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know thank you you're
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
in Concord you're in Concord no I'm in
 
02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
Walpole okay
 
02:00:45.129 --> 02:00:45.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
yes Walpole has not yet had any flutters
 
02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
of the electricity knock wood uh but
 
02:00:55.970 --> 02:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
Concord has so well I I looked in the uh
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
weather seven-day weather forecast
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
hoping that we might have a snowstorm
 
02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday but unfortunately it's snow
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
on Monday and we meet next week on
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so yeah
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
and Lucy one time I I did actually use
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
the cell phone
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
um it's you know it's not optimal but
 
02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's also going to be my backup
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
if the power goes out although we've got
 
02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
a generator so I should be okay but the
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
cell phone is not fun but Bill can
 
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
attest to that one but
 
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I have the um I have a generator
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
and I have an iPad
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
well I've I have a generator but that
 
02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't help me a bit if the cable goes
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
down or do I have the cables down you're
 
02:01:36.719 --> 02:01:43.030 align:start position:0%
down or do I have the cables down you're
screwed

02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
then you're good yeah
 
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I set up my phone so I can have the
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
app on my phone if I need to like Jerry
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
suggested so I won't get stuck like I
 
02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
did last time
 
02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
and I am hoping no darn it I didn't
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
manage to change the color of the hand
 
02:02:00.719 --> 02:02:02.930 align:start position:0%
manage to change the color of the hand
so

02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
I like we'll see that when the hand is
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
raised the person raising the hand if
 
02:02:11.149 --> 02:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
you're using gallery view goes to the
 
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
upper left hand corner and they show up
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the order in which they have raised
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
them so
 
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
I I have found that to be useful in
 
02:02:21.770 --> 02:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
other meetings I wanted to make my
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
raised hand look purple because then
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
everybody would see me first uh it's
 
02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:32.930 align:start position:0%
everybody would see me first uh it's
been

02:02:32.930 --> 02:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:42.129 align:start position:0%
 
boom

02:02:42.129 --> 02:02:42.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.649 --> 02:02:45.659 align:start position:0%
okay we are
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
whoops we're not
 
02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:50.089 align:start position:0%
whoops we're not
um

02:02:50.089 --> 02:02:50.099 align:start position:0%

02:03:05.770 --> 02:03:05.780 align:start position:0%

02:04:19.689 --> 02:04:19.699 align:start position:0%
to provide nicotine cessation therapy
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
let's talk about the first one health
 
02:04:24.050 --> 02:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
care provider status and why that's
 
02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:25.609 align:start position:0%
care provider status and why that's
important

02:04:25.609 --> 02:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
C Ms will only reimburse the state for
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
services provided by a recognized health
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
care provider and has to be done in
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
statute So currently when a pharmacist
 
02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
provides services that are not related
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
to the dispensing functionality
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
such as smoking sensation or other
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
things they may have within the scope of
 
02:04:49.609 --> 02:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
practice they cannot build Medicaid and
 
02:04:50.930 --> 02:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
the reason why they can't build Medicaid
 
02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
is Medicaid can't go to the CMS at the
 
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
federal level and seek reimbursement
 
02:04:58.070 --> 02:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
which is normally about 50 of the cost
 
02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
so what this bill fundamentally does is
 
02:05:03.169 --> 02:05:03.179 align:start position:0%
recognize pharmacists as health care
 
02:05:06.649 --> 02:05:06.659 align:start position:0%
providers which therefore allows
 
02:05:11.930 --> 02:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
secretly reimbursement from the federal
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
government on the provision of what's
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
provided by the pharmacists within the
 
02:05:20.089 --> 02:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
scope of practice so it's a simple fix
 
02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
that basically allow for that to occur
 
02:05:24.290 --> 02:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
and for the state itself to get at least
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
50 percent of it back from the federal
 
02:05:26.159 --> 02:05:28.129 align:start position:0%
50 percent of it back from the federal
government

02:05:28.129 --> 02:05:28.139 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
the other one is about smoking sensation
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
which is really kind of a an important
 
02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:34.250 align:start position:0%
which is really kind of a an important
part

02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
part
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at the U.S
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
Surgeon General the report in 2020. one
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
of the things that was brought out by
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
is a major contributor to health care
 
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
cost because of all the disease and so
 
02:05:56.330 --> 02:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
forth related to it
 
02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do which is what
 
02:06:00.649 --> 02:06:00.659 align:start position:0%
the report stated was to make it as
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
broadly available to patients
 
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
to have access to products that would
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
help the patient
 
02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
to quit smoking
 
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
there's numerous studies that show that
 
02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
it takes multiple times sometimes for
 
02:06:20.209 --> 02:06:20.219 align:start position:0%
that to occur but the primary reason is
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
the patient has to decide when they want
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
to quit and trying to take advantage of
 
02:06:27.649 --> 02:06:27.659 align:start position:0%
that by allowing the patient to have
 
02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
access easy access timely access
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
to a therapy will help immensely in
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
compliance with the patient to make the
 
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
decision to take themselves off from
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:46.850 --> 02:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
so the 10 here is twofold one is to
 
02:06:48.649 --> 02:06:48.659 align:start position:0%
increase the reimbursement through the
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system for the services
 
02:06:53.930 --> 02:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
provided and number two to Simply allow
 
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacists to provide smoking sensation
 
02:06:58.750 --> 02:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
therapy nicotine replacement
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
schedule of the patient versus
 
02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
otherwise so
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
we know that access is a primary issue
 
02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
timely access is important and all this
 
02:07:15.169 --> 02:07:15.179 align:start position:0%
does is fundamentally allow the
 
02:07:18.290 --> 02:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to provide that access point
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
for the patient to pick up
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
nicotine replacement therapy at their
 
02:07:25.010 --> 02:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
discretion when they feel comfortable to
 
02:07:27.649 --> 02:07:27.659 align:start position:0%
do it number two when you look at the
 
02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%
number of times a pharmacist interacts
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
with a patient
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown that most patients
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
they go in Medicare visit a pharmacy
 
02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
twice as often as a primary care so
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're an ideal situation
 
02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
to identify patients or look and help
 
02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
through a conversation with the patient
 
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
to encourage them to actually take and
 
02:07:52.129 --> 02:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
stop smoking but again it's one thing to
 
02:07:54.410 --> 02:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
say to stop smoking but to be able to
 
02:07:56.570 --> 02:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
give them a product that will actually
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
help them quit the nicotine Cravings
 
02:08:01.010 --> 02:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
that the body incurs when you're onto a
 
02:08:03.169 --> 02:08:03.179 align:start position:0%
nicotine product like tobacco so that's
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill it's
 
02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
fundamentally to allow for reimbursement
 
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
into allow pharmacists to have the
 
02:08:12.050 --> 02:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
ability to help patients in their quest
 
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
to stop smoking
 
02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:15.830 align:start position:0%
to stop smoking
thanks

02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's all opened up for questions
 
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham well thank
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I know some people take shantex if I
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
pronounce that correctly to stop smoking
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
would a pharmacist be able to distribute
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.810 --> 02:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
if it's approved by the FDA for that
 
02:08:41.810 --> 02:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
reason yes they would so the law only
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
allows the pharmacist to provide to a
 
02:08:46.370 --> 02:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
patient products approved by the FDA
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
which have an indication for smoking
 
02:08:50.330 --> 02:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
sensation so if the product does not
 
02:08:52.370 --> 02:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
have that indication by the
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
VA the pharmacist would not be able to
 
02:08:58.930 --> 02:08:58.940 align:start position:0%
provide it okay thank you thank you
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative snow please unmute and
 
02:09:12.609 --> 02:09:12.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:15.169 --> 02:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative snow you're still on mute
 
02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.209 --> 02:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
my unbuted now you're good you're good
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
now okay should I sorry about that you
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
start over you can start all right I'll
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
start all over thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant for
 
02:09:35.649 --> 02:09:35.659 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
I just need to be assured that what's on
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
page one lines three
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
through six which basically gives carte
 
02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
blanche the pharmacists to perform any
 
02:09:50.689 --> 02:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
services that are provided by positions
 
02:09:55.370 --> 02:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
or uh business or ar andps and yet they
 
02:09:58.070 --> 02:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
don't mention any specific services at
 
02:10:00.589 --> 02:10:00.599 align:start position:0%
kamanda but I think that gets clarified
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken uh
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
where it does describe that it needs to
 
02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
be done under a prescription from a
 
02:10:13.609 --> 02:10:13.619 align:start position:0%
pharmacist or an A rnp but in other
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
words they have to order that specific
 
02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:16.510 align:start position:0%
words they have to order that specific
treatment

02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:10:19.490 --> 02:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
smoking sensation and it wouldn't also
 
02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
allow this pharmacist to do heart
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
surgery or something else that a
 
02:10:25.010 --> 02:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
physician could could do or any other
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
Medical Practice am I correct in that
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
assumption that this is not Cod Blanche
 
02:10:32.089 --> 02:10:32.099 align:start position:0%
but it needs to be specifically ordered
 
02:10:36.609 --> 02:10:36.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.619 --> 02:10:38.450 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and I will
 
02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:42.050 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and I will
clarify

02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
um the ability for the pharmacist to
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
provide a product because twofold one is
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
the authority to provide it but also
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
they work under a standing order from a
 
02:10:54.169 --> 02:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
provider so they don't have individual
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
prescribing Authority they work under
 
02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
the standing order of a physician or
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner and also there's a
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
Statewide protocol developed by the
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine the Board of Nursing
 
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
the born of
 
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
um nursing medical and also the
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services so
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
the protocol which is what they would
 
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
follow is Guided by those respective
 
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
boards and the Department of Health
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services as well as the authority
 
02:11:22.669 --> 02:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
to do it flows through a provider
 
02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
through a standing order
 
02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
okay an outstanding order has to be very
 
02:11:27.420 --> 02:11:28.490 align:start position:0%
okay an outstanding order has to be very
specific

02:11:28.490 --> 02:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
in this case it would not necessarily
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
extend anything not named an outstanding
 
02:11:35.930 --> 02:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
order that would ordinarily be provided
 
02:11:40.729 --> 02:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
correct that's
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
so basically standing water which is
 
02:11:47.089 --> 02:11:47.099 align:start position:0%
what the physician is providing was
 
02:11:50.209 --> 02:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
specified to that fix exactly and then
 
02:11:52.810 --> 02:11:52.820 align:start position:0%
what it normally says is that the
 
02:11:55.729 --> 02:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to their Authority could
 
02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
follow the protocol as this protocol
 
02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:00.410 align:start position:0%
follow the protocol as this protocol
written

02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much those boundaries
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's not allowing them card blocks to
 
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
do anything yes thank you
 
02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Woods
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:12:15.169 --> 02:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant for taking my
 
02:12:15.179 --> 02:12:16.490 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant for taking my
question

02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
um we discussed this some time ago and
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
I've I've forgotten how this came out so
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
my apologies for asking the question
 
02:12:26.570 --> 02:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
again uh but that refers to the standing
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
order which is introduced on page two
 
02:12:31.609 --> 02:12:31.619 align:start position:0%
line 17.
 
02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
um I need clarification again uh exactly
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
how that's structured uh and how it's
 
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
interfaced with uh the uh primary care
 
02:12:43.970 --> 02:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
and his physician
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
um and I have a follow-up depending upon
 
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
basically my question is how is that
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
standing order promulgated
 
02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
and how is it instituted
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
I mean who who uh there's a standing
 
02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
order and I'm a primary care did I write
 
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
it is it a standing order written for
 
02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
each individual Primary Care
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh if it's not if it's written by
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else an agency
 
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
um what uh what's the ability for a
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
individual Primary Care to shall we say
 
02:13:27.530 --> 02:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
opt-in or opt out
 
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:47.689 --> 02:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
that's why I was talking so well
 
02:13:50.990 --> 02:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
so given the fact that today patients
 
02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:52.690 align:start position:0%
see multiple providers
 
02:13:52.690 --> 02:13:54.410 align:start position:0%
see multiple providers

[Music]
 
02:13:56.810 --> 02:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
um which pharmacists are basically in
 
02:13:58.609 --> 02:13:58.619 align:start position:0%
this instance becoming part of the
 
02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
healthcare team
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
we don't require the
 
02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
position of the provider if you go to to
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
notify the primary care if they want to
 
02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
treat the patient
 
02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
um it's not built into the system today
 
02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
again back to my father who sees a
 
02:14:16.970 --> 02:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
cardiologist who sees a dermatologist
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
and sees a
 
02:14:20.810 --> 02:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
pulmonologists and so forth the
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
pulmonologist doesn't call the primary
 
02:14:24.649 --> 02:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
care to initiate therapy there's
 
02:14:26.209 --> 02:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
probably communication back with the
 
02:14:29.450 --> 02:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
primary care but it's not required
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
the issue we're trying to talk to I
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
think is a fragmentation of Health Care
 
02:14:35.689 --> 02:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
system that we're involved with today
 
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
and what we're trying to do
 
02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
fundamentally is not to
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
build barriers up to it but accept
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
what's in place that we have today that
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
allows for multiple providers to help
 
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
treat a patient this is a particular
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
case to talk about smoking therapy
 
02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:52.370 align:start position:0%
case to talk about smoking therapy
sensation

02:14:52.370 --> 02:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
sensation
 
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
um at that point in time because you're
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
working understanding order the
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
authority flows through that
 
02:15:00.830 --> 02:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
position just like you would in the
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
other position
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
and as far as getting back to what
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get to is when he
 
02:15:08.089 --> 02:15:08.099 align:start position:0%
the standing order comes from the
 
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
physician so that standing order would
 
02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
therefore have to come
 
02:15:13.010 --> 02:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
not So Much from the primary care
 
02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
document from the position that the
 
02:15:17.689 --> 02:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
patient's coming under which should be
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
the person running the standing order
 
02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
taking the authority from that point of
 
02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:26.149 align:start position:0%
taking the authority from that point of
view

02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and I go back to what I mentioned
 
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
before with the system we have today
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's not always the ideal system but it
 
02:15:38.450 --> 02:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:44.689 align:start position:0%

representative Shapiro has his hand up
 
02:15:57.050 --> 02:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
um I know the first part of the bill
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
recognizes pharmacists as providers for
 
02:16:06.169 --> 02:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
the purposes of Medicaid State
 
02:16:06.179 --> 02:16:08.629 align:start position:0%
the purposes of Medicaid State
reimbursement

02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
02:16:12.770 --> 02:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
um does this bill also
 
02:16:15.890 --> 02:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
imply that pharmacists will be able to
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed for
 
02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
prescribing smoking cessation therapies
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
I know they're not technically
 
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
prescribing it but
 
02:16:27.770 --> 02:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
um through a standing order would it
 
02:16:30.069 --> 02:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
allow them to be reimbursed
 
02:16:33.549 --> 02:16:33.559 align:start position:0%
yes it would allow them to be in work
 
02:16:35.530 --> 02:16:35.540 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for the
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation because when you look at the
 
02:16:40.370 --> 02:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
patient coming in what the pharmacist is
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
going to have to do is sit down with
 
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
that protocol
 
02:16:45.290 --> 02:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
and go through that protocol with the
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
patient to be sure the patient in fact
 
02:16:49.610 --> 02:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
meets the criteria within the protocol
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
and that takes time so therefore that
 
02:16:54.530 --> 02:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
time element would be built to Medicaid
 
02:16:57.469 --> 02:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
the dispensing of the product who so
 
02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
desired to do that would not be a
 
02:17:02.810 --> 02:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
a service patient care service it'd be a
 
02:17:04.910 --> 02:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
dispensing function so this allows for
 
02:17:07.370 --> 02:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist to be reimbursed with the
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
time element that they need to do it
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately to be sure the patient
 
02:17:13.490 --> 02:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
meets the criteria within the protocol
 
02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
if the patient doesn't meet the criteria
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
within a protocol then the pharmacist
 
02:17:20.209 --> 02:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
would therefore make a referral to a
 
02:17:22.129 --> 02:17:22.139 align:start position:0%
provider because it goes beyond the
 
02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
constraints within the protocol
 
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you could I have a follow-up
 
02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:28.490 align:start position:0%
thank you could I have a follow-up
follow-up

02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
um so would that
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
work through private insurers as well or
 
02:17:35.810 --> 02:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
just through Medicaid
 
02:17:39.049 --> 02:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
um this is only dealing with Medicaid
 
02:17:39.059 --> 02:17:40.070 align:start position:0%
um this is only dealing with Medicaid
okay

02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up one more follow-up
 
02:17:46.490 --> 02:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay so in trying to understand the
 
02:17:48.770 --> 02:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
standing order
 
02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
um the standing order is not given by
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
the primary care doctor but does each
 
02:17:57.650 --> 02:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy have a specific standing order
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
from a specific doctor or is there just
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
a Statewide standing order
 
02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question representative
 
02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
Shapiro we don't use the Statewide
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
standing order when we do use it in
 
02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
naloxone so for instance in naloxone the
 
02:18:16.429 --> 02:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
department Health and Human Services
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
issued a standing order at the state
 
02:18:22.129 --> 02:18:22.139 align:start position:0%
level so all pharmacies can therefore
 
02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:26.519 align:start position:0%
provide naloxone Narcan to a patients or
 
02:18:29.089 --> 02:18:29.099 align:start position:0%
family members that may have an issue
 
02:18:32.089 --> 02:18:32.099 align:start position:0%
with opium opiate addiction
 
02:18:34.129 --> 02:18:34.139 align:start position:0%
um this one here is more specific than
 
02:18:36.889 --> 02:18:36.899 align:start position:0%
that it's not broadly written so that it
 
02:18:39.410 --> 02:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
covers the whole state The Physician
 
02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
that does it with covering only those
 
02:18:43.490 --> 02:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
that are under the
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
direction of the pharmacist so in other
 
02:18:45.719 --> 02:18:46.790 align:start position:0%
direction of the pharmacist so in other
words

02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
words
 
02:18:49.969 --> 02:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
if you're writing a standing order
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
only the ones that can use the standing
 
02:18:53.570 --> 02:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
order the ones that are coming under the
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
standing order by the provider it's not
 
02:18:57.049 --> 02:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
Statewide it's specific to whether the
 
02:18:59.209 --> 02:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
provider wants to do so if the provider
 
02:19:01.370 --> 02:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
wants to make it General they could but
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
if they want to make it narrow they
 
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
could too they could specify within the
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
standing order they only want these
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacists to be part of it or they can
 
02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
make it Broad and say I'll think around
 
02:19:10.849 --> 02:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for the community at
 
02:19:10.859 --> 02:19:14.030 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for the community at
Large

02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.169 --> 02:19:17.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
I guess I need to clarify something
 
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
really basic and that is by making the
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacist a provider at least to
 
02:19:34.009 --> 02:19:34.019 align:start position:0%
Medicaid people
 
02:19:37.129 --> 02:19:37.139 align:start position:0%
that's another clarification I need by
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
making the pharmacist the provider that
 
02:19:43.810 --> 02:19:43.820 align:start position:0%
means they can order the the
 
02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:46.139 align:start position:0%
prescription they can write the
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
prescription to use the standing order
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
so that's question one
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
and question two is
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
what exactly is considered nicotine
 
02:20:00.349 --> 02:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
cessation therapy because it says means
 
02:20:00.359 --> 02:20:01.969 align:start position:0%
cessation therapy because it says means
medications

02:20:01.969 --> 02:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
medications
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
and the medications are either with
 
02:20:06.530 --> 02:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
prescription or without and if you don't
 
02:20:09.050 --> 02:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
need a prescription
 
02:20:11.929 --> 02:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
what exactly is nicotine cessation is
 
02:20:13.849 --> 02:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
there any counseling involved in this is
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
this just writing a prescription
 
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay let me so the first question
 
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
the authority to prescribe is not
 
02:20:31.969 --> 02:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
independent the but the authority to
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
prescribe and it's really not
 
02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
prescribing in a sense but to order the
 
02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:36.050 align:start position:0%
prescribing in a sense but to order the
medication

02:20:36.050 --> 02:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
medication
 
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
flows through a provider so it's going
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
through a physician or a nurse
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
practitioner so the pharmacist is not
 
02:20:44.690 --> 02:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
independently have that Authority they
 
02:20:46.849 --> 02:20:46.859 align:start position:0%
have to work with a provider or a nurse
 
02:20:46.859 --> 02:20:48.170 align:start position:0%
have to work with a provider or a nurse
practitioner

02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
so they are the ones that assigned to
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist The Authority under their
 
02:20:58.849 --> 02:20:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
to order the product to corrects in
 
02:21:03.889 --> 02:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
other words they only can do it if
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
they're given Authority by the physician
 
02:21:08.570 --> 02:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
through the standing order so they
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
cannot do an independent of a provider
 
02:21:13.969 --> 02:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
so their Authority flows as a subset
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
under the provider they don't do it
 
02:21:16.439 --> 02:21:20.469 align:start position:0%
under the provider they don't do it
independently

02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to follow up representative
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
gay are you okay yes thank you uh does
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
this mean that the provider through whom
 
02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:31.190 align:start position:0%
this mean that the provider through whom
it

02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
okay it sounds like a pharmacist has an
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
agreement with the um provider that they
 
02:21:40.730 --> 02:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
can use a standing order
 
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
which brings up to me a question like
 
02:21:46.969 --> 02:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
does the person who's asking for this
 
02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
treatment are they is this their
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
provider or is this just a provider who
 
02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
has given authority to a pharmacist
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
without regard for who the person is who
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.479 --> 02:22:04.849 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:22:04.849 --> 02:22:04.859 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
The Authority flows again back to the
 
02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:09.170 align:start position:0%
The Authority flows again back to the
provider

02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of
 
02:22:14.750 --> 02:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
oh in other words
 
02:22:17.090 --> 02:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say this when you when a
 
02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
patient comes in and has the therapy
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
what the standing order does through the
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
provider is say if a patient comes into
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
your Pharmacy
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'll give you authority to treat that
 
02:22:31.969 --> 02:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
patient but you have to do it with the
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
constraints of that protocol
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
if you don't follow the protocol you
 
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
don't have any Authority so at that
 
02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
point in time is the position or the
 
02:22:42.410 --> 02:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner is granting the
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacist the ability to treat the
 
02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:45.290 align:start position:0%
pharmacist the ability to treat the
patient

02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:22:49.610 --> 02:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.370 --> 02:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
they can't they can't that's a gay they
 
02:22:53.929 --> 02:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
cannot as a pharmacist they cannot
 
02:22:55.849 --> 02:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
deviate from that protocol it's
 
02:22:57.530 --> 02:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
basically an algorithm they have to go
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
down through it's a checklist
 
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
to be sure that patient qualifies for
 
02:23:03.469 --> 02:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
the therapy
 
02:23:05.690 --> 02:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
but the authority flows back to a
 
02:23:09.410 --> 02:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:12.070 --> 02:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
okay and my first question
 
02:23:16.330 --> 02:23:16.340 align:start position:0%
uh can you my second question
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
what com what comprises nicotine
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
cessation therapy other than just
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
ordering a medication well this is
 
02:23:27.889 --> 02:23:27.899 align:start position:0%
another quirk in the Medicaid system
 
02:23:30.590 --> 02:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recognizes that nicotine
 
02:23:34.130 --> 02:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
cessation products to help a patient
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
get off from tobacco products can be
 
02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
over the counter as well as prescription
 
02:23:43.130 --> 02:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
however Medicaid will only pay for a
 
02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:44.389 align:start position:0%
however Medicaid will only pay for a
medication

02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
medication
 
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
if it's ordered by a provider so if the
 
02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
patient decides to get nicotine patches
 
02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
instead of them having to reach into
 
02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
their pocket which becomes a barrier
 
02:23:55.849 --> 02:23:55.859 align:start position:0%
Financial barrier what the state
 
02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
recognizes that we want them off the
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
tobacco because it's in the best
 
02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
interest of the state both economically
 
02:24:04.130 --> 02:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
and for the patient health-wise is if
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
the provider authorizes it the state
 
02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
will pay for it
 
02:24:11.690 --> 02:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
so it's a quirk in the system it's in a
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
lot of ways it's the same way with
 
02:24:15.170 --> 02:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
health care insurance today if you have
 
02:24:17.330 --> 02:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
an over-the-counter product sometimes
 
02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
the insurance company will pay for it
 
02:24:20.690 --> 02:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes they won't but if it's not
 
02:24:23.809 --> 02:24:23.819 align:start position:0%
something in which a providers
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
ordering for you in some capacity they
 
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
won't pay for it so it's one of those
 
02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
things where we're trying to write it
 
02:24:32.450 --> 02:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
and saying whether it's over-the-counter
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
or a prescription reps of gay then
 
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to the pharmacist for the
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
product as well the service would
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
would occur and we're trying to
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
encourage again back to the same thing
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
we talked about before it's not just the
 
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
assessment of the patients also the
 
02:24:49.610 --> 02:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
counseling that goes with it so it's
 
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
time consuming
 
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
um when you start looking at the
 
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
engagement with the patient
 
02:24:56.570 --> 02:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
we want to be sure that the pharmacist
 
02:24:58.849 --> 02:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
is fairly compensated for the additional
 
02:25:00.530 --> 02:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
time that they have to take with the
 
02:25:02.210 --> 02:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
patient to do it safely and
 
02:25:04.250 --> 02:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
appropriately so that they have the
 
02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
counseling and they have the right
 
02:25:07.849 --> 02:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
product they need to try to get to the
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
end result which is getting off the
 
02:25:14.929 --> 02:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:16.929 --> 02:25:16.939 align:start position:0%
we're going to move on to the chair
 
02:25:21.889 --> 02:25:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:23.570 --> 02:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
yeah you right I didn't realize that was
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
up next
 
02:25:26.570 --> 02:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for taking my
 
02:25:30.830 --> 02:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
question so on page two uh lines 20
 
02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:31.370 align:start position:0%
question so on page two uh lines 20
um

02:25:31.370 --> 02:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:36.349 --> 02:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
6 through 29 which precludes uh it
 
02:25:37.790 --> 02:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
prohibits seeking first personal
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
financial benefit with incentive-based
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
programs which I think is great wish we
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
had it for surgeons um but in any case
 
02:25:46.130 --> 02:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
um there because there is a bit of a
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest with a vertical
 
02:25:48.889 --> 02:25:48.899 align:start position:0%
Monopoly where you decide that the
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
patient should get it and also you
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
provide it so does this
 
02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:53.450 align:start position:0%
provide it so does this
um

02:25:53.450 --> 02:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
sentence apply to only outside
 
02:25:57.650 --> 02:25:57.660 align:start position:0%
inducements like from a company that
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
makes them or does this also apply to
 
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
the metrics that might occur in the
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacy lighting compensation based uh
 
02:26:08.929 --> 02:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
on the productivity of the pharmacist
 
02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's a good question representative
 
02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:11.870 align:start position:0%
that's a good question representative
knurk

02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
knurk
 
02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
um the language in there applies to all
 
02:26:15.290 --> 02:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
providers including Physicians and nurse
 
02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
practitioners so therefore whatever is
 
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
applicable to a provider uh be a
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
physician nurse practitioner and so
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
forth as far as the disincentives that
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
we're talking about would be equal
 
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
across the board so all parties follow
 
02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
the same rules and regulations
 
02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
so if a physician is in the office
 
02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
could do the same thing where all of a
 
02:26:40.730 --> 02:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
sudden a patient comes in and they
 
02:26:43.610 --> 02:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
robotica look at and saying I'll give or
 
02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
do something for the patient
 
02:26:46.610 --> 02:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
procedure-wise and so forth because I'll
 
02:26:48.050 --> 02:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
get extra Revenue
 
02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're the intent here
 
02:26:51.530 --> 02:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
but it's nothing to prevent a provider
 
02:26:54.650 --> 02:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
from over doing things for a patient
 
02:26:54.660 --> 02:26:58.150 align:start position:0%
from over doing things for a patient
either

02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
but I I agree but would you like a
 
02:27:04.130 --> 02:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up sorry I agree my apologies I
 
02:27:06.889 --> 02:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
agree but my question is what about
 
02:27:09.290 --> 02:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
um other incentive programs for
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement within the pharmacies
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
based on Pharmacy pharmacist
 
02:27:15.530 --> 02:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
productivity in terms of the number of
 
02:27:17.809 --> 02:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
people they either interact with or that
 
02:27:19.490 --> 02:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
proceed on to the
 
02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:21.950 align:start position:0%
proceed on to the
intervention

02:27:21.950 --> 02:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm asking
 
02:27:26.570 --> 02:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
no I I think
 
02:27:28.250 --> 02:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of I think is
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way we're all
 
02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
including providers and Physicians
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
offices we all have people that look at
 
02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
our productivity and say you know are
 
02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
you generating enough Revenue to support
 
02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
yourself I mean it's very much a common
 
02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
in medical
 
02:27:42.530 --> 02:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
um where I worked before because a lot
 
02:27:44.270 --> 02:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
of doctors were measured by their rvu's
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
relative value units and if they didn't
 
02:27:48.170 --> 02:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
have enough rbus which is kind of the
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
same thing in a lot where you'll be
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
billable hours someone had to talk to
 
02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:53.389 align:start position:0%
billable hours someone had to talk to
you

02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:27:55.849 --> 02:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
so I I don't like it but it could
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
possibly be there yeah
 
02:28:01.490 --> 02:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
want another follow-up please yeah yes
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you it's a problem so
 
02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
here's a question too though that
 
02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
relates to the same issue if a patient
 
02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
comes in to fill a prescription for they
 
02:28:11.570 --> 02:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
were lisinopril or something is the
 
02:28:13.849 --> 02:28:13.859 align:start position:0%
pharmacist allowed to solicit uh and ask
 
02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
them about are you having any
 
02:28:16.969 --> 02:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
difficulties with tobacco and you like
 
02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
to participate in nicotine cessation or
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
must be a patient initiate the visit for
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
that purpose of nicotine cessation wow
 
02:28:28.250 --> 02:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
good I would say that's a possibility
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
but I also encourage the pharmacist
 
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
engagement with the patient because as I
 
02:28:34.849 --> 02:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned before the number of times a
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
patient goes into a pharmacy to see the
 
02:28:38.450 --> 02:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
pharmacist is probably twice as often as
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
a primary care dog they know the patient
 
02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
population I would not want to gag the
 
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacist when they recognize a patient
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
may benefit from the therapy or the fear
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
of someone saying well you're trying to
 
02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:51.899 align:start position:0%
do it for self reasons versus for the
 
02:28:54.530 --> 02:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
patients reasons it's a difficult thing
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
to tackle if I don't understand
 
02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
where you going but I would not want to
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
include in the bill some sort of a
 
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
clause in there I think we have to look
 
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
at people professionally and honorably
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
and until until otherwise that they're
 
02:29:09.889 --> 02:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
doing things best for the patient and
 
02:29:11.210 --> 02:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
not for themselves and that's kind of
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
why we're professionals I hope that
 
02:29:17.530 --> 02:29:17.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
if it could be very quick it is quick I
 
02:29:21.650 --> 02:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
think because I think it's obvious but
 
02:29:23.389 --> 02:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but thank you and I agree
 
02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
with you um you guys mentioned this is
 
02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
only Medicaid so why not including other
 
02:29:32.530 --> 02:29:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:35.929 --> 02:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
it's too complex because the Medicaid
 
02:29:35.939 --> 02:29:37.550 align:start position:0%
it's too complex because the Medicaid
system

02:29:37.550 --> 02:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:29:41.330 --> 02:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
it's just a long story that's fine very
 
02:29:43.849 --> 02:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
complex and it's not Prime Time first to
 
02:29:48.349 --> 02:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.929 --> 02:29:50.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I realized
 
02:29:52.250 --> 02:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
when I was listening to some questions
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
by representative gay that I was not
 
02:29:58.130 --> 02:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
I may have been making assumptions about
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
who we are contemplating as a provider
 
02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:03.530 align:start position:0%
who we are contemplating as a provider
um

02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
is this intended
 
02:30:11.950 --> 02:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
to be used by individual pers providers
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
prescribing for individual patients
 
02:30:16.990 --> 02:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
known to them
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
or is it intended to be uh the sort of
 
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
standing order that
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
um one of the state doctors rights is a
 
02:30:31.969 --> 02:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
Statewide thing
 
02:30:34.969 --> 02:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
or is it intended to be both
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
it could it could be either
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
um it would be nice if we could do
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
something at the state level and the um
 
02:30:44.570 --> 02:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
chief medical officer within Department
 
02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services would sign a
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
standing order which applied throughout
 
02:30:50.570 --> 02:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
the state in the past that hasn't been
 
02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
the case so it does allow for a
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
physician within it
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
the confines of whatever they want to
 
02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
control and say within this group
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
population of Pharmacists I'm okay with
 
02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
giving them the authority because they
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
have some
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
um way to direct it if I'm working in
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
the medical center and I have the
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
ability to work with pharmacists in
 
02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
outpatient setting I'm only giving out
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
authority to people within my own
 
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
organization so it could go at the state
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
level which is what I liked to occur but
 
02:31:23.210 --> 02:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
that we haven't had that successfully
 
02:31:25.250 --> 02:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
done except for naloxone but this does
 
02:31:27.050 --> 02:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
allow a physician within an organization
 
02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
to say if the pharmacist is within my
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
organization I feel comfortable and they
 
02:31:33.889 --> 02:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
can take come out of the standing order
 
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
but the position controls It ultimately
 
02:31:38.090 --> 02:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:31:41.330 --> 02:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative Woods
 
02:31:43.010 --> 02:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
um my thank you uh
 
02:31:45.710 --> 02:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair and again I'm going back to
 
02:31:47.929 --> 02:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
the same question
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm a I'm a patient and I come in and
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
I have no doc uh I'm just you know I
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to get uh get rid of this smoking
 
02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.490 align:start position:0%
want to get uh get rid of this smoking
problem

02:31:58.490 --> 02:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:32:00.889 --> 02:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
um do you have the standing order from
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
someone how do you proceed if I don't
 
02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
have a doctor
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
because in that case
 
02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
if you have a need for the therapy it's
 
02:32:14.270 --> 02:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
been identified as appropriate the
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
authority of flow would be just like a
 
02:32:18.889 --> 02:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
provider the pharmacist becomes another
 
02:32:20.570 --> 02:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
provider within the realm of the
 
02:32:23.090 --> 02:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
healthcare team so the Authority for
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
them to be taken care of flows through
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
the position
 
02:32:29.210 --> 02:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
um and therefore we've lowered the
 
02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
barrier for the patient to get the
 
02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:31.670 align:start position:0%
barrier for the patient to get the
therapy

02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
02:32:33.650 --> 02:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
versus making another appointment with
 
02:32:35.090 --> 02:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
somebody else so if you have a primary
 
02:32:37.010 --> 02:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
care doc you probably not go to the
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
pharmacist sometimes you would have a
 
02:32:39.889 --> 02:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
situation where if you don't have a
 
02:32:41.870 --> 02:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
primary care doc they could walk into a
 
02:32:43.130 --> 02:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
mini clinic now and see a nurse
 
02:32:45.170 --> 02:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
practitioner they could walk into an
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
urgent care center
 
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
um so basically we're trying to build
 
02:32:50.690 --> 02:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
access points for the patient to have
 
02:32:53.389 --> 02:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
the ability to see a provider who's been
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
trained appropriately like all the
 
02:32:58.190 --> 02:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
others to provide the therapy but the
 
02:33:00.889 --> 02:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
Again The Authority for it flows through
 
02:33:02.690 --> 02:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
the physician or nurse practitioner not
 
02:33:04.610 --> 02:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
independent of them
 
02:33:06.889 --> 02:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
you know but I I understand that and I
 
02:33:09.650 --> 02:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
understand the need and the Arc of the
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
changing of Medical Care uh such as we
 
02:33:14.030 --> 02:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
have hospitalists and some Physicians
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
don't go to the hospital anymore a
 
02:33:18.050 --> 02:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
variety of other changes uh but I again
 
02:33:20.210 --> 02:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
going back to my question what happens
 
02:33:22.130 --> 02:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
to the person who comes in I don't have
 
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
a doc I don't have a nurse practitioner
 
02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
how do you get the authority at that
 
02:33:29.389 --> 02:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
juncture you uh the point has been made
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
that it flows through the physician or
 
02:33:36.410 --> 02:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner so I'm I'm I guess
 
02:33:38.450 --> 02:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
I'm dense here and I'm I need some help
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
but how how does that person that comes
 
02:33:46.270 --> 02:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
in that has no contact get how does the
 
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacists get to the authority
 
02:33:51.469 --> 02:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
well I think it's two parts of the
 
02:33:53.330 --> 02:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
question one is the patient doesn't have
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
a primary care dog
 
02:33:57.710 --> 02:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
and then is sort of out there on their
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
own to some degree they don't have a
 
02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
medical home they don't have that kind
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
of uh infrastructure that they can
 
02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
advantage of what this bill does allow
 
02:34:09.650 --> 02:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
the patient to do is access
 
02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
therapy through a pharmacist now back to
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
the issue about the authority the
 
02:34:18.770 --> 02:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
pharmacist Works under the pharmacist
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
Works under Authority like
 
02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:22.429 align:start position:0%
Works under Authority like
a

02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
big pharmacy at that point in time
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
there's a position at the medical center
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
who gave me the authority
 
02:34:31.610 --> 02:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
through the standing order to treat that
 
02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:32.450 align:start position:0%
through the standing order to treat that
patient

02:34:32.450 --> 02:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
so therefore if the patient comes in
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
wants to have access to nicotine
 
02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
sensation therapy and I recognize that
 
02:34:43.070 --> 02:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
they do and they can follow within the
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines of the protocol then because
 
02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
of the authority from the position
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
within my organization I would be able
 
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
to provide it
 
02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
but it's up again it's up to the
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
position at that point in time deciding
 
02:34:56.929 --> 02:34:56.939 align:start position:0%
upon what the extent of authority they
 
02:34:58.370 --> 02:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
provide to the pharmacist because they
 
02:34:59.389 --> 02:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
control it
 
02:35:01.790 --> 02:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like working under a PA or
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
someone else so you you give them the
 
02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:04.849 align:start position:0%
someone else so you you give them the
authority

02:35:04.849 --> 02:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:35:07.849 --> 02:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
to work the patient
 
02:35:09.410 --> 02:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to see it at the state level
 
02:35:13.570 --> 02:35:13.580 align:start position:0%
so that we waited
 
02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
organization approaches it differently
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a state standard but
 
02:35:20.650 --> 02:35:20.660 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the way it was structured
 
02:35:23.150 --> 02:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative marshes texted me
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
thinking that he might be able to answer
 
02:35:28.849 --> 02:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
this question uh with other language so
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to bump him up to next
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:36.830 --> 02:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you everybody I think I'm
 
02:35:39.950 --> 02:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
unmuted I wanted to help participate in
 
02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
the discussion I hadn't originally
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak but I think I can
 
02:35:44.929 --> 02:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
answer your question uh representative
 
02:35:47.929 --> 02:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
Dr Woods the way we originally crafted
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
this language was to craft it with the
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
most flexibility possible so if you in
 
02:35:55.130 --> 02:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
your local community where you've been
 
02:35:57.290 --> 02:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
the primary care physician forever and a
 
02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
day want to take care of the members of
 
02:36:01.250 --> 02:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
your community and issue a standing
 
02:36:03.770 --> 02:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
order to your pharmacist to say that if
 
02:36:05.690 --> 02:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
people can come in they want to start
 
02:36:08.270 --> 02:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
smoking cessation therapy fine Gotta
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
Give them this counseling you can do
 
02:36:12.530 --> 02:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
this particular treatment and then they
 
02:36:14.690 --> 02:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
have to come in to see me two weeks
 
02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
later or whatever you can include all of
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
those things in your protocol as you
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
read it write it but we're controlling
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
that by the protocol so it's under the
 
02:36:25.610 --> 02:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
Physicians control and not mandating it
 
02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
by the legislature putting in particular
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
requirements so uh it's not that
 
02:36:33.290 --> 02:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant is trying to not
 
02:36:34.849 --> 02:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
answer your question it's that we
 
02:36:36.889 --> 02:36:36.899 align:start position:0%
intentionally left flexibility in the
 
02:36:42.730 --> 02:36:42.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:47.150 --> 02:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
so a pharmacist could have
 
02:36:50.389 --> 02:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
something from Dr Pearson
 
02:36:54.770 --> 02:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
saying treat any and all have fun and
 
02:36:57.469 --> 02:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
therefore the pharmacist is now got his
 
02:36:59.030 --> 02:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
standing order
 
02:37:01.550 --> 02:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
well if Dr Pearson were a licensed
 
02:37:04.910 --> 02:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
medical doctor yes that that that could
 
02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
be true yes but but uh I I think that
 
02:37:11.570 --> 02:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
since the pharmacists hold liability
 
02:37:13.250 --> 02:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
here if they don't follow things
 
02:37:17.570 --> 02:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
correctly uh they they would be uh uh
 
02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
well served and I think intentionally
 
02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
would would uh only follow standing
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
orders that they too feel comfortable
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
with so they do have to work as part of
 
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
the team and and the idea is to increase
 
02:37:31.309 --> 02:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
patient access uh and use the pharmacist
 
02:37:34.429 --> 02:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
as physician extenders so ultimately we
 
02:37:35.929 --> 02:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
can reduce the cost of health care for
 
02:37:38.330 --> 02:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire
 
02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
I actually was referring to my wife but
 
02:37:45.410 --> 02:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.570 --> 02:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:37:49.130 --> 02:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
Merchant I'm confused which is not
 
02:37:54.050 --> 02:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
unusual but
 
02:37:55.730 --> 02:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
there are two documents we're talking
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
about one is a standing order and one is
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
a protocol which is I understand it is a
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
list of questions that are asked to
 
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's appropriate for
 
02:38:07.309 --> 02:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
the person to receive this treatment I'm
 
02:38:09.889 --> 02:38:09.899 align:start position:0%
like now does one grow out of the other
 
02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
are they totally separate documents and
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:18.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:38:18.650 --> 02:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
remember that style that's a great
 
02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:21.650 align:start position:0%
remember that style that's a great
question

02:38:21.650 --> 02:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:38:23.929 --> 02:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
um there's two separate questions and
 
02:38:25.370 --> 02:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
what that question let me deal with the
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
first one the authority
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
to do something flows through the
 
02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.610 align:start position:0%
to do something flows through the
position

02:38:31.610 --> 02:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:38:35.820 --> 02:38:35.830 align:start position:0%
or through the marriage practitioner
 
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:37.389 align:start position:0%
or through the marriage practitioner
[Music]

02:38:37.389 --> 02:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
to provide products or the therapy
 
02:38:44.690 --> 02:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
patient now as far as the protocol is
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
concerned that protocol is developed
 
02:38:48.770 --> 02:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
through a joint effort with people from
 
02:38:49.969 --> 02:38:49.979 align:start position:0%
the Department health Team and services
 
02:38:52.130 --> 02:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
for the Board of Medicine in the Board
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
of Nursing so they're the ones that
 
02:38:59.210 --> 02:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
which pharmacist has to follow
 
02:39:04.730 --> 02:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
so there's two things to one is if you
 
02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
give in the authority under a provider
 
02:39:09.410 --> 02:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
to provide the therapy you have to stay
 
02:39:10.969 --> 02:39:10.979 align:start position:0%
within the guidelines of a protocol
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
based upon national standards approved
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
by the Board of Medicine the Board of
 
02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
Nursing and the Department of Public
 
02:39:18.170 --> 02:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
does that help answer the question yes
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
foreign follow-up though
 
02:39:25.610 --> 02:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up Islamic protocol been
 
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
developed or is it something you would
 
02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
develop once this bill has passed and
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
isn't that sort of putting the
 
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
before the horse I mean shouldn't we
 
02:39:36.050 --> 02:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
have this protocol available before we
 
02:39:36.060 --> 02:39:38.170 align:start position:0%
have this protocol available before we
approve

02:39:38.170 --> 02:39:38.180 align:start position:0%
approve
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
using it to qualify people to get into
 
02:39:46.429 --> 02:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:49.809 --> 02:39:49.819 align:start position:0%
the protocol is not developed
 
02:39:52.730 --> 02:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
needs to be developed
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
um we did the same thing with another
 
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
form of therapy we basically things
 
02:40:00.050 --> 02:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
change standards change kind of
 
02:40:01.370 --> 02:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
basically at that point in time we're
 
02:40:03.889 --> 02:40:03.899 align:start position:0%
leaving it to the Authority and the
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
wisdom of the Board of Medicine the
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing and the well the
 
02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:08.570 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing and the well the
department

02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:40:10.370 --> 02:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
helping Human Service for them to
 
02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
helping Human Service for them to
develop

02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
develop
 
02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:13.910 align:start position:0%
develop
article

02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
article
 
02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:18.110 align:start position:0%
article
that

02:40:18.110 --> 02:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:20.929 --> 02:40:20.939 align:start position:0%
did for that therapy Pharmacy is not
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
developed will have to be developed but
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
until the board of matter the Board of
 
02:40:26.990 --> 02:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
Nursing the important human designs off
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
on it would not become active
 
02:40:32.889 --> 02:40:32.899 align:start position:0%
one final brief follow-up Mr chairman
 
02:40:35.090 --> 02:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
02:40:37.550 --> 02:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
am I assuming then the date in this
 
02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
build coming into effect is July
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh 30th 2022 is it my assumption that
 
02:40:47.330 --> 02:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
prior to that time this protocol will be
 
02:40:57.889 --> 02:40:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:02.090 --> 02:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh could you hear me am I am I not muted
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
again no you're okay I don't know where
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant went right there
 
02:41:10.849 --> 02:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
he is I'm having a little problem like
 
02:41:14.570 --> 02:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'm having a challenge with connectivity
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping in this neck of the woods
 
02:41:18.170 --> 02:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
like representative Weber talked about
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
before uh we don't have a problem I
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
think the wires are starting to uh
 
02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:22.849 align:start position:0%
think the wires are starting to uh
wiggle

02:41:22.849 --> 02:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
wiggle
 
02:41:25.849 --> 02:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
um but I'm holding on as much as I can
 
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
um reps of style can you repeat that
 
02:41:30.889 --> 02:41:30.899 align:start position:0%
question please certainly I'm sorry uh
 
02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
yes I noticed that the date this bill
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
comes into effect is July 30th 2022.
 
02:41:40.969 --> 02:41:40.979 align:start position:0%
that's a year from this July is can I
 
02:41:42.650 --> 02:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
make the assumption that this protocol
 
02:41:45.230 --> 02:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
will be developed and in place prior to
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:59.590 --> 02:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:01.730 --> 02:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative snow yes that's the
 
02:42:03.050 --> 02:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
reason why is the delay and the
 
02:42:05.090 --> 02:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
implementation is to allow for the
 
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
protocol to be developed and quite
 
02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
frankly even if it's after January 2026
 
02:42:14.330 --> 02:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
um until that protocol is developed the
 
02:42:15.290 --> 02:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
pharmacist is going to proceed
 
02:42:18.050 --> 02:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
accordingly so it's going to require
 
02:42:19.969 --> 02:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
the consensus of the Board of Medicine
 
02:42:21.290 --> 02:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
nursing and the Department of Health
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services on that protocol before
 
02:42:25.309 --> 02:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
they can move forward regardless of the
 
02:42:25.319 --> 02:42:26.389 align:start position:0%
they can move forward regardless of the
day

02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
I read on page three line 18 the
 
02:42:32.590 --> 02:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
effective date is January 1st
 
02:42:35.570 --> 02:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
2015. that's okay your question still
 
02:42:35.580 --> 02:42:37.070 align:start position:0%
2015. that's okay your question still
holds

02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
holds
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and I believe the answer was whenever
 
02:42:42.830 --> 02:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
the date is uh it won't happen until
 
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
Protocols are in place
 
02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'm going to
 
02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
try one more Circle back and I'm going
 
02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
to hope that we do not get swept away
 
02:42:58.849 --> 02:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
again with authorities flowing from one
 
02:43:00.889 --> 02:43:00.899 align:start position:0%
person to another because I'm going to
 
02:43:04.690 --> 02:43:04.700 align:start position:0%
ask the question in the other direction
 
02:43:08.929 --> 02:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
if I walk into a pharmacy
 
02:43:13.370 --> 02:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I say to the pharmacist I desire to
 
02:43:17.690 --> 02:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
stop smoking but I do not have a primary
 
02:43:21.469 --> 02:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
care provider and I do not have a
 
02:43:24.410 --> 02:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
prescription I just want you Mr
 
02:43:26.929 --> 02:43:26.939 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to very kindly help me stop
 
02:43:29.809 --> 02:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
smoking because now is the moment
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
am I correct in thinking that unless you
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
have some kind of standing order
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
if there is no standing order that I fit
 
02:43:45.230 --> 02:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
you have to say to that patient you need
 
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
to go down to the Urgent Care Center and
 
02:43:49.870 --> 02:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
talk to a
 
02:43:53.809 --> 02:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
provider and they will then contact me
 
02:43:55.730 --> 02:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
and at that point I can help you with
 
02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
your smoking cessation is that how it
 
02:43:57.720 --> 02:43:59.809 align:start position:0%
your smoking cessation is that how it
works

02:43:59.809 --> 02:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
works
 
02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
represent Weber thank you for the
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
question exactly
 
02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you the pharmacist doesn't have
 
02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
that Authority you send them to another
 
02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:09.290 align:start position:0%
that Authority you send them to another
provider

02:44:09.290 --> 02:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:44:11.450 --> 02:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:13.429 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
Nelson

02:44:13.429 --> 02:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
Nelson
 
02:44:15.889 --> 02:44:15.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:44:19.130 --> 02:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
is the authority of the local doctor
 
02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
whatever provider is that somebody
 
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
sitting in the Walmart out in California
 
02:44:26.270 --> 02:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
doctors sitting there and big office
 
02:44:28.849 --> 02:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
saying I give you the authority to do
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
that or does it have to be somebody that
 
02:44:34.250 --> 02:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
the person sees locally
 
02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:45.590 --> 02:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:48.770 --> 02:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
under line 18.
 
02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
it has to be a licensed practitioner in
 
02:44:53.389 --> 02:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
02:44:56.570 --> 02:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
so if the provider is from California
 
02:44:58.429 --> 02:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
and does not have a license in New
 
02:45:00.050 --> 02:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they would not qualify to
 
02:45:01.969 --> 02:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
create the sending order it's limited to
 
02:45:04.010 --> 02:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
those who are licensed by the state of
 
02:45:05.809 --> 02:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire both a physician as well
 
02:45:08.570 --> 02:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
as a nurse practitioner follow up follow
 
02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:09.770 align:start position:0%
as a nurse practitioner follow up follow
up

02:45:09.770 --> 02:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:45:13.610 --> 02:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
well if Walmart hires one doctor just to
 
02:45:16.969 --> 02:45:16.979 align:start position:0%
do this in Concord New Hampshire he does
 
02:45:19.490 --> 02:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
the entire state for Walmart sits at
 
02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:20.510 align:start position:0%
the entire state for Walmart sits at
home

02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:45:23.270 --> 02:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
can he do it for any Walmart all over
 
02:45:26.690 --> 02:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
not never well could he do it for all

02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:32.330 align:start position:0%

Hampshire

02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.250 --> 02:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
you need to talk about outside of the
 
02:45:35.450 --> 02:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire within the state
 
02:45:37.010 --> 02:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire within the state of New
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they could because it's within
 
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
their organization so you got to realize
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
the physician when they sign that
 
02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
standing order takes responsibility as
 
02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
well as the pharmacist
 
02:45:49.130 --> 02:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
so it's a shared responsibility between
 
02:45:51.650 --> 02:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
the two uh The Physician does not Escape
 
02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
some liability because if they gave the
 
02:45:56.570 --> 02:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
standing order to a pharmacist that was
 
02:45:58.670 --> 02:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
a qualified and the pharmacist did
 
02:45:58.680 --> 02:45:59.450 align:start position:0%
a qualified and the pharmacist did
something

02:45:59.450 --> 02:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:46:01.309 --> 02:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the patient they would have
 
02:46:04.490 --> 02:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
the liability as well thank you
 
02:46:18.530 --> 02:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:18.540 --> 02:46:23.030 align:start position:0%

02:46:25.730 --> 02:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
if you ask Dr McKay to him on mute he
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
will get a button that he can see right
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
on his screen
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:37.969 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:46:37.969 --> 02:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:46:40.130 --> 02:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
I say I think Lucy met the dentist has
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
to ask him to unmute
 
02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
well he doesn't have to but if he does
 
02:46:46.010 --> 02:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
there will be a button on his yeah yeah
 
02:46:49.309 --> 02:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:50.690 --> 02:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I just bet we couldn't tell them
 
02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:52.250 align:start position:0%
yeah I just bet we couldn't tell them
verbally

02:46:52.250 --> 02:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
verbally
 
02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
my list is sorted by first name
 
02:46:58.250 --> 02:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
alphabetically so try Jim
 
02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
and you need to go to panelists rather
 
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you go to panelists and then gym you
 
02:47:12.110 --> 02:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
can give him a button to unmute
 
02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:23.270 align:start position:0%
can give him a button to unmute
foreign

02:47:23.270 --> 02:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.110 --> 02:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
he's under initials RJ if that helps
 
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
okay and you're unmuted Jim
 
02:47:37.990 --> 02:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me now yeah yeah okay
 
02:47:40.910 --> 02:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for that uh
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh Lucy has been great helping me but
 
02:47:47.450 --> 02:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not a good student but my interest
 
02:47:52.370 --> 02:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
is that uh having watched over time
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh the evolution of Pharmacy care
 
02:47:59.870 --> 02:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
that at the same time my impression is
 
02:48:03.050 --> 02:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
that the training of Pharmacists has
 
02:48:04.570 --> 02:48:04.580 align:start position:0%
also evolved
 
02:48:07.849 --> 02:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
particularly at the doctorate level and
 
02:48:09.650 --> 02:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
some of these questions have to do
 
02:48:12.170 --> 02:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
underlying with the competence of
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists so I wonder if the
 
02:48:16.750 --> 02:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant very briefly
 
02:48:19.309 --> 02:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
would say something about how this
 
02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
training has evolved
 
02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:25.030 align:start position:0%
training has evolved
foreign

02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:48:26.929 --> 02:48:26.939 align:start position:0%
representative McKay that's a good
 
02:48:26.939 --> 02:48:27.950 align:start position:0%
representative McKay that's a good
question

02:48:27.950 --> 02:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
did ground us um when I was first in
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
a student at Pharmacy I worked with a
 
02:48:37.010 --> 02:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
colleague who was my mentor at that time
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
who actually never graduated from
 
02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:40.130 align:start position:0%
who actually never graduated from
college

02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
college
 
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
um all you're required to do was take a
 
02:48:45.469 --> 02:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program under the hospice
 
02:48:47.389 --> 02:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
of a pharmacist at that point in time
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
and then passed the exam
 
02:48:52.250 --> 02:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
since that time it's evolved to your
 
02:48:52.260 --> 02:48:53.030 align:start position:0%
since that time it's evolved to your
point

02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:48:55.910 --> 02:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
where our pharmacist today spends four
 
02:49:00.530 --> 02:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
through either a two or four year
 
02:49:04.849 --> 02:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
undergraduate degree so the level of
 
02:49:06.530 --> 02:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
training and
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
expertise as well as the classroom
 
02:49:10.849 --> 02:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
experience that we have a lot of people
 
02:49:12.830 --> 02:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
today as pharmacists go into a one or
 
02:49:14.389 --> 02:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
two year Residency program set up a
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
hospital on top of that
 
02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
so pharmacists are well educated well
 
02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:20.170 align:start position:0%
so pharmacists are well educated well
trained

02:49:20.170 --> 02:49:20.180 align:start position:0%
trained
 
02:49:23.389 --> 02:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
today to assume some of the
 
02:49:24.650 --> 02:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we're talking about
 
02:49:26.090 --> 02:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
today and that's kind of what we're
 
02:49:29.150 --> 02:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
trying to advocate for is that we have a
 
02:49:31.490 --> 02:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
resource within our Healthcare team
 
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
that is many ways underutilized and we
 
02:49:37.250 --> 02:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
have a situation today in which we have
 
02:49:39.650 --> 02:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
a tsunami coming at us with a lot of
 
02:49:41.690 --> 02:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
people looking for health care and we
 
02:49:44.270 --> 02:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
can't meet it we have access issues that
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
we need to address so by elevating the
 
02:49:48.530 --> 02:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to allow them to do more
 
02:49:51.050 --> 02:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
things we accomplish two things one is
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
we allow the patient to get access to
 
02:49:55.309 --> 02:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
that Health Care Point number two we
 
02:49:56.809 --> 02:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
allow providers
 
02:49:59.450 --> 02:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
themselves to work at the top of their
 
02:50:01.849 --> 02:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
license so that they could take care of
 
02:50:05.210 --> 02:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
or complex patients and allow the
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacists do some of the things that
 
02:50:08.450 --> 02:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
they could do within their training they
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
have today so I do want to say thank you
 
02:50:12.050 --> 02:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
for that question per episode of McKay
 
02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
because it's important one
 
02:50:18.469 --> 02:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
I see no further hands up from the
 
02:50:21.950 --> 02:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
committee and I see no attendees with a
 
02:50:25.730 --> 02:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
hand dot indicating wishing to testify
 
02:50:25.740 --> 02:50:26.570 align:start position:0%
hand dot indicating wishing to testify
um

02:50:26.570 --> 02:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
so it looks like we're finished and when
 
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
I find my gavel we will be but don't run
 
02:50:34.490 --> 02:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
away herein's the
 
02:50:36.889 --> 02:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
um hearing on House Bill forces Mr
 
02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:39.000 align:start position:0%

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.410 align:start position:0%
chairman we had three people who signed
up

02:50:41.410 --> 02:50:41.420 align:start position:0%

uh there they are suddenly with their
 
02:50:45.710 --> 02:50:45.720 align:start position:0%

provide some examples of
 
02:51:59.330 --> 02:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists as uh part of the healthcare
 
02:52:03.889 --> 02:52:03.899 align:start position:0%

practice agreements with providers
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh and so in our Seacoast Cancer Center
 
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
I have pharmacists that work with
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
providers and and in their practice they
 
02:52:20.090 --> 02:52:20.100 align:start position:0%

with diabetes and all of these
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
pharmacists practice like a provider
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
they they have appointments the patient
 
02:52:52.130 --> 02:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
comes in they sit with the patient go
 
02:52:55.730 --> 02:52:55.740 align:start position:0%

their drug they order different drugs
 
02:53:01.849 --> 02:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
they they change Doses and uh currently
 
02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know they don't get paid for that
 
02:53:05.590 --> 02:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
that service
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
I've had other clinics requests those
 
02:53:11.929 --> 02:53:11.939 align:start position:0%
types of services such as uh
 
02:53:15.170 --> 02:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
chronic pulmonary disease pain
 
02:53:19.250 --> 02:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
management and opiate use disorders and
 
02:53:21.650 --> 02:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
again to make the business plan it's
 
02:53:23.929 --> 02:53:23.939 align:start position:0%
it's often hard to make a business plan
 
02:53:27.290 --> 02:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
which is quality metrics and freeing up
 
02:53:30.650 --> 02:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
the provider time so uh payment for our
 
02:53:35.450 --> 02:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
services would really help uh give more
 
02:53:39.230 --> 02:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
access to care and uh would improve
 
02:53:41.210 --> 02:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
quality outcomes for some of these
 
02:53:43.250 --> 02:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
patients additionally when you look at
 
02:53:45.230 --> 02:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
some of these diseases so cardiac
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
disease and cancer a number of patients
 
02:53:51.290 --> 02:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
do want to quit smoking and so it's not
 
02:53:53.870 --> 02:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
included in their CPA right now but a
 
02:53:56.330 --> 02:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
standing order with with our chief
 
02:53:59.150 --> 02:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
medical officer would allow during one
 
02:54:01.130 --> 02:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
of these appointments if a patient
 
02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
expressed that they would they're ready
 
02:54:05.469 --> 02:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
to quit that pharmacist could then
 
02:54:08.690 --> 02:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
initiate smoking cessation therapy
 
02:54:12.170 --> 02:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh additionally at Wentworth Douglas we
 
02:54:15.650 --> 02:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
have a community Retail Pharmacy so when
 
02:54:17.450 --> 02:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
you get admitted to the hospital one of
 
02:54:20.269 --> 02:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
the uh questions that is asked you know
 
02:54:22.849 --> 02:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
are you a smoker and uh are you
 
02:54:25.429 --> 02:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
interested in quitting and so that
 
02:54:26.929 --> 02:54:26.939 align:start position:0%
information again during the
 
02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
hospitalization doesn't usually get
 
02:54:32.210 --> 02:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
addressed but one of the Visions we have
 
02:54:34.849 --> 02:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
is our ambulatory or Retail Pharmacy
 
02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
would have access to that information
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
and then upon discharge they could work
 
02:54:43.250 --> 02:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
with the patient to implement smoking
 
02:54:45.410 --> 02:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
cessation and become you know their
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
source for helping them uh quit tobacco
 
02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:50.269 align:start position:0%
source for helping them uh quit tobacco
utilization

02:54:50.269 --> 02:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
utilization
 
02:54:50.279 --> 02:54:51.710 align:start position:0%
utilization
so

02:54:51.710 --> 02:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:54:54.290 --> 02:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
um any questions that you might have as
 
02:54:56.090 --> 02:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
I said I'm in favor of this I think
 
02:54:57.769 --> 02:54:57.779 align:start position:0%
pharmacists are well trained as
 
02:55:01.490 --> 02:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant said uh it's uh
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
they have a doctor of Pharmacy and most
 
02:55:05.630 --> 02:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
of my pharmacists are residency trained
 
02:55:08.570 --> 02:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
either one or two year uh post their
 
02:55:10.429 --> 02:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
pharmd program
 
02:55:19.849 --> 02:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
saying none from the committee I will
 
02:55:27.050 --> 02:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:29.170 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:55:29.170 --> 02:55:29.180 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%

pharmacists I'm
 
02:55:58.190 --> 02:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
here today to express my support of HB
 
02:56:00.889 --> 02:56:00.899 align:start position:0%
479 and it's full of increasing patient
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
access to nicotine cessation therapy
 
02:56:06.050 --> 02:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
so as you all know cigarette smoking
 
02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
Still Remains the leading cause of
 
02:56:10.670 --> 02:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
preventable disease disability and death
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
within the United States we still have
 
02:56:14.809 --> 02:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
approximately 34 million Americans who
 
02:56:17.150 --> 02:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
currently smoke cigarettes and most of
 
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
them are still smoking daily smoking
 
02:56:22.130 --> 02:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
kills over half a million Americans
 
02:56:24.050 --> 02:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
every year and millions more live with
 
02:56:25.910 --> 02:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
serious chronic diseases caused by
 
02:56:28.490 --> 02:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
smoking in addition smoking-related
 
02:56:30.349 --> 02:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
illness in the United States costs more
 
02:56:32.170 --> 02:56:32.180 align:start position:0%
than 300 billion dollars a year
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
including nearly 170 billion in direct
 
02:56:38.510 --> 02:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
medical care for adults and 156 million
 
02:56:40.730 --> 02:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
in Lost productivity
 
02:56:43.730 --> 02:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 Surgeon General report on
 
02:56:46.309 --> 02:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
smoking cessation the Surgeon General of
 
02:56:48.429 --> 02:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
the United States states the following
 
02:56:50.929 --> 02:56:50.939 align:start position:0%
clinical interventions for smoking
 
02:56:53.330 --> 02:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
cessation are critical if we are to
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
achieve our goal of eliminating the
 
02:56:56.990 --> 02:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
devastating effects of smoking on public
 
02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:58.130 align:start position:0%
devastating effects of smoking on public
health

02:56:58.130 --> 02:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:57:00.610 --> 02:57:00.620 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians nurses
 
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists and other providers and all
 
02:57:04.849 --> 02:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
medical disciplines in an all Health
 
02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
Care environments should take advantage
 
02:57:09.410 --> 02:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
of these opportunities to inform and
 
02:57:11.630 --> 02:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
encourage smokers to quit
 
02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
therapeutic assistance for smoking
 
02:57:16.010 --> 02:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
cessation includes medication treatment
 
02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
of nicotine dependence and counseling
 
02:57:19.790 --> 02:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
based upon Behavioral Science for
 
02:57:22.250 --> 02:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
psychological dependence pharmacists
 
02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
plan important role in encouraging
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
smoking cessation and are poised to
 
02:57:27.469 --> 02:57:27.479 align:start position:0%
provide this type of support
 
02:57:29.389 --> 02:57:29.399 align:start position:0%
pharmacists have a good understanding of
 
02:57:30.590 --> 02:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
the medical condition and
 
02:57:32.990 --> 02:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacotherapy to treat patients and
 
02:57:34.969 --> 02:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
are able to obtain training specific
 
02:57:37.730 --> 02:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
smoking cessation
 
02:57:40.429 --> 02:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
as Bob said currently at Wentworth
 
02:57:42.170 --> 02:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
Douglas we have three pharmacists that
 
02:57:43.610 --> 02:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
provide care to patients in the
 
02:57:45.490 --> 02:57:45.500 align:start position:0%
ambulatory settings of oncology
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
Cardiology and diabetes management all
 
02:57:50.570 --> 02:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
of these pharmacists have their dog
 
02:57:52.849 --> 02:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
shirts and Pharmacy have obtained
 
02:57:55.010 --> 02:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
Advanced Training and have advanced
 
02:57:55.020 --> 02:57:56.750 align:start position:0%
Advanced Training and have advanced
certifications

02:57:56.750 --> 02:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
certifications
 
02:57:58.910 --> 02:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration between Physicians and
 
02:58:00.530 --> 02:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
pharmacists with respect to managing
 
02:58:02.929 --> 02:58:02.939 align:start position:0%
smoking cessation therapy could achieve
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
two beneficial goals of reducing demands
 
02:58:07.610 --> 02:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
on Physicians time while increasing
 
02:58:09.650 --> 02:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
access to therapy that can help those
 
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
motivated to quit smoking succeed in
 
02:58:13.550 --> 02:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
this endeavor
 
02:58:15.590 --> 02:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
one of the factors that plays a key role
 
02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
in the underutilization of nicotine
 
02:58:20.269 --> 02:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
cessation resources is the barrier to
 
02:58:20.279 --> 02:58:21.530 align:start position:0%
cessation resources is the barrier to
accessing

02:58:21.530 --> 02:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
accessing
 
02:58:23.990 --> 02:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
a medical professional who can prescribe
 
02:58:26.030 --> 02:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
smoking cessation medications at the
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
time when a patient decides to quit AC
 
02:58:31.610 --> 02:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
479 eliminates this area by providing
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacists one of the most
 
02:58:35.450 --> 02:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
pharmacist one of the most accessible
 
02:58:37.370 --> 02:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals the ability to
 
02:58:40.610 --> 02:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
manage pharmacotherapy
 
02:58:43.190 --> 02:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration and I
 
02:58:44.690 --> 02:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
can answer any questions you might have
 
02:58:45.650 --> 02:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
of my
 
02:58:48.349 --> 02:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
before I turn anyone loose to ask a
 
02:58:50.690 --> 02:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to ask representative
 
02:58:53.090 --> 02:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
Folsom who has just joined the meeting
 
02:58:55.550 --> 02:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
to give us the essential information
 
02:58:57.650 --> 02:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
about where you are and how many people
 
02:58:59.330 --> 02:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
are there with you
 
02:59:03.769 --> 02:59:03.779 align:start position:0%
hello good morning I am at home in
 
02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
Wentworth and my husband is roaming
 
02:59:08.690 --> 02:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
around the house somewhere
 
02:59:10.910 --> 02:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm going to keep
 
02:59:13.790 --> 02:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson on his clerk until
 
02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're finished with this bill because
 
02:59:17.570 --> 02:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
he's doing a great job coming out of
 
02:59:22.130 --> 02:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
retirement thank you representative gay
 
02:59:24.170 --> 02:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:59:24.180 --> 02:59:25.550 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

02:59:25.550 --> 02:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:59:28.610 --> 02:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
um Mrs Carlton
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I just have one question and that is
 
02:59:34.370 --> 02:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
how much time with a patient do you
 
02:59:38.990 --> 02:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
envision the therapy to offer
 
02:59:42.410 --> 02:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
so our Ambulatory Care pharmacists
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
um they had like Bob said they actually
 
02:59:47.389 --> 02:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
have appointments with these patients
 
02:59:50.630 --> 02:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
and so they can piggyback on to you know
 
02:59:52.730 --> 02:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
if they're managing a patient for heart
 
02:59:56.809 --> 02:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
failure or for anticoag or for diabetes
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
um they'll spend upwards of half an hour
 
03:00:01.370 --> 03:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
an hour with these patients they can
 
03:00:03.530 --> 03:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
include nicotine cessation as part of
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
this conversation which if you're
 
03:00:07.730 --> 03:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
talking about oncology patients and lung
 
03:00:11.030 --> 03:00:11.040 align:start position:0%

diabetes management you know
 
03:00:19.370 --> 03:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
including smoking cessation and the
 
03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to treat it is vital
 
03:00:23.160 --> 03:00:24.530 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to treat it is vital
um to

03:00:24.530 --> 03:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
um to
 
03:00:27.170 --> 03:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
you know improve patient outcomes and
 
03:00:29.929 --> 03:00:29.939 align:start position:0%
improve patient access to these you know
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
critical medications
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
um they are also counseling and
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
educating the patient on how best to
 
03:00:37.910 --> 03:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
take these medications and they also
 
03:00:40.010 --> 03:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
have full access to their medication
 
03:00:40.020 --> 03:00:41.110 align:start position:0%
have full access to their medication
history

03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
history
 
03:00:45.710 --> 03:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
allergies drug interactions so that they
 
03:00:47.870 --> 03:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
can provide the appropriate care to
 
03:00:52.250 --> 03:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:55.849 --> 03:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:01.910 --> 03:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
this still seems to apply just to
 
03:01:09.110 --> 03:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid patients for your private
 
03:01:12.650 --> 03:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
patients do you get to bill for them
 
03:01:15.410 --> 03:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like y'all offer a lot
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
of time
 
03:01:17.279 --> 03:01:18.050 align:start position:0%
of time
um

03:01:18.050 --> 03:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:20.809 --> 03:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
so is this a standard thing that you can
 
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill for in other insurance
 
03:01:26.210 --> 03:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
at this point in time no because we're
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
not considered to be providers this bill
 
03:01:30.650 --> 03:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
is only going to allow us to build
 
03:01:30.660 --> 03:01:32.630 align:start position:0%
is only going to allow us to build
Medicaid

03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
03:01:34.969 --> 03:01:34.979 align:start position:0%
at this point in time however we would
 
03:01:36.830 --> 03:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
still offer these services to anybody
 
03:01:38.870 --> 03:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we see however we wouldn't receive
 
03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:40.309 align:start position:0%
that we see however we wouldn't receive
payment

03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
payment
 
03:01:43.969 --> 03:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for Miss
 
03:01:43.979 --> 03:01:47.150 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for Miss

03:01:49.790 --> 03:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none the chair recognizes Brianna
 
03:01:53.330 --> 03:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:55.130 --> 03:01:55.140 align:start position:0%

I'm here to testify in support of house
bill

03:02:04.990 --> 03:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:02:08.030 --> 03:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
479. I am a pharmacy student in my final
 
03:02:10.190 --> 03:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
year of school at the University of New
 
03:02:12.349 --> 03:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
England School of Pharmacy and I'm
 
03:02:14.809 --> 03:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
graduating with a pharmd in May
 
03:02:16.670 --> 03:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
I currently live in Hillsborough New
 
03:02:19.130 --> 03:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm a student at Wentworth
 
03:02:20.750 --> 03:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
Douglas completing clinical rotations
 
03:02:23.090 --> 03:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
right now and so I recently had the
 
03:02:24.469 --> 03:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to complete a clinical
 
03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
rotation with Dr Maureen Brady who is
 
03:02:29.450 --> 03:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
the Ambulatory Care pharmacist at the
 
03:02:32.929 --> 03:02:32.939 align:start position:0%
primary care setting who has the ability
 
03:02:36.650 --> 03:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
to treat patients with diabetes and so a
 
03:02:37.969 --> 03:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
large amount of these patients struggled
 
03:02:40.130 --> 03:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
with addiction to nicotine and numerous
 
03:02:41.990 --> 03:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
patients did express interest in wanting
 
03:02:44.269 --> 03:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
to be rid of this addiction when asked
 
03:02:46.130 --> 03:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
and so without pharmacists having the
 
03:02:48.290 --> 03:02:48.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take lead on managing
 
03:02:50.210 --> 03:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
treatment for these patients they were
 
03:02:52.010 --> 03:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
not given the attention they needed and
 
03:02:55.269 --> 03:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
many were lost to follow up as you know
 
03:02:58.010 --> 03:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
nicotine addiction does take a lot of
 
03:02:59.870 --> 03:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
time and attention and so this build
 
03:03:01.969 --> 03:03:01.979 align:start position:0%
could change that as the pharmacist did
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
have a lot of time and opportunity to
 
03:03:06.769 --> 03:03:06.779 align:start position:0%
create appointments with these patients
 
03:03:09.650 --> 03:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
and spend the time really needed to help
 
03:03:12.590 --> 03:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
them and so I saw firsthand the impact a
 
03:03:14.150 --> 03:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacists could make on the patient's
 
03:03:16.250 --> 03:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
health and quality of life when given
 
03:03:17.750 --> 03:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
the chance to manage more serious
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
conditions such as diabetes so if you
 
03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
can imagine the impact this could make
 
03:03:24.050 --> 03:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
on the serious disease of nicotine use
 
03:03:26.570 --> 03:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
disorder this bill is not meant to
 
03:03:27.889 --> 03:03:27.899 align:start position:0%
undermine the leadership of the
 
03:03:30.230 --> 03:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
patient's PCP it is merely adding
 
03:03:32.269 --> 03:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
another tool to the patient's toolkit
 
03:03:34.309 --> 03:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
and so with that I thank you for your
 
03:03:36.290 --> 03:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
time and I can answer any questions that
 
03:03:38.150 --> 03:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
03:03:40.010 --> 03:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
well as I think you know because we've
 
03:03:42.710 --> 03:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
corresponded my wife graduated from the
 
03:03:44.809 --> 03:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
University of New England with a
 
03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
doctorate and Osteopathic Medicine some
 
03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
years ago so that that prods me to ask
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
the questions since une has a pharmacy
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
school and an osteopathic medical school
 
03:03:58.429 --> 03:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
what collaboration do you
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
to do people from both schools do along
 
03:04:02.410 --> 03:04:02.420 align:start position:0%
the way
 
03:04:04.730 --> 03:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
we have many
 
03:04:07.309 --> 03:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
um many instances to collaborate not
 
03:04:09.530 --> 03:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
only with the medical students but we
 
03:04:12.370 --> 03:04:12.380 align:start position:0%
also have a school of dentistry
 
03:04:12.380 --> 03:04:14.230 align:start position:0%
also have a school of dentistry
nursing

03:04:14.230 --> 03:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
03:04:17.570 --> 03:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
and and so it's we actually fall under
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
the umbrella of the Westbrook um Health
 
03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:22.010 align:start position:0%
the umbrella of the Westbrook um Health
College

03:04:22.010 --> 03:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
College
 
03:04:24.349 --> 03:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
um College of Health Professions
 
03:04:26.570 --> 03:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
um and so we we have
 
03:04:28.969 --> 03:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
um activities that we're
 
03:04:30.830 --> 03:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
um required to complete um that are
 
03:04:33.170 --> 03:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
called ipac so it's interprofessional
 
03:04:33.180 --> 03:04:34.969 align:start position:0%
called ipac so it's interprofessional
collaboration

03:04:34.969 --> 03:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
03:04:37.130 --> 03:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
um because you know outside of school we
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
are expected to communicate with the
 
03:04:41.330 --> 03:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
rest of the healthcare team so we are
 
03:04:43.490 --> 03:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
trained fully to do that
 
03:04:46.010 --> 03:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
um many times through our school career
 
03:04:48.769 --> 03:04:48.779 align:start position:0%
and you know osteopaths love that stuff
 
03:04:48.779 --> 03:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
and you know osteopaths love that stuff
yes

03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:04:54.290 --> 03:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:56.929 --> 03:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
you have a question for soon to be d
 
03:05:01.490 --> 03:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:05.929 --> 03:05:05.939 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank you
 
03:05:10.429 --> 03:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
and I see no one from the attendees who
 
03:05:13.610 --> 03:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
has a hand up who hasn't spoken yet
 
03:05:18.230 --> 03:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
so I think we are finished on the
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
hearing and I will reprise my
 
03:05:25.010 --> 03:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh closing the hearing now let me ask
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
03:05:31.370 --> 03:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
um are you ready if we choose to exec
 
03:05:34.670 --> 03:05:34.680 align:start position:0%

03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:37.800 align:start position:0%

bill talk about Bill 479
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%

03:05:44.690 --> 03:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
exec on it
 
03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
um based upon the
 
03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and also based upon the
 
03:05:50.210 --> 03:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I do see a
 
03:05:52.730 --> 03:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
challenge though with 572 and I'll say
 
03:05:56.030 --> 03:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
challenge with 143 which I need and
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%

03:06:03.230 --> 03:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
be an extremely brief exec session on
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%

mask off but
 
04:00:49.610 --> 04:00:49.620 align:start position:0%

04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
hope so I think we should I fished
 
04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
birthday is in early August I think we
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
ought to have joy it wasn't a comment
 
04:01:28.750 --> 04:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
day and have another three day holiday
 
04:01:31.370 --> 04:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
I'll take that I've got a birthday early
 
04:01:33.170 --> 04:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
in August so that would work how about
 
04:01:35.349 --> 04:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
the Lucy
 
04:01:38.389 --> 04:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
I have done nothing anywhere near as
 
04:01:41.630 --> 04:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
important as as well you've never been a
 
04:01:44.050 --> 04:01:44.060 align:start position:0%
penis breather but
 
04:01:48.229 --> 04:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
well I was born on a holiday but he's
 
04:01:51.849 --> 04:01:51.859 align:start position:0%
not popular anymore so um
 
04:01:57.729 --> 04:01:57.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.650 --> 04:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I know I mean if you know that
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
all the whole story it's it's
 
04:02:02.399 --> 04:02:04.189 align:start position:0%
all the whole story it's it's
fascinating

04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
fascinating
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah they're speaking about speaking
 
04:02:09.849 --> 04:02:09.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the new lawsuit against the State
 
04:02:15.650 --> 04:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
against the speaker I think I would not
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:29.570 --> 04:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
Renny and seven others of us filed a
 
04:02:31.969 --> 04:02:31.979 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against the speaker in the in
 
04:02:34.729 --> 04:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
the court uh looking for remote access
 
04:02:36.769 --> 04:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
to the sessions because we've been
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
denied and I can't go and a lot of other
 
04:02:42.110 --> 04:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
Susan Rogers can't go a lot of it I'm
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely prohibited I can't join any
 
04:02:46.849 --> 04:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
meeting larger than 10 people
 
04:02:49.490 --> 04:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
because of rules that have been imposed
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
upon the place where I live
 
04:02:52.510 --> 04:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
right right
 
04:02:56.050 --> 04:02:56.060 align:start position:0%
so we need to make you your own room
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
in groups of ten can you remember that
 
04:03:02.210 --> 04:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
would be 40 different rooms we only need
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of for you
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
for you and the other fellows who need
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
it well
 
04:03:09.889 --> 04:03:09.899 align:start position:0%
you could tell that to the speaker but
 
04:03:09.899 --> 04:03:13.030 align:start position:0%
you could tell that to the speaker but
okay

04:03:13.030 --> 04:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
no I I don't think anything's going to
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
come of it to tell you the truth how big
 
04:03:20.030 --> 04:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
does the room have to be
 
04:03:22.370 --> 04:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
oh you know I don't think that's really
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
hello around here we have a huge
 
04:03:29.170 --> 04:03:29.180 align:start position:0%
uh kind of living room
 
04:03:32.269 --> 04:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
area where a lot of us meet in the
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
evening for a little uh together time
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
and they're only allowed to have 10 in
 
04:03:39.650 --> 04:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
that whole room and you have to be six
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
feet apart and wearing masks yeah and
 
04:03:44.330 --> 04:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
you know the fact of the matter is we
 
04:03:46.610 --> 04:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
don't object because up until recently
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
we've all been very safe we haven't
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
nobody in the independent living
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
apartments in this unit even though a
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
lot of the people in the nursing home
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
got it but recently we've had nine
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
people which is kind of a community
 
04:04:01.010 --> 04:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
spread thing and so they've really
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
nailed down on us now and I don't I
 
04:04:05.330 --> 04:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
don't resent it because I don't want to
 
04:04:08.090 --> 04:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
get sick again you know but
 
04:04:10.250 --> 04:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
how about putting it tent up could you
 
04:04:13.969 --> 04:04:13.979 align:start position:0%
put that in in Bedford right on the the
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
grass there set up a little tent so you
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
can do all by yourself
 
04:04:20.809 --> 04:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be good no I I often I I
 
04:04:23.090 --> 04:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
asked about that at one time is there
 
04:04:24.650 --> 04:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
any way I could be in a separate room
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
down at UNH and they said oh absolutely
 
04:04:28.969 --> 04:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
not and I said what if I stayed in my
 
04:04:28.979 --> 04:04:29.809 align:start position:0%
not and I said what if I stayed in my
car

04:04:29.809 --> 04:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
car
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
and I just got a call I can listen to
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
the going and then you call me and I'll
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
walk to the doorway and vote and they
 
04:04:40.370 --> 04:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
said no you can't do that either so but
 
04:04:43.729 --> 04:04:43.739 align:start position:0%
this isn't UNH UNH has their own very
 
04:04:46.969 --> 04:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
Persnickety rules I surely think we can
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
make you a room and there must be some
 
04:04:51.769 --> 04:04:51.779 align:start position:0%
other people who need that room too
 
04:04:53.150 --> 04:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
oh no because he would need to have
 
04:04:54.889 --> 04:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
remote access to anybody here is to be
 
04:04:56.090 --> 04:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
remote and that's what's not being
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
allowed yeah if it's remote right I'll
 
04:05:03.050 --> 04:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
tell you what I am hoping I just got my
 
04:05:05.150 --> 04:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
first shot last week and I got my second
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
shot uh March 2nd and then 14 days after
 
04:05:10.370 --> 04:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
that which is a day before Saint
 
04:05:11.769 --> 04:05:11.779 align:start position:0%
Patrick's Day
 
04:05:15.290 --> 04:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm through it now I can seek
 
04:05:17.090 --> 04:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
permission to see if I can then join in
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
in the legislature now you're feeling
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
they'll approve it but I think our
 
04:05:25.330 --> 04:05:25.340 align:start position:0%
chairman wants us yeah
 
04:05:27.769 --> 04:05:27.779 align:start position:0%
I really was enjoying this and
 
04:05:30.050 --> 04:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
particularly representative snows
 
04:05:32.530 --> 04:05:32.540 align:start position:0%
wanting to multiply three-day paid
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
weekends I just wonder if he ever worked
 
04:05:35.520 --> 04:05:36.170 align:start position:0%
weekends I just wonder if he ever worked
for

04:05:36.170 --> 04:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
um municipality or anything that would
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
give him such an idea
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
well I never actually did work for
 
04:05:45.650 --> 04:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
municipality but I I've lived in a
 
04:05:48.290 --> 04:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
number of numbers you're living in one
 
04:05:50.330 --> 04:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
now okay good uh all right we're going

also was enjoying the discussion uh
 
04:06:44.090 --> 04:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
how can she be I was just chatting away
 
04:06:53.570 --> 04:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
what can you hear me now
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
I think I'm even gonna be on video hey
 
04:06:58.670 --> 04:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
there you are Merry Christmas I was
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
saying not only are some of my favorite
 
04:07:03.530 --> 04:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
human beings on this committee but uh
 
04:07:05.210 --> 04:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
that includes some of my favorite
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
Republicans and if you think I'm talking
 
04:07:10.450 --> 04:07:10.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
so here we go this topic uh is an
 
04:07:18.889 --> 04:07:18.899 align:start position:0%
interesting one uh and I hope that the
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
discussion around these the this bill in
 
04:07:26.330 --> 04:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
this topic in some way uh becomes a
 
04:07:28.670 --> 04:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
benefit and
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
um just want to tell one quick story
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
that gets to the root of what my
 
04:07:36.050 --> 04:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
intention is with this bill I grew up in
 
04:07:39.530 --> 04:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
an area of the country where uh being
 
04:07:42.650 --> 04:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
aware of the sirens that the government
 
04:07:45.050 --> 04:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
would sound to alert us to tornado
 
04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
warnings and knowing where to get your
 
04:07:51.670 --> 04:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
news source for those tornado warnings
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh improved over time as I grew up from
 
04:07:58.370 --> 04:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
using the basic data that was available
 
04:08:00.769 --> 04:08:00.779 align:start position:0%
from the National Weather Service which
 
04:08:02.950 --> 04:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
is basically what the weather channel
 
04:08:05.809 --> 04:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
uses all of that data and made it a
 
04:08:07.610 --> 04:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
company good for them
 
04:08:07.620 --> 04:08:08.349 align:start position:0%
company good for them
um

04:08:08.349 --> 04:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:11.450 --> 04:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
to news stations fighting over who had
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
the best Doppler radar and it really
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
literally hit home bad analogy but uh
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
when my brother's neighborhood was in
 
04:08:24.110 --> 04:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
the path of a bad tornado and they of
 
04:08:27.530 --> 04:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
course sought safety and it did in fact
 
04:08:27.540 --> 04:08:28.750 align:start position:0%
course sought safety and it did in fact
level

04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:08:32.050 --> 04:08:32.060 align:start position:0%
uh most of his neighborhood and
 
04:08:35.150 --> 04:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
miraculously his house had very little
 
04:08:39.950 --> 04:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
damage uh having that ability to know
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
with the sirens and with the news
 
04:08:44.210 --> 04:08:44.220 align:start position:0%
sources and the National Weather Service
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
issuing those warnings and perfecting it
 
04:08:50.750 --> 04:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
over time has definitely saved lives so
 
04:08:53.689 --> 04:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
talking about the coveted database in
 
04:08:55.729 --> 04:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
this way and the dashboard in this way
 
04:08:58.370 --> 04:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's my intention because people are
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
making life and death decisions based on
 
04:09:03.290 --> 04:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
the data where things where the hot
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
spots are where the flare-ups are
 
04:09:11.929 --> 04:09:11.939 align:start position:0%
um it has hopefully saved some lives and
 
04:09:13.849 --> 04:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
um concerns from my constituents
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
probably from your constituents too and
 
04:09:18.769 --> 04:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
just criticisms of various aspects of
 
04:09:21.889 --> 04:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
the dashboard is what led me to want to
 
04:09:25.790 --> 04:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
do this bill to make sure that uh in no
 
04:09:28.610 --> 04:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
way shape and form is the information
 
04:09:32.090 --> 04:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
that is available uh influenced by
 
04:09:34.849 --> 04:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
political decisions to make sure that it
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
is non-partisan unbiased and impartial
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
as impartial as the Doppler radar is uh
 
04:09:45.469 --> 04:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
I also though want to say for just a
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
moment what I'm not criticize it as the
 
04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
spouse of a software engineer who worked
 
04:09:54.290 --> 04:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Information
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
Services and admin Services who also
 
04:10:01.490 --> 04:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
handled State data I am not criticizing
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
the staff who are doing their jobs and
 
04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
doing what their bot with their boss
 
04:10:11.809 --> 04:10:11.819 align:start position:0%
orders them to do in no way shape or
 
04:10:15.110 --> 04:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
form I believe for sure that those were
 
04:10:18.769 --> 04:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
workers are doing their best to help
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
inform the public and affect safety
 
04:10:26.090 --> 04:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
um maybe my criticism is of the
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner of HHS possibly the
 
04:10:32.689 --> 04:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
governor and concerns that my
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
constituents have had about in
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
discrepancies in data regarding school
 
04:10:40.809 --> 04:10:40.819 align:start position:0%
systems that what is on the dashboard
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
often didn't match what was being
 
04:10:46.729 --> 04:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
reported uh from their home communities
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
through uh local information sources uh
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
that there hasn't been until more
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
recently enough uh
 
04:11:00.710 --> 04:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
sunlight placed on other areas the way
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
that the school system had its own
 
04:11:06.889 --> 04:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
segment of the data the dashboard we
 
04:11:10.090 --> 04:11:10.100 align:start position:0%
should have always had as well uh
 
04:11:13.490 --> 04:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
sunshine on how is this affecting
 
04:11:16.370 --> 04:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
minority communities because we've seen
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
in other places where the data has risen
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh more or where the cases were um
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
more more cases of covid were happening
 
04:11:30.830 --> 04:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
more quickly and more severely than New
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that early data was indicating
 
04:11:36.769 --> 04:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
that the the number of deaths and
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations among African-Americans
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
and Latinos were much higher and while
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
technically we have a smaller population
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
than many to Most states uh any
 
04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
um way shape or form that it would
 
04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
affect our 10 percent of our population
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
that are people of color would
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
definitely should be mindful of that I
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
have also I'm sure we will hear from
 
04:12:06.830 --> 04:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
staff at HHS who've done a thorough job
 
04:12:11.210 --> 04:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
of raising their um points regarding
 
04:12:14.570 --> 04:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
that data I I think that's again I don't
 
04:12:17.090 --> 04:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
criticize them at all I think that that
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
is good information that will be helpful
 
04:12:21.110 --> 04:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
to make this build better
 
04:12:22.849 --> 04:12:22.859 align:start position:0%
um and really
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure how we get to
 
04:12:30.050 --> 04:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
um other than reporters questions and
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
things I've heard from my constituents
 
04:12:34.490 --> 04:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
how can we make this non-partisan
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
unbiased and impartial and I've made an
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
attempt to do that with this film so let
 
04:12:42.889 --> 04:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
me go through a couple of the details on
 
04:12:45.170 --> 04:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
04:12:48.050 --> 04:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
so as I try to figure out where I had it
 
04:12:48.060 --> 04:12:49.250 align:start position:0%
so as I try to figure out where I had it
open

04:12:49.250 --> 04:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
open
 
04:12:51.290 --> 04:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
04:12:54.650 --> 04:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
um so in the first section it's just
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
because uh there is no official I don't
 
04:13:00.670 --> 04:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
believe statute requiring any sort of
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
coveted dashboard in the first place uh
 
04:13:07.010 --> 04:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
I realize that has been voluntary on the
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
executive Branch's uh decision making
 
04:13:10.729 --> 04:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
and I'm grateful I'm sure we're all
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
grateful for that
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
um if we could find a way to uh codify
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
this for the future and not just have
 
04:13:21.050 --> 04:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
section one is specifically about
 
04:13:25.070 --> 04:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
covid-19 if you perhaps as a committee
 
04:13:27.110 --> 04:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
would like to make this something that
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
any pandemic would produce I think
 
04:13:34.010 --> 04:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
that's also a good idea but for now this
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
obviously the text is just about the
 
04:13:40.610 --> 04:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
code 19. uh included UNH I thought that
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
might be a way to ensure that the nature
 
04:13:47.570 --> 04:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
of the dashboard can be non-partial
 
04:13:47.580 --> 04:13:49.250 align:start position:0%
of the dashboard can be non-partial
impartial

04:13:49.250 --> 04:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
impartial
 
04:13:53.150 --> 04:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh include lots more demographics not
 
04:13:55.130 --> 04:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
all of these need to be released to the
 
04:13:57.889 --> 04:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
Press necessarily or to the public where
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
it would
 
04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I definitely would want to
 
04:14:03.490 --> 04:14:03.500 align:start position:0%
be mindful of
 
04:14:07.610 --> 04:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh not just HIPAA laws but uh privacy in
 
04:14:11.809 --> 04:14:11.819 align:start position:0%
general but at the Town level have uh
 
04:14:14.330 --> 04:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
the amount of data I've listed in here
 
04:14:18.650 --> 04:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
is age race town and eligibility
 
04:14:21.130 --> 04:14:21.140 align:start position:0%
um and also that vaccine information
 
04:14:24.410 --> 04:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
could be cross-referenced uh by
 
04:14:27.110 --> 04:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
geography age race and eligibility I'm
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
not sure if anything you or the governor
 
04:14:31.969 --> 04:14:31.979 align:start position:0%
have done thus far already addresses the
 
04:14:34.130 --> 04:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
vaccination issue but when I wrote this
 
04:14:38.050 --> 04:14:38.060 align:start position:0%
bill there I wasn't aware yet of how far
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
that information was being made public
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
other than what I saw in the press
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
conferences which were at that point
 
04:14:45.000 --> 04:14:46.790 align:start position:0%
conferences which were at that point
inadequate

04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
04:14:49.130 --> 04:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
um that has improved by necessity to
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
some degree but there still are
 
04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
questions about vaccinations and where
 
04:14:55.130 --> 04:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
is that where where is the flow going
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
well and not going well I think that
 
04:15:00.910 --> 04:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
also is important for the public to know
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
so folks in any areas that have
 
04:15:03.840 --> 04:15:05.809 align:start position:0%
so folks in any areas that have
difficulties

04:15:05.809 --> 04:15:05.819 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
04:15:08.570 --> 04:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
um that shining a light on it being
 
04:15:11.050 --> 04:15:11.060 align:start position:0%
transparent about it can help everyone
 
04:15:14.990 --> 04:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
maneuver the system and improve it
 
04:15:17.450 --> 04:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and I also include really for the
 
04:15:19.729 --> 04:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
purpose of is of since we've gone
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
through uh not quite a year of covid in
 
04:15:25.809 --> 04:15:25.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but maybe close to that
 
04:15:29.330 --> 04:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
a legislative committee since the
 
04:15:31.010 --> 04:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
majority of coveted decisions have
 
04:15:34.490 --> 04:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
happened under executive order and uh
 
04:15:36.610 --> 04:15:36.620 align:start position:0%
you know conferring with the state
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists the governor and his
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
staff and the commissioner of HHS and
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
her staff I thought it might be a good
 
04:15:47.750 --> 04:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
idea to include a legislative committee
 
04:15:52.370 --> 04:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
you know not ignoring gopher but to do a
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
review of this information this could
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
become something that would review uh
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
how have we done under covid but really
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
with the at least the way it's written
 
04:16:05.330 --> 04:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
now looking at underrepresented
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
populations in the pandemic and then uh
 
04:16:12.290 --> 04:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
more details about that committee I know
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
study committees are not really
 
04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
happening right now I will also admit I
 
04:16:20.090 --> 04:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
am not an expert
 
04:16:22.250 --> 04:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
um this just comes out of concerns I've
 
04:16:25.610 --> 04:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
heard uh from the media press conference
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
is here from news stories from Florida
 
04:16:31.849 --> 04:16:31.859 align:start position:0%
and New York and just from conversations
 
04:16:34.370 --> 04:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
between lawmakers and the general public
 
04:16:37.790 --> 04:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
my constituents included that there have
 
04:16:40.130 --> 04:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
been times that the New Hampshire
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
coveted database
 
04:16:46.849 --> 04:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh for lack of a better term has felt
 
04:16:46.859 --> 04:16:47.769 align:start position:0%
uh for lack of a better term has felt
um

04:16:47.769 --> 04:16:47.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
opportunistic no that's the wrong word
 
04:16:53.090 --> 04:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
has seemed to have been influenced
 
04:16:55.370 --> 04:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
potentially by politics or political
 
04:16:57.969 --> 04:16:57.979 align:start position:0%
decisions I don't have any proof of that
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
this is just going and when data seemed
 
04:17:03.650 --> 04:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
to be flowing more freely versus when it
 
04:17:06.830 --> 04:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't uh somewhat in proximity to an
 
04:17:06.840 --> 04:17:07.630 align:start position:0%
wasn't uh somewhat in proximity to an
election

04:17:07.630 --> 04:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not raising specific allegations
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
other than I heard concerns about that
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I did see there were times that the
 
04:17:16.849 --> 04:17:16.859 align:start position:0%
data lagged and it just so happened to
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
be near an election I am not saying for
 
04:17:22.309 --> 04:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
sure that someone did anything wrong but
 
04:17:24.729 --> 04:17:24.739 align:start position:0%
I do know the system as it exists today
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
for all of the good intentions of the
 
04:17:30.110 --> 04:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
staff implementing the dashboard which
 
04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
again I'm grateful for are no doubt
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
above board but by including the
 
04:17:39.110 --> 04:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
legislation or the legislature and some
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
oversight that we can look at the kova
 
04:17:45.309 --> 04:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
database in future pandemic
 
04:17:48.110 --> 04:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
dashboards in the same manner that we do
 
04:17:50.349 --> 04:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
the Doppler radar that's my purpose
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
other folks that are speaking uh are
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
much better at the details and are
 
04:17:59.990 --> 04:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
better experts than me I just hope that
 
04:18:01.729 --> 04:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
this conversation and hopefully this
 
04:18:04.370 --> 04:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
bill creates the scenario where to
 
04:18:06.889 --> 04:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
whatever degree we as a legislature can
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
improve this process for the health and
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
well-being of our citizens
 
04:18:14.809 --> 04:18:14.819 align:start position:0%
that we can do that and on that note I
 
04:18:16.250 --> 04:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
will take questions
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:32.570 --> 04:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh have we lost representative Pearson
 
04:18:33.889 --> 04:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
I've been trying to make sure we
 
04:18:35.570 --> 04:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
actually had a host here
 
04:18:38.830 --> 04:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
looks like he's muted
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
which is why I am so understanding with
 
04:18:44.990 --> 04:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
all of you my colleagues representative
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
McKay would you please unmute so we can
 
04:18:51.290 --> 04:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
hear your question to the representative
 
04:18:52.969 --> 04:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
thank you very much am I coming through
 
04:18:55.010 --> 04:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
you're doing great better than I did
 
04:18:58.250 --> 04:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you during the break I've went out
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
and came back in again so straightened
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
out that little problem but my uh Chris
 
04:19:06.590 --> 04:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think this is a
 
04:19:12.110 --> 04:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
a thoughtful committee I'm not sure it
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
sounds as if this committee does not
 
04:19:19.130 --> 04:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
gather data but it reviews data that
 
04:19:21.110 --> 04:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
exists in Corrections Health and Human
 
04:19:25.490 --> 04:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
Services and what I don't know is how
 
04:19:28.010 --> 04:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
are you going to use that data and who
 
04:19:33.650 --> 04:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:36.769 --> 04:19:36.779 align:start position:0%
um well this data would be hopefully
 
04:19:39.889 --> 04:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
used to improve the dashboard as it
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
continues to exist in the short term
 
04:19:46.130 --> 04:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh I do think there's again a value to
 
04:19:48.769 --> 04:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
looking at this information
 
04:19:48.779 --> 04:19:50.269 align:start position:0%
looking at this information
and

04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:52.130 --> 04:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
um questions that maybe weren't
 
04:19:54.650 --> 04:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
completely answered by the media and by
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
our cons you know some concerns that our
 
04:19:58.849 --> 04:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
constituents have had about the
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
discrepancies between what numbers seem
 
04:20:03.170 --> 04:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
to be reported in local communities on
 
04:20:05.450 --> 04:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
even just schools versus what was
 
04:20:08.330 --> 04:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
showing up on the kova dashboard I think
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
it would also be helpful to have a
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
review of some sort
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
which is what in part the intention was
 
04:20:17.450 --> 04:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
by creating a committee
 
04:20:22.030 --> 04:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
partially but do you like a follow-up
 
04:20:28.910 --> 04:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
sir would you like to follow up uh no I
 
04:20:30.410 --> 04:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
think I'd like to listen to All Those
 
04:20:33.290 --> 04:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
Questions okay thank you representative
 
04:20:33.300 --> 04:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
Questions okay thank you representative
Weber

04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
04:20:37.490 --> 04:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:20:39.600 --> 04:20:40.790 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:45.290 --> 04:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how you are thinking about
 
04:20:47.809 --> 04:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issue that unlike
 
04:20:50.809 --> 04:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
tornadoes we have
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
um conflicting interests here one being
 
04:20:56.530 --> 04:20:56.540 align:start position:0%
the very real necessity for
 
04:20:59.570 --> 04:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
sunlight and data and and information
 
04:21:04.250 --> 04:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
that people can use to make important
 
04:21:06.170 --> 04:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves and their loved
 
04:21:09.290 --> 04:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
ones but on the other side we have the
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
issue of privacy for many of our sisters
 
04:21:15.410 --> 04:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
citizens and
 
04:21:18.290 --> 04:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
um if if we're looking at a system that
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
can be cross-referenced uh via age race
 
04:21:25.610 --> 04:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
and geographic location I'm thinking
 
04:21:28.729 --> 04:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
about living in a small town and the
 
04:21:31.010 --> 04:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
number of African Americans in my small
 
04:21:35.030 --> 04:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
town is very small and I could find out
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
an uncomfortable amount about their
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
health uh if I can cross-reference
 
04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
according to all of these factors so
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
um my concern
 
04:21:49.929 --> 04:21:49.939 align:start position:0%
is how do you envision
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
resolving those two issues the one of
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
privacy versus the access to data
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and I'll be
 
04:22:00.050 --> 04:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
honest with you that it
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
um maybe because I'm from Concord it
 
04:22:04.729 --> 04:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
didn't occur to me but as you ask that
 
04:22:07.370 --> 04:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
that is obviously a concern I know I
 
04:22:09.530 --> 04:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
used to go to a retreat center in
 
04:22:11.410 --> 04:22:11.420 align:start position:0%
Springfield that would bring in
 
04:22:14.210 --> 04:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
African-American Retreat leaders and I
 
04:22:16.370 --> 04:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
realized from the population that
 
04:22:19.250 --> 04:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
Springfield had two African Americans
 
04:22:22.309 --> 04:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
based from the last census in 2010 and
 
04:22:24.290 --> 04:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
we would more than double the population
 
04:22:27.050 --> 04:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
of African Americans in that town so I
 
04:22:28.969 --> 04:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
apologize that I didn't it didn't dawn
 
04:22:32.750 --> 04:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
on me sooner uh it would probably be a
 
04:22:35.530 --> 04:22:35.540 align:start position:0%
great idea then to regionalize certain
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
rural areas based on
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
um perhaps well you guys probably have a
 
04:22:42.530 --> 04:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
better idea of how regionalization
 
04:22:44.990 --> 04:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
already occurs in various Health Care
 
04:22:48.050 --> 04:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
populations I know whether it's from the
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis to just which hospitals
 
04:22:53.210 --> 04:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
serve which communities
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm not the best person to draw those
 
04:22:57.170 --> 04:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
boundaries but I would would be more
 
04:23:00.650 --> 04:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
than happy to research that and make a
 
04:23:02.689 --> 04:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
determination to regionalize that to
 
04:23:05.570 --> 04:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
some level but I'll admit that didn't
 
04:23:07.370 --> 04:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
occur to me until you asked the question
 
04:23:09.290 --> 04:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
and I apologize because it's a great
 
04:23:09.300 --> 04:23:10.670 align:start position:0%
and I apologize because it's a great
point

04:23:10.670 --> 04:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:15.410 --> 04:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
and representative Shapiro on mute and
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
how about it thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:23:21.410 --> 04:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schultz
 
04:23:21.420 --> 04:23:22.250 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schultz
um

04:23:22.250 --> 04:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that the
 
04:23:29.330 --> 04:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
kova dashboard currently is set up and
 
04:23:29.340 --> 04:23:30.650 align:start position:0%
kova dashboard currently is set up and
run

04:23:30.650 --> 04:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
run
 
04:23:30.660 --> 04:23:31.309 align:start position:0%
run
um

04:23:31.309 --> 04:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:33.530 --> 04:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
by health and human services without the
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
help of the University system is that
 
04:23:38.450 --> 04:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
correct it's my understanding that the
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
university plays some level of a role
 
04:23:42.769 --> 04:23:42.779 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest that I don't know the
 
04:23:42.779 --> 04:23:44.689 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest that I don't know the
details

04:23:44.689 --> 04:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
details
 
04:23:46.729 --> 04:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
um actually I think a member of your
 
04:23:48.830 --> 04:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
committee might be able to answer that I
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
might be wrong on that
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
um but uh that was my attempt to make
 
04:23:58.450 --> 04:23:58.460 align:start position:0%
sure that those working on the database
 
04:24:03.769 --> 04:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
uh had a level of impartiality that
 
04:24:03.779 --> 04:24:05.210 align:start position:0%
uh had a level of impartiality that
um

04:24:05.210 --> 04:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
could possibly exist with this with the
 
04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
university system uh to be impartial
 
04:24:13.380 --> 04:24:14.990 align:start position:0%
university system uh to be impartial
uh

04:24:14.990 --> 04:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:16.849 --> 04:24:16.859 align:start position:0%
anyway basically repeating things I've
 
04:24:19.250 --> 04:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
already said but it's my understanding
 
04:24:23.330 --> 04:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
that UNH uh plays a role already if I'm
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
wrong on that I apologize
 
04:24:26.880 --> 04:24:28.010 align:start position:0%
wrong on that I apologize
um

04:24:28.010 --> 04:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:30.170 --> 04:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm gonna go back to the way
 
04:24:33.050 --> 04:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
it's worded in here representative you
 
04:24:35.929 --> 04:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
may be interested to know that Trisha
 
04:24:39.849 --> 04:24:39.859 align:start position:0%
Tilley from DHHS is next up to speak
 
04:24:42.530 --> 04:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
she may be able to address a number of
 
04:24:44.769 --> 04:24:44.779 align:start position:0%
those things
 
04:24:47.389 --> 04:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
outlining a number of things I found
 
04:24:49.370 --> 04:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
very helpful and I wish I had connected
 
04:24:51.530 --> 04:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
with her when I was writing the Bill
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
so that's a good point follow-up uh
 
04:24:57.290 --> 04:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
follow up yes okay I will wait for that
 
04:25:00.769 --> 04:25:00.779 align:start position:0%
information from the next speaker
 
04:25:00.779 --> 04:25:02.269 align:start position:0%
information from the next speaker
um

04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:04.490 --> 04:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
I I have a question about the committee
 
04:25:07.070 --> 04:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
which is while I really like the fact
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
that it's very
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
well maybe very is not the right word
 
04:25:14.330 --> 04:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
but it's narrow in that it's it's
 
04:25:16.490 --> 04:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
supposed to address
 
04:25:16.500 --> 04:25:17.389 align:start position:0%
supposed to address
um

04:25:17.389 --> 04:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:20.750 --> 04:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
disparities in care and treatment during
 
04:25:20.760 --> 04:25:22.130 align:start position:0%
disparities in care and treatment during
the

04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:25:24.290 --> 04:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
um covid pandemic
 
04:25:26.929 --> 04:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good thing do you know
 
04:25:29.710 --> 04:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
if there are is or are going to be
 
04:25:33.110 --> 04:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
committees or commissions that
 
04:25:36.650 --> 04:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
have a more overarching
 
04:25:36.660 --> 04:25:37.429 align:start position:0%
have a more overarching
um

04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:39.649 --> 04:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
effort to just evaluate our whole
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
response to the pandemic
 
04:25:43.790 --> 04:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that question
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
I will be honest that when the bill was
 
04:25:49.309 --> 04:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
being drafted and I started working on
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
it in October and November this was a
 
04:25:53.149 --> 04:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
concern that was being raised by
 
04:25:56.929 --> 04:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
minority Health Advocates and because of
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to include it I believe
 
04:26:03.290 --> 04:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
that the executive branch has now some
 
04:26:05.889 --> 04:26:05.899 align:start position:0%
time ago now addressed
 
04:26:09.530 --> 04:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
and released data on some aspects of
 
04:26:09.540 --> 04:26:10.570 align:start position:0%
and released data on some aspects of
this

04:26:10.570 --> 04:26:10.580 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:26:13.429 --> 04:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
if I could rewrite the bill today which
 
04:26:15.170 --> 04:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
we can amend it and I'm very open to
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
amendments I would maybe rework this to
 
04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
be to include that as a
 
04:26:26.809 --> 04:26:26.819 align:start position:0%
item of study as well as a review of
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
what what worked well and what didn't go
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
well with our data dashboard and where
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
were we able to successfully keep folks
 
04:26:38.929 --> 04:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
safe and make good decisions for their
 
04:26:41.450 --> 04:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
communities or schools or businesses and
 
04:26:43.490 --> 04:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
what what can be improved for the next
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic representative Schultz when I
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
introduced a bill to a committee uh
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago I had the good liberal
 
04:26:54.290 --> 04:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
arts broad 50 000 feet up in the year
 
04:26:56.570 --> 04:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
top down looking approach which is sort
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
of my world view anyway and I suggested
 
04:27:02.750 --> 04:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
to the chair that since the person from
 
04:27:05.210 --> 04:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
one of the Departments knew way more
 
04:27:07.610 --> 04:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
about the details than I did could I
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
turn my time over to that person and
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
then perhaps come back for a little few
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
minutes at the end and that was allowed
 
04:27:18.649 --> 04:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
would you would you be uh comfortable if
 
04:27:21.889 --> 04:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
I asked Tricia Tilley to speak next As
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
Long As I give you a lasted bat I am
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
always uh very eager to say when I don't
 
04:27:31.250 --> 04:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
know something so please I would love to
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
hear from her go for it thank you thank
 
04:27:36.290 --> 04:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
you for your cooperation and could we
 
04:27:40.370 --> 04:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:42.889 --> 04:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
04:27:45.170 --> 04:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
04:27:47.269 --> 04:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
is Patricia Tilley and I am the deputy
 
04:27:48.530 --> 04:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
director of the division of Public
 
04:27:51.070 --> 04:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
Health Services here in New Hampshire
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS so the department truly appreciates
 
04:27:56.570 --> 04:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
the concerns the sponsor brings forward
 
04:27:58.729 --> 04:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
and and I think what I would like to do
 
04:28:01.130 --> 04:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
today is seek to provide some additional
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
information about our dashboard and the
 
04:28:05.389 --> 04:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
efforts that we've had to address the
 
04:28:07.790 --> 04:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
health disparities to supplement any of
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
the additional testimony that you're
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
going to hear today Above All We Share
 
04:28:14.830 --> 04:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
the common goals of data transparency
 
04:28:17.689 --> 04:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
sunshine and and most importantly the
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
Improvement of Health outcomes for all
 
04:28:21.610 --> 04:28:21.620 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters and we agree
 
04:28:24.110 --> 04:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly that the data is
 
04:28:25.969 --> 04:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
critically important so let's talk about
 
04:28:29.570 --> 04:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
the dashboard so DHHS has had a covid-19
 
04:28:31.610 --> 04:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
dashboard available to the public for
 
04:28:34.130 --> 04:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
much of this pandemic it's updated daily
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
and is actively used by the public and
 
04:28:39.649 --> 04:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
the media the bill is in alignment with
 
04:28:42.170 --> 04:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
much of our current practice with some
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
notable exceptions so first there's a
 
04:28:46.309 --> 04:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
reference as we've just been talking
 
04:28:48.530 --> 04:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
about to the university system of New
 
04:28:51.410 --> 04:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the university system is
 
04:28:54.170 --> 04:28:54.180 align:start position:0%
currently provides us with timely data
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
and they are a great partner but the
 
04:28:59.630 --> 04:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
website itself is not necessarily a
 
04:29:02.269 --> 04:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
collaboration UNH is developing their
 
04:29:05.389 --> 04:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
own dashboards and we link to them from
 
04:29:07.130 --> 04:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
the schools dashboard to gather
 
04:29:10.130 --> 04:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
information that we provide but we
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
partner with an existing vendor to
 
04:29:14.929 --> 04:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
actually do the development of the
 
04:29:17.570 --> 04:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
dashboards and ultimately the dashboard
 
04:29:20.689 --> 04:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
is managed solely by the Department of
 
04:29:22.670 --> 04:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
04:29:25.130 --> 04:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
to some of the other points in the bill
 
04:29:28.130 --> 04:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
we have not created specialized tabs for
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes prisons congregate living
 
04:29:33.530 --> 04:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
but we do have a number of ways right
 
04:29:36.050 --> 04:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
now that individuals can track long-term
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
care facilities
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
and it is possible that we could
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
consider how we could provide other data
 
04:29:43.969 --> 04:29:43.979 align:start position:0%
that in ways that are useful to the
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
public while protecting privacy I think
 
04:29:49.849 --> 04:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
that's the that is the balance that we
 
04:29:51.950 --> 04:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
have had throughout this entire pandemic
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
of being transparent and protecting
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
privacy at the same time
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
and you know to the point around vaccine
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
data we I think we all understand the
 
04:30:04.250 --> 04:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
value of tracking that data to ensure
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
that our vaccines are delivered fairly
 
04:30:09.710 --> 04:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
and equitably and currently we provide
 
04:30:11.929 --> 04:30:11.939 align:start position:0%
information on Fridays as part of our
 
04:30:15.170 --> 04:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
daily DHHS updates some of the important
 
04:30:17.210 --> 04:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
demographic information that the bill
 
04:30:19.370 --> 04:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
describes such as race and ethnicity
 
04:30:22.490 --> 04:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
however is unlike is likely to be
 
04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
incomplete right now in part because of
 
04:30:28.610 --> 04:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
the CDC vam system we use doesn't make
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
that a required field
 
04:30:33.170 --> 04:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
the committee has likely seen that on
 
04:30:35.570 --> 04:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
our covid-19 interactive Equity
 
04:30:38.510 --> 04:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
dashboard that has been available since
 
04:30:40.610 --> 04:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
we launched our interactive dashboard
 
04:30:42.889 --> 04:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
and even prior to that one we just had a
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
static piece of data on the site we
 
04:30:48.110 --> 04:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
always had some information about race
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
and ethnicity inequity but on these tabs
 
04:30:53.210 --> 04:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
right now on the interactive Equity
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
dashboard tab you can see that race and
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
ethnicity is only available right now
 
04:31:01.370 --> 04:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
for about 61 percent of cases and we've
 
04:31:03.290 --> 04:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
been actively working with those that
 
04:31:06.410 --> 04:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
submit specimens for testing to us to
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
improve that rate it takes a village to
 
04:31:11.389 --> 04:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
create the data that you see here it
 
04:31:13.729 --> 04:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
takes information from the people who
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
submit the data to make sure that that
 
04:31:17.630 --> 04:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
is clear and accurate it takes the work
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
that we have within our department and
 
04:31:21.410 --> 04:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
within our vendors to then turn that
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
around and make sure that it is it's
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
this it it provides the sunshine that I
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
think we all are interested in
 
04:31:31.370 --> 04:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
and to representative Weber's Earth
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
Point early on we are very focused on
 
04:31:37.070 --> 04:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
how to protect privacy so that there can
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
be no constructive identification
 
04:31:43.849 --> 04:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
especially by wraith or ethnicity as you
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
get down to those smaller geographical
 
04:31:46.560 --> 04:31:47.929 align:start position:0%
get down to those smaller geographical
regions

04:31:47.929 --> 04:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
regions
 
04:31:50.269 --> 04:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic we have used the
 
04:31:52.849 --> 04:31:52.859 align:start position:0%
data that is available to us to build a
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
dynamic and responsive dashboard that
 
04:31:57.410 --> 04:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of state agencies
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
Community organizations and the public
 
04:32:05.210 --> 04:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
creating a specific statute may run the
 
04:32:07.610 --> 04:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
risk of pigeonholing our limited
 
04:32:10.130 --> 04:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
resources and it may require elements
 
04:32:12.290 --> 04:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
that were currently unable to share
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
again thinking about things like privacy
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
there may be other ways however that we
 
04:32:19.910 --> 04:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
can continue to evolve what is presented
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
so that it paints a more comprehensive
 
04:32:22.560 --> 04:32:23.330 align:start position:0%
so that it paints a more comprehensive
picture

04:32:23.330 --> 04:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
picture
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to note that Dave
 
04:32:26.450 --> 04:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
Wieters who is our director of
 
04:32:28.370 --> 04:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
Information Services is also available
 
04:32:30.170 --> 04:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
to answer any of your technical
 
04:32:32.030 --> 04:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions about the functionality of the
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
covet dashboard
 
04:32:36.889 --> 04:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
but let me just sum up by thinking about
 
04:32:38.929 --> 04:32:38.939 align:start position:0%
the equity and health disparities
 
04:32:41.090 --> 04:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
legislative committee that is suggested
 
04:32:43.849 --> 04:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
and I think we have similar common goals
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
and concerns in this area for
 
04:32:49.610 --> 04:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
redirecting time and energy from other
 
04:32:53.689 --> 04:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
similar ongoing efforts to begin I just
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
want to say that we know that Health
 
04:32:57.889 --> 04:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
Equity means that everyone has a fair
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
and just opportunity to be as healthy as
 
04:33:03.889 --> 04:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
possible covid has put a spotlight on
 
04:33:05.631 --> 04:33:05.641 align:start position:0%
communities that have not been equitably
 
04:33:07.730 --> 04:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
served by our health care and our Public
 
04:33:09.769 --> 04:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
Health Systems in the past and the
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
existing cracks in the foundation have
 
04:33:15.289 --> 04:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
really only widened DHHS has used our
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
data and the lived experience of our
 
04:33:20.570 --> 04:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
partners to focus on Health Equity and
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
the disproportionate impact of covid-19
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
within certain New Hampshire communities
 
04:33:27.949 --> 04:33:27.959 align:start position:0%
this work has occurred not only within
 
04:33:30.170 --> 04:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
our covid response team but throughout
 
04:33:32.209 --> 04:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
the entire department ensuring that we
 
04:33:34.609 --> 04:33:34.619 align:start position:0%
can better serve both the health and the
 
04:33:36.170 --> 04:33:36.180 align:start position:0%
social service needs of all New
 
04:33:37.730 --> 04:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents
 
04:33:40.369 --> 04:33:40.379 align:start position:0%
DHHS has provided leadership to the
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
governor's covid-19 Equity response team
 
04:33:45.170 --> 04:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
and is actively beginning to implement
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
many of the strategies within the
 
04:33:48.970 --> 04:33:48.980 align:start position:0%
governor's covid-19
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
initial report and recommendations there
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
that Equity Response Team report and
 
04:33:54.600 --> 04:33:55.730 align:start position:0%
that Equity Response Team report and
recommendations

04:33:55.730 --> 04:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
04:33:58.010 --> 04:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
we target specific Outreach for testing
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
and vaccine for black and latinx
 
04:34:02.330 --> 04:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
communities including our new Americans
 
04:34:04.131 --> 04:34:04.141 align:start position:0%
that live right here in Concord or in
 
04:34:06.890 --> 04:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
Manchester in Nashua we're committed to
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
a 10 allocation for vaccine for
 
04:34:11.090 --> 04:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacted populations
 
04:34:15.170 --> 04:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
as identified by Community Partners and
 
04:34:19.490 --> 04:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
through a a database called the covid-19
 
04:34:22.910 --> 04:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
community vulnerability index
 
04:34:24.769 --> 04:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections has been a
 
04:34:26.631 --> 04:34:26.641 align:start position:0%
strong partner and our team has worked
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
closely with counties to investigate and
 
04:34:31.609 --> 04:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
mitigate Transmission in county jails
 
04:34:33.529 --> 04:34:33.539 align:start position:0%
and nursing homes
 
04:34:36.349 --> 04:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
so with regard to both the dashboard and
 
04:34:38.929 --> 04:34:38.939 align:start position:0%
Equity strategies we hope that any
 
04:34:41.631 --> 04:34:41.641 align:start position:0%
legislative efforts would support and
 
04:34:44.090 --> 04:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
Not Duplicate or redirect the
 
04:34:46.010 --> 04:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
Department's current focus on data
 
04:34:48.650 --> 04:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
transparency and our focus on health
 
04:34:48.660 --> 04:34:49.849 align:start position:0%
transparency and our focus on health
disparities

04:34:49.849 --> 04:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
disparities
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS is very open to suggestions and
 
04:34:55.849 --> 04:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
feedback for improvement the dashboard
 
04:34:57.410 --> 04:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
and all of our work has been an
 
04:34:59.631 --> 04:34:59.641 align:start position:0%
iterative process that has evolved over
 
04:35:02.330 --> 04:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
time but it's unclear right now if
 
04:35:04.010 --> 04:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
codifying the requirements of the
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
dashboard and statute would actually
 
04:35:08.209 --> 04:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
give us the needed flexibility to be
 
04:35:11.631 --> 04:35:11.641 align:start position:0%
responsive as the pandemic evolves
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
a new legislative committee may not be
 
04:35:16.730 --> 04:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily duplicative of existing work
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
but it may have limits on the lived
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
experience and the diversity of the
 
04:35:23.869 --> 04:35:23.879 align:start position:0%
makeup you know of that group it might
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
be more impactful to create a more
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
permanent version of the equity response
 
04:35:30.650 --> 04:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
team so that broader voices can maybe
 
04:35:33.650 --> 04:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
engaged to improve safety and reduce
 
04:35:36.349 --> 04:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
disparities so I think I'll wrap up by
 
04:35:37.849 --> 04:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
saying we look forward to working
 
04:35:39.890 --> 04:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
together to achieve the common goals
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we all share right now and I'm
 
04:35:44.449 --> 04:35:44.459 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions or to
 
04:35:47.209 --> 04:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
defer to my friend David Wieters who is
 
04:35:49.250 --> 04:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
far more the technical expert than I am
 
04:35:51.289 --> 04:35:51.299 align:start position:0%
so thank you chair
 
04:35:52.369 --> 04:35:52.379 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:35:55.310 --> 04:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh Miss Tilly uh

representative soloway
 
04:36:00.051 --> 04:36:00.061 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman can you hear me
 
04:36:03.650 --> 04:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
we can uh thank you so much I'd like to
 
04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
direct your question to representative
 
04:36:08.029 --> 04:36:08.039 align:start position:0%
Schultz representative Schultz thank you
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
so much for your efforts uh in this
 
04:36:09.959 --> 04:36:11.209 align:start position:0%
so much for your efforts uh in this
regard

04:36:11.209 --> 04:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
regard
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
um just to let you folks know that uh I
 
04:36:16.369 --> 04:36:16.379 align:start position:0%
and other members of this committee sit
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
on the governor's task force on covid
 
04:36:22.131 --> 04:36:22.141 align:start position:0%
and reopening we hear from Ms Tilly at
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
every one of our meetings we go over the
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
dashboard at every one of our meetings
 
04:36:28.189 --> 04:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm very familiar with how that
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
dashboard operates and it's a genuine uh
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
value uh to those of us who are trying
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
to make decisions
 
04:36:40.910 --> 04:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
um I I wonder representative Schultz if
 
04:36:45.051 --> 04:36:45.061 align:start position:0%
we look at that dashboard not as a
 
04:36:49.849 --> 04:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
single event but as one of many events
 
04:36:51.890 --> 04:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
in which the state is attempting to
 
04:36:54.189 --> 04:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
Grapple with
 
04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
epidemiologic issues
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
would you consider uh rewriting your
 
04:37:00.240 --> 04:37:02.269 align:start position:0%
would you consider uh rewriting your
legislation

04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:37:08.209 --> 04:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
um to create either a commission on
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
information flow out of DHHS and the way
 
04:37:15.349 --> 04:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
it is packaged or would you consider
 
04:37:18.529 --> 04:37:18.539 align:start position:0%
remanding this to the uh oversight
 
04:37:21.529 --> 04:37:21.539 align:start position:0%
committee on a DHHS I think there's
 
04:37:24.189 --> 04:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
somebody you can speak to that committee
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
and ask the chairman of that committee
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
to create a subcommittee on information
 
04:37:31.849 --> 04:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
flow out of DHHS
 
04:37:33.470 --> 04:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:37:35.330 --> 04:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz
 
04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
I would I would be interested in doing
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
that yes just to follow up on what he
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
requested the chairman of that group to
 
04:37:45.650 --> 04:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
do I would be happy to do that I'm sorry
 
04:37:47.631 --> 04:37:47.641 align:start position:0%
I walked on you representative Schultz
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
here you go Mr chair that is your
 
04:37:52.510 --> 04:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
prerogative wow
 
04:37:58.070 --> 04:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you to your first point yes I
 
04:38:00.051 --> 04:38:00.061 align:start position:0%
think I know enough to answer yes to
 
04:38:02.810 --> 04:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
that to your second point I don't know
 
04:38:06.349 --> 04:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
nearly as much about that as you do
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
um now that I know your level of
 
04:38:12.170 --> 04:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
expertise I wish I had worked with you
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
from the beginning I just didn't know
 
04:38:18.410 --> 04:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
um mm-hmm I'm glad legislators are
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
involved in this process because it
 
04:38:23.810 --> 04:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.051 --> 04:38:27.061 align:start position:0%
I'm open to amending this uh any way the
 
04:38:30.890 --> 04:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.890 --> 04:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
uh let me jump in again as the chair and
 
04:38:36.410 --> 04:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
say that since all of our work has to be
 
04:38:40.010 --> 04:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
done by March 11th and what you raise
 
04:38:43.551 --> 04:38:43.561 align:start position:0%
are very very good points but require a
 
04:38:46.250 --> 04:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
lot of comparison to what is being done
 
04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%
what could be done and so on would it be
 
04:38:52.910 --> 04:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
helpful and this is your call that you
 
04:38:56.810 --> 04:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
recommend to us to hold on to this bill
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
and retain it and work on it over the
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
summer and the fall so that what comes
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
out would be very much to everyone's
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
Advantage would that work for you
 
04:39:11.090 --> 04:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
otherwise this has got to get done no
 
04:39:13.609 --> 04:39:13.619 align:start position:0%
later than March 11th
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
I I do know representative Muse was
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
going to speak I'd hoped he was going to
 
04:39:20.631 --> 04:39:20.641 align:start position:0%
be a co-sponsor of this I'd like to hear
 
04:39:23.570 --> 04:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
what he says about that as well uh I
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer at this moment I
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
need to think about it good just
 
04:39:28.970 --> 04:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
floating the idea representative Marsh
 
04:39:32.209 --> 04:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak thank you Mr
 
04:39:34.730 --> 04:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh uh thank you
 
04:39:36.410 --> 04:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this bill to
 
04:39:38.208 --> 04:39:38.218 align:start position:0%
our attention my my question is mostly
 
04:39:40.490 --> 04:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
to Patricia Tilley because I too agree
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
that that we need to be concerned about
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
health care disparities but uh uh I
 
04:39:48.288 --> 04:39:48.298 align:start position:0%
Patricia Tilley and I uh and
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Canuck all serve on the
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
State Health assessment State Health
 
04:39:54.170 --> 04:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan Council and it is my
 
04:39:56.330 --> 04:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
understanding that that Council has
 
04:39:58.490 --> 04:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
significant resources to address Health
 
04:40:01.368 --> 04:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
Care disparities and uh are you of the
 
04:40:03.050 --> 04:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
opinion that that section of this bill
 
04:40:05.448 --> 04:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
at least could perhaps be addressed
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
better in that ongoing Forum than in a
 
04:40:10.730 --> 04:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
smaller Committee just for a single
 
04:40:10.740 --> 04:40:12.830 align:start position:0%
smaller Committee just for a single
purpose

04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:40:14.690 --> 04:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Marsh for that
 
04:40:16.490 --> 04:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
for that question thank you and again
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
our work at the State Health assessment
 
04:40:20.690 --> 04:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
and State Health Improvement plan was
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
affectionately known as Shaw ship
 
04:40:26.930 --> 04:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
um to your point absolutely uh has it at
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
its heart to address those disparities
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
um specifically we have not focused on
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
covid related disparities
 
04:40:38.570 --> 04:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
um within Shaw ship but it is certainly
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
something that is within the context of
 
04:40:44.930 --> 04:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
that group to look at and to consider
 
04:40:46.850 --> 04:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
um to my earlier point I think there are
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
a number of different groups that are
 
04:40:52.430 --> 04:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
all interested in better understanding
 
04:40:54.410 --> 04:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
um both what the health outcomes were as
 
04:40:57.288 --> 04:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
a result of the pandemic and um and how
 
04:40:59.330 --> 04:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
that might affect us moving forward as
 
04:41:01.010 --> 04:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
we think about other
 
04:41:04.190 --> 04:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
emergencies that might might come in the
 
04:41:04.200 --> 04:41:05.510 align:start position:0%
emergencies that might might come in the
future

04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:41:07.730 --> 04:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
I I thank you for that and I thank you
 
04:41:09.288 --> 04:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
for all the improvements that you have
 
04:41:11.570 --> 04:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
made to the dashboard over the time that
 
04:41:13.130 --> 04:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative soloway and I have been
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
serving on the reopening uh task force
 
04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
and the various briefings that you've
 
04:41:18.550 --> 04:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
given us I think that you've given us
 
04:41:20.930 --> 04:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
increasingly more data as time goes by
 
04:41:23.330 --> 04:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
and I truly appreciate that
 
04:41:25.910 --> 04:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you sir the chair recognizes
 
04:41:30.890 --> 04:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.128 --> 04:41:34.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and um
 
04:41:37.970 --> 04:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Tilly and actually and even
 
04:41:37.980 --> 04:41:40.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Tilly and actually and even
um

04:41:40.010 --> 04:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh Christine
 
04:41:44.330 --> 04:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
um my question has to do with
 
04:41:48.050 --> 04:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
um how to how do we identify the sources
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
of information to be provided for the
 
04:41:53.570 --> 04:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
dashboard I sit on a Somersworth school
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
board and we've been trying to build our
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
plan to bring students back to school
 
04:42:01.970 --> 04:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
and some of our members have acquired
 
04:42:04.250 --> 04:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
information from other towns and even
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
from Somersworth and when they take a
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
look at the the dashboard associated
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
with the school system
 
04:42:10.798 --> 04:42:11.448 align:start position:0%
with the school system
um

04:42:11.448 --> 04:42:11.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:14.448 --> 04:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to be up to date with
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
the information that's needed even
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
Somersworth data was not up to date so
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
do we have a regular source of
 
04:42:22.850 --> 04:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
information in each of the towns and
 
04:42:25.810 --> 04:42:25.820 align:start position:0%
cities to provide this information
 
04:42:27.830 --> 04:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:42:29.868 --> 04:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
Cannon you're asking a really important
 
04:42:29.878 --> 04:42:30.948 align:start position:0%
Cannon you're asking a really important
question

04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:42:33.170 --> 04:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
um and the answer is it's very complex
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
and there are multiple sources of data
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
um that fill each of the different
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
components of um those tabs that we see
 
04:42:42.410 --> 04:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
right now on the interactive dashboard
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start off and talk a little
 
04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
bit specifically around school and then
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
I will also defer
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
um to David Wieters who's the director
 
04:42:52.730 --> 04:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
of our information Services who will
 
04:42:54.770 --> 04:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
clean up any inaccuracies that I might
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
have I'm not the technical expert in
 
04:42:59.628 --> 04:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
this space but let me start off by
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
simply saying in schools one of the
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
things that we are um I'll actually even
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
back up even further so one of the
 
04:43:08.930 --> 04:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
things people might want to know is so
 
04:43:11.570 --> 04:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
how do we know what's the data source
 
04:43:13.730 --> 04:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
for the number of cases that we have
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
well that comes directly from the data
 
04:43:19.610 --> 04:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
that we have from testing so it is a
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
requirement in the communicable disease
 
04:43:26.090 --> 04:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
statutes that positive test for covid-19
 
04:43:28.368 --> 04:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
are reported to the Department of Health
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
and Human Services so we receive all of
 
04:43:32.830 --> 04:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
those positive
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
positive cases and that's what's
 
04:43:36.410 --> 04:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
reported to us and that essentially
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
gives us that information about the
 
04:43:42.050 --> 04:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
number of cases that we have and in that
 
04:43:44.690 --> 04:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
there is further information so it will
 
04:43:46.610 --> 04:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
give us the location of that person
 
04:43:49.610 --> 04:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
their Town their residence and some
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
other demographic information to my
 
04:43:53.810 --> 04:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
point earlier about even race and
 
04:43:55.730 --> 04:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
ethnicity race and ethnicity is a
 
04:43:58.368 --> 04:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
required aspect of that data and yet we
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
all know especially in the volume of
 
04:44:02.208 --> 04:44:02.218 align:start position:0%
work that we've had right now sometimes
 
04:44:04.250 --> 04:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
things are incomplete when we receive it
 
04:44:07.010 --> 04:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
in and so I will often use the example
 
04:44:09.770 --> 04:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
even about towns where people
 
04:44:12.590 --> 04:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
um a town may even be incomplete as many
 
04:44:15.470 --> 04:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
of us live in rural areas our mailing
 
04:44:17.750 --> 04:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
address may not actually be our town of
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
residence and so that's an area where we
 
04:44:22.128 --> 04:44:22.138 align:start position:0%
sometimes have some discrepancies
 
04:44:24.050 --> 04:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
um and with further investigation we can
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
clean that up with the high volume of
 
04:44:28.490 --> 04:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
cases we've had sometimes that
 
04:44:30.650 --> 04:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
information we don't get to that quite
 
04:44:32.448 --> 04:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
in the timely way that we would hope to
 
04:44:35.090 --> 04:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
as we could possibly as we did back in
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
the summer when we had far fewer cases
 
04:44:40.430 --> 04:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
for schools in particular this is where
 
04:44:42.350 --> 04:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
it gets a little bit trickier because we
 
04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
also need to know whether that child was
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
in person attending school at that time
 
04:44:52.250 --> 04:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
so it no if my child is fully remote and
 
04:44:55.610 --> 04:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
is not attending school in person but is
 
04:44:58.850 --> 04:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
only attending school remotely they may
 
04:45:00.890 --> 04:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
not show up in that school dashboard
 
04:45:03.410 --> 04:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
because they were not actually putting
 
04:45:05.868 --> 04:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
any other people in that school at risk
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
because they were home fully remote at
 
04:45:11.208 --> 04:45:11.218 align:start position:0%
that time I'm going to pause and hand it
 
04:45:13.970 --> 04:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
over to David Wieters and to for him to
 
04:45:16.730 --> 04:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
provide any additional information that
 
04:45:18.050 --> 04:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
I might have left out
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
well the chair would have to recognize
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
him for that to happen and the chair
 
04:45:25.850 --> 04:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
indeed does that we recognize that we
 
04:45:36.250 --> 04:45:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my name is David
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
Wieters I'm the information Services
 
04:45:43.730 --> 04:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
director for DHHS and I appreciate the
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
this legislature thank you chair for
 
04:45:50.448 --> 04:45:50.458 align:start position:0%
recognizing me
 
04:45:52.490 --> 04:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
so I don't really have additional
 
04:45:55.010 --> 04:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
information other than we are working so
 
04:45:56.650 --> 04:45:56.660 align:start position:0%
one of the common
 
04:45:59.448 --> 04:45:59.458 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've heard regarding the
 
04:46:01.448 --> 04:46:01.458 align:start position:0%
school's dashboard specifically is
 
04:46:03.708 --> 04:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
understanding the the school Community
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
versus the covid community transmission
 
04:46:09.410 --> 04:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
potential at the school and there are
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
two different perspectives so I have a
 
04:46:13.730 --> 04:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
student that goes to a school a school
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
in this in this wonderful State and he
 
04:46:19.730 --> 04:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
is a fully remote student if he
 
04:46:22.368 --> 04:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
were to come down with covid he would
 
04:46:25.430 --> 04:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
not be shown up on the covid
 
04:46:25.440 --> 04:46:26.590 align:start position:0%
not be shown up on the covid
transmission

04:46:26.590 --> 04:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
04:46:29.330 --> 04:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
schools dashboard however you would see
 
04:46:31.610 --> 04:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
him in the community dashboard as a
 
04:46:33.250 --> 04:46:33.260 align:start position:0%
potential Community transmission
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
perspective and so you still would see
 
04:46:37.070 --> 04:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
him there
 
04:46:39.470 --> 04:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
but understanding the perspective as a
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
parent I was looking to see well he is
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
still a student at the school so how
 
04:46:46.510 --> 04:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
does he impact that student population
 
04:46:50.570 --> 04:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a community member of that
 
04:46:50.580 --> 04:46:51.530 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a community member of that
school

04:46:51.530 --> 04:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:46:54.470 --> 04:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
so we are looking at expanding that
 
04:46:58.250 --> 04:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
dashboard to show Active cases of of a
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
person that we are that is known to be
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
attending a school but then is fully
 
04:47:03.240 --> 04:47:04.250 align:start position:0%
attending a school but then is fully
remote

04:47:04.250 --> 04:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
remote
 
04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
so that you would still see the com the
 
04:47:09.230 --> 04:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
population as the student population or
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
the the edu the the school population it
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
could be educator or administrative
 
04:47:17.690 --> 04:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
staff but don't but for our purposes of
 
04:47:19.128 --> 04:47:19.138 align:start position:0%
understanding Community transmission
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
within the school you would have that
 
04:47:25.490 --> 04:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
alternate filter to say who is attending
 
04:47:27.770 --> 04:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
or actually physically on site at a
 
04:47:30.288 --> 04:47:30.298 align:start position:0%
school that could put my student or
 
04:47:33.050 --> 04:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
educator at risk of getting covet so
 
04:47:34.368 --> 04:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
there are two different perspectives so
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
we we certainly acknowledge the
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
perspective of wanting to see that my my
 
04:47:43.550 --> 04:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
child is one of many students at at the
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
kirschard school district and how does
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
he reckon how is he recognized amongst
 
04:47:51.890 --> 04:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
that so we continuously my purpose of
 
04:47:54.050 --> 04:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
this testimony is to say we get that
 
04:47:56.510 --> 04:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
feedback and we continuously evolve our
 
04:47:58.850 --> 04:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
dashboards to meet those needs and we
 
04:48:00.288 --> 04:48:00.298 align:start position:0%
are working hand in hand with the
 
04:48:02.810 --> 04:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
superintendents within the schools as
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
well as the nurses to continue to convey
 
04:48:08.510 --> 04:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
that information and evolve it
 
04:48:10.610 --> 04:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps clarify the school
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
specific but
 
04:48:14.208 --> 04:48:14.218 align:start position:0%
if you have any other questions I'm here
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
to answer as possible that helps a bit
 
04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:22.128 --> 04:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative snow
 
04:48:24.288 --> 04:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
on mute yourself and address your
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
question to one of the now three people
 
04:48:30.410 --> 04:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
I think my question was already answered
 
04:48:32.448 --> 04:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:48:37.490 --> 04:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.530 --> 04:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I have a couple
 
04:48:42.530 --> 04:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
of questions if I may uh I think the
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
first one is for Ms Tilly or it just
 
04:48:47.930 --> 04:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
arises out of her testimony I'm
 
04:48:51.170 --> 04:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
wondering as as one who wrestled
 
04:48:53.208 --> 04:48:53.218 align:start position:0%
mightily with Vamps both on my own
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
behalf and on behalf of quite a number
 
04:49:00.170 --> 04:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
of other people over over time how it is
 
04:49:03.708 --> 04:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
possible that vams only captures 61
 
04:49:07.490 --> 04:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
percent of ethnicity when you cannot get
 
04:49:10.750 --> 04:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
the website to move unless you
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately enter an ethnicity
 
04:49:18.830 --> 04:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and it's unclear
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
even to those of us who have a great
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
deal of of book learning at least that
 
04:49:26.330 --> 04:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
you had to not only highlight your
 
04:49:30.050 --> 04:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
ethnicity you had to move it via not
 
04:49:32.930 --> 04:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
arrows but little tiny teeny tiny carrot
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
signs over to a blank box in order to
 
04:49:39.410 --> 04:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
advance the
 
04:49:42.410 --> 04:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
um program at all so how is it possible
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
that only 61 percent of people are
 
04:49:47.930 --> 04:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
showing up
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
as identifying with one ethnicity or
 
04:49:50.760 --> 04:49:52.550 align:start position:0%
as identifying with one ethnicity or
another

04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:49:55.250 --> 04:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber so I
 
04:49:57.948 --> 04:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
think I was unclear in my testimony that
 
04:50:01.610 --> 04:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
61 is actually in reference to the data
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
that we show right now on our Equity
 
04:50:05.810 --> 04:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
dashboard which is around Active cases
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
so in that case it is the data that we
 
04:50:11.810 --> 04:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
receive from those who order the testing
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
or put forward that data through us that
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
it may not be fully complete so that's
 
04:50:19.550 --> 04:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
where that 61 number comes from so I I
 
04:50:21.890 --> 04:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
apologize for not being clear about that
 
04:50:25.250 --> 04:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
in my testimony regarding vams and again
 
04:50:27.530 --> 04:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
if with the chair's permission
 
04:50:29.330 --> 04:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
um uh David Wieters can speak a little
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
bit more in detail about the ways in
 
04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
which that data may come through and and
 
04:50:37.490 --> 04:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
I agree it was a complex task to do that
 
04:50:40.970 --> 04:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
sort of moving over of the race and
 
04:50:40.980 --> 04:50:43.070 align:start position:0%
sort of moving over of the race and
ethnicity

04:50:43.070 --> 04:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
ethnicity
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
very easy as soon as you knew how may I
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up Mr chair yes you may
 
04:50:50.330 --> 04:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
um it's it's actually it's a whole new
 
04:50:52.190 --> 04:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
question but you may have a whole new
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
04:50:54.000 --> 04:50:56.530 align:start position:0%
question thank you
um

04:50:56.530 --> 04:50:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:59.448 --> 04:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
my question I'm not sure which one of
 
04:51:04.190 --> 04:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
these it's from for is I notice that we
 
04:51:07.610 --> 04:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
report data regularly
 
04:51:11.448 --> 04:51:11.458 align:start position:0%
um on towns and when we get down to one
 
04:51:15.288 --> 04:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
to four we under five we say one to four
 
04:51:18.650 --> 04:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to highlight too
 
04:51:21.170 --> 04:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
specifically who may or may not be in
 
04:51:22.910 --> 04:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
the spotlight in a particular Town
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
particularly small towns and it it it is
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
a mystery to me that we can why is it
 
04:51:35.930 --> 04:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
that we can report data on the town of
 
04:51:40.128 --> 04:51:40.138 align:start position:0%
Roxbury population 229
 
04:51:43.128 --> 04:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
in the aggregate of course uh when we
 
04:51:47.570 --> 04:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
cannot and we cannot report data in the
 
04:51:51.770 --> 04:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
aggregate on the 424 public servants who
 
04:51:57.770 --> 04:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:00.170 --> 04:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I'm I'm sort of
 
04:52:02.270 --> 04:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
processing how I I can answer that right
 
04:52:06.410 --> 04:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
now I you know I can speak to the town
 
04:52:09.590 --> 04:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and again we are working closely on
 
04:52:12.110 --> 04:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
constructive identification and you're
 
04:52:14.930 --> 04:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
correct we have we have a process by
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
which we do not respond we do not
 
04:52:19.310 --> 04:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
provide detailed information you know
 
04:52:21.650 --> 04:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
when the number is below five
 
04:52:23.628 --> 04:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
um for lots of reasons one that may be
 
04:52:25.850 --> 04:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
an unstable number but really in this
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
case it is more likely so that you
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
cannot do that constructive
 
04:52:28.798 --> 04:52:31.190 align:start position:0%
cannot do that constructive
identification

04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
identification
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
um in general
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
um we do not provide
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
um you know clustered info information
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
about particular clusters unless there
 
04:52:45.708 --> 04:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
is a risk to the public so that is why I
 
04:52:47.810 --> 04:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
I think I'll just end my statement there
 
04:52:50.510 --> 04:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
and we can follow up um offline for
 
04:52:52.128 --> 04:52:52.138 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
04:52:54.708 --> 04:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
04:52:57.770 --> 04:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'm all set good anyone else in the
 
04:52:59.448 --> 04:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
committee for the
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.830 --> 04:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none I call Representative David
 
04:53:06.840 --> 04:53:08.150 align:start position:0%
seeing none I call Representative David
Muse

04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
Muse
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.410 --> 04:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:53:15.420 --> 04:53:16.670 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
committee

04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:53:17.930 --> 04:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm going to commit this a little bit
 
04:53:20.930 --> 04:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
different than the way we've heard this
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
comment uh up until this point part of
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
my professional background is I'm a
 
04:53:27.470 --> 04:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
former partner in the customer
 
04:53:30.288 --> 04:53:30.298 align:start position:0%
experience practice of aeon Hewitt and
 
04:53:32.030 --> 04:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I've had
 
04:53:33.650 --> 04:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
experience with over the years is
 
04:53:36.530 --> 04:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
actually creating dashboards and
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
applications that sit on top of a
 
04:53:42.110 --> 04:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
complex database systems
 
04:53:42.120 --> 04:53:43.190 align:start position:0%
complex database systems
and

04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:45.410 --> 04:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
one of the things I think that's really
 
04:53:48.170 --> 04:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
important to keep in mind is that
 
04:53:48.180 --> 04:53:48.948 align:start position:0%
important to keep in mind is that
um

04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
my personal expertise uh does not have
 
04:53:54.050 --> 04:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
to do with public health I think you
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
have members of the committee who have
 
04:53:58.970 --> 04:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh a huge amount of experience in that
 
04:54:01.810 --> 04:54:01.820 align:start position:0%
area that that is is not my thing
 
04:54:05.448 --> 04:54:05.458 align:start position:0%
but what I'm trained to do is I'm re I'm
 
04:54:09.230 --> 04:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
trained to recognize an expert system
 
04:54:13.490 --> 04:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
um that's posing as public information
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and so so what I mean by that is that
 
04:54:17.040 --> 04:54:17.628 align:start position:0%
um and so so what I mean by that is that
um

04:54:17.628 --> 04:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:19.970 --> 04:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
the tendency of people who are experts
 
04:54:22.730 --> 04:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
in any field is to create informational
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
resources that are useful to them uh and
 
04:54:28.010 --> 04:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
to other people in their field
 
04:54:30.050 --> 04:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I think has
 
04:54:33.050 --> 04:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
been left behind in this process uh has
 
04:54:35.330 --> 04:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
been the fact that there are also School
 
04:54:38.208 --> 04:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
administrators uh teachers parents
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
citizens uh everyday people who are
 
04:54:43.070 --> 04:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about this information who are
 
04:54:46.190 --> 04:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to this uh to this dashboard and
 
04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
these other resources and really trying
 
04:54:51.170 --> 04:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
to get answers to simple questions uh
 
04:54:53.690 --> 04:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
one that I get all the time is how many
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
Active cases are there in Portsmouth
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so I actually can't get an answer to
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
that question on the dashboard what I
 
04:55:04.730 --> 04:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
have to do is I have to go over I have
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
to kind of look underneath the graphic
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire on the
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
DHHS covet website and tucked in
 
04:55:13.010 --> 04:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
underneath there are two links one to a
 
04:55:15.470 --> 04:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
PDF file that has a map of the state and
 
04:55:17.208 --> 04:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
all the communities with a number of
 
04:55:19.550 --> 04:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
active cases listed beside it the other
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
is an Excel file
 
04:55:24.890 --> 04:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I I think I'm the only person in my
 
04:55:26.810 --> 04:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
community who's managed to find that so
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
far uh because I keep getting asked for
 
04:55:32.510 --> 04:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
it over and over and over again and what
 
04:55:35.390 --> 04:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
that points out is the fact that
 
04:55:38.090 --> 04:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
we have one of the problems that we have
 
04:55:40.970 --> 04:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the resources on this site
 
04:55:43.850 --> 04:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
um is a fair amount of fragmentation
 
04:55:46.910 --> 04:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
so while there are critical resources
 
04:55:48.830 --> 04:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
that are aggregated on what we call the
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
dashboard there's a lot of other
 
04:55:53.330 --> 04:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
important information that's not
 
04:55:55.430 --> 04:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
included on the dashboard and so things
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
like cases and communities are one good
 
04:56:00.410 --> 04:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
example and something that's actually
 
04:56:02.690 --> 04:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
from from the purpose of a tools
 
04:56:02.700 --> 04:56:03.708 align:start position:0%
from from the purpose of a tools
dashboard

04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
dashboard
 
04:56:05.030 --> 04:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
um you know you would think would be
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
very important too
 
04:56:09.830 --> 04:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
um another area where I'll Echo
 
04:56:13.190 --> 04:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz's observation is
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
it can be very frustrating seeing an
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
article in the newspaper that talks
 
04:56:21.470 --> 04:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
about active covet cases in a school in
 
04:56:23.390 --> 04:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
your District as a state representative
 
04:56:26.750 --> 04:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
and that those cases appear on the
 
04:56:29.590 --> 04:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
dashboard for four or five days
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes for until four or five days
 
04:56:31.920 --> 04:56:33.650 align:start position:0%
sometimes for until four or five days
later

04:56:33.650 --> 04:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:56:35.510 --> 04:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and I understand that there are all
 
04:56:37.128 --> 04:56:37.138 align:start position:0%
kinds of reasons why that's happening
 
04:56:39.970 --> 04:56:39.980 align:start position:0%
but the whole idea of having a dashboard
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
is to uh enable people to make what the
 
04:56:46.490 --> 04:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
governor calls data-driven decisions uh
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
and when the data is not up to date uh
 
04:56:51.050 --> 04:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
when it doesn't represent the true
 
04:56:53.930 --> 04:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
status of things like Community spread
 
04:56:56.090 --> 04:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
in a community then there's a question
 
04:56:58.730 --> 04:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
about how useful it actually is and and
 
04:57:01.128 --> 04:57:01.138 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example in the schools
 
04:57:03.110 --> 04:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
dashboard in particular
 
04:57:05.690 --> 04:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
um on above the middle of January uh
 
04:57:07.610 --> 04:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
there were days for the city of
 
04:57:09.948 --> 04:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester when that when the dashboard
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
was showing no Active cases at all in
 
04:57:16.128 --> 04:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
the Manchester school system however we
 
04:57:18.530 --> 04:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
were getting information that there were
 
04:57:21.288 --> 04:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
a ton of Active cases among children 18
 
04:57:24.288 --> 04:57:24.298 align:start position:0%
and under in the city of Manchester
 
04:57:26.990 --> 04:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
so the dashboard the dashboard if you
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
were if you were to go solely from from
 
04:57:30.170 --> 04:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
the dashboard and you were looking at
 
04:57:31.730 --> 04:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
the number of cases that are accounted
 
04:57:33.650 --> 04:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
for in the schools you would get the
 
04:57:35.690 --> 04:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
impression that covet has ceased to
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
exist in the Manchester school system
 
04:57:39.890 --> 04:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
when the reality is is that as soon as
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
we start sending kids back to school
 
04:57:43.970 --> 04:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to have cases and and that's
 
04:57:46.010 --> 04:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
exactly what's happened not only in
 
04:57:47.330 --> 04:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester but in a bunch of other
 
04:57:50.948 --> 04:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
communities so one question is is this
 
04:57:53.868 --> 04:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
data-driven dashboard really giving us
 
04:57:56.750 --> 04:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
the information that we need in order to
 
04:57:59.868 --> 04:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
be able to make decisions like this
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
another area where I'll kind of echo
 
04:58:05.230 --> 04:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
what representative Schultz has said is
 
04:58:07.610 --> 04:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
the information around vaccinations
 
04:58:10.190 --> 04:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
right now is a huge gap
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
um once a week There's a vaccine
 
04:58:15.490 --> 04:58:15.500 align:start position:0%
allocation summary that gets appended to
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
dhhs's daily summary
 
04:58:20.690 --> 04:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
um and and essentially it's it's one of
 
04:58:22.250 --> 04:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
the most cryptic things you'll ever see
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that there are members of the
 
04:58:25.730 --> 04:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
committee who can look at it and tell
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
you exactly how to read it and exactly
 
04:58:29.690 --> 04:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
what it is but when I look at it as a
 
04:58:32.990 --> 04:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
citizen I'm wondering so how many people
 
04:58:34.550 --> 04:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire have actually gotten
 
04:58:36.830 --> 04:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
the first dose you know what percentage
 
04:58:38.030 --> 04:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
of people have been completely
 
04:58:38.040 --> 04:58:39.470 align:start position:0%
of people have been completely
vaccinated

04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
how much vaccine that the state has
 
04:58:44.690 --> 04:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
received has actually been put into arms
 
04:58:47.208 --> 04:58:47.218 align:start position:0%
you know is it like half of it is it
 
04:58:49.128 --> 04:58:49.138 align:start position:0%
three quarters of it is it almost all of
 
04:58:51.830 --> 04:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
it you know and it's very very very
 
04:58:54.708 --> 04:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
difficult to tell that from the
 
04:58:57.230 --> 04:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
resources that that we have and there's
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
also no information on vaccine equity
 
04:59:02.990 --> 04:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
so the governor has decided that it's
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
important enough to reserve 10 of the
 
04:59:09.890 --> 04:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
doses that are allocated in Phase 1B for
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
people who are in communities that are
 
04:59:13.610 --> 04:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
disproportionately infected but we have
 
04:59:15.770 --> 04:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
no information about how much of that
 
04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine has actually gone into the arms
 
04:59:21.050 --> 04:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
of people in the disaffected community
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
so it's one thing to allocate the doses
 
04:59:26.570 --> 04:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
and that's a nice thought and it's it's
 
04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
something we absolutely should be doing
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
but the other part of it is is do we
 
04:59:33.410 --> 04:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
have the data that allows us to
 
04:59:35.390 --> 04:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
understand whether or not that is
 
04:59:37.788 --> 04:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
actually happening
 
04:59:39.590 --> 04:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and right now
 
04:59:41.330 --> 04:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
um the data may be collected I don't
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
know I don't have this visibility into
 
04:59:45.410 --> 04:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
that but what I do know is that when I
 
04:59:47.090 --> 04:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
go to the resources that the state of
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is designed I can't find
 
04:59:51.830 --> 04:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
the answer to questions like that and
 
04:59:53.868 --> 04:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
and I think that it's really critical
 
04:59:56.570 --> 04:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
that we do have answers to questions
 
05:00:01.070 --> 05:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and with that uh with that I'll I'll
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
stop and if anyone has any questions I'd
 
05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.250 --> 05:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
um uh Maura Condon has signed up to
 
05:00:21.890 --> 05:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition
 
05:00:24.170 --> 05:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
to the bill and we will get to her as
 
05:00:28.490 --> 05:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
soon as I call on representative Shapiro
 
05:00:31.490 --> 05:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
05:00:33.650 --> 05:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Muse
 
05:00:33.660 --> 05:00:35.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Muse
um

05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:39.170 --> 05:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
so we have a bill before us that does
 
05:00:40.970 --> 05:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
certain things and then we've had a lot
 
05:00:44.750 --> 05:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
of testimony with various levels of
 
05:00:46.670 --> 05:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
critique about the job that the
 
05:00:49.850 --> 05:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
dashboard is doing currently so I would
 
05:00:53.090 --> 05:00:53.100 align:start position:0%
ask you given your particular critique
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
of some of the shortcomings
 
05:00:58.368 --> 05:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
what in this bill
 
05:01:01.250 --> 05:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
or what possibly in an amended bill
 
05:01:04.610 --> 05:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
would address some of those shortcomings
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
well first of all I want to say that I I
 
05:01:08.690 --> 05:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
do agree with the study commission I
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
think that that is something that it's
 
05:01:12.350 --> 05:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely essential when we're
 
05:01:14.448 --> 05:01:14.458 align:start position:0%
past this to be able to look back on it
 
05:01:16.430 --> 05:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
and to and to to learn from our
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
experience and to make sure that we get
 
05:01:20.750 --> 05:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
that down uh so that when the next
 
05:01:23.570 --> 05:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
pandemic comes along and and uh and it's
 
05:01:26.208 --> 05:01:26.218 align:start position:0%
inevitable inevitable that one will
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
um we have that information we've done
 
05:01:30.050 --> 05:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
the work
 
05:01:32.330 --> 05:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's wonderful that we were
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
able to create a resource on the Fly and
 
05:01:36.288 --> 05:01:36.298 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are people who are
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
working very hard to continuously
 
05:01:40.610 --> 05:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
improve that resource so
 
05:01:43.368 --> 05:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I would say is to
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
me one of the most critical the most
 
05:01:47.030 --> 05:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
critical part of the bill is actually
 
05:01:50.448 --> 05:01:50.458 align:start position:0%
looking at this study commission I'm I I
 
05:01:52.730 --> 05:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
have uh I have reservations about
 
05:01:55.010 --> 05:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill as a whole because
 
05:01:56.330 --> 05:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
um hopefully everybody's going to be
 
05:01:59.208 --> 05:01:59.218 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and it might might be by the
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
time that a study committee is actually
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
able to meet you know to to do this so I
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
I question whether you know how much
 
05:02:08.208 --> 05:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to to get accomplished if
 
05:02:10.850 --> 05:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
there was one thing that I would pick uh
 
05:02:12.530 --> 05:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
to put in the dashboard that's not there
 
05:02:15.410 --> 05:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
now it's much better information on on
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinations I I wish we had better
 
05:02:20.570 --> 05:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
information uh as we were dealing with
 
05:02:23.390 --> 05:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
the long-term care crisis in our nursing
 
05:02:23.400 --> 05:02:24.650 align:start position:0%
the long-term care crisis in our nursing
homes

05:02:24.650 --> 05:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
homes
 
05:02:27.470 --> 05:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
um 75 of the deaths in our state have
 
05:02:29.390 --> 05:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
occurred in nursing homes and the
 
05:02:31.070 --> 05:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
information on the nursing home
 
05:02:34.128 --> 05:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
situation is very fragmented and again
 
05:02:36.410 --> 05:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
some information is available on the
 
05:02:39.050 --> 05:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
dashboard but the weekly case updates
 
05:02:42.410 --> 05:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
are only done one once a week in PDF
 
05:02:45.770 --> 05:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
form appended to a daily summary so the
 
05:02:48.170 --> 05:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
information has been kind of all over
 
05:02:50.390 --> 05:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
the place and it's not easy to get a
 
05:02:52.448 --> 05:02:52.458 align:start position:0%
full picture of what the situation is
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
what I would like to see us do is I'd
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
like to see us sort of learn from that
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
and say okay how can we repeat not
 
05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
repeat the mistake of not having done
 
05:03:04.910 --> 05:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
that earlier with long-term care and and
 
05:03:07.730 --> 05:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
how can we accelerate what can you know
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
at this critical point for vaccination
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
how can we make sure that um that better
 
05:03:15.770 --> 05:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
information on vaccinations is available
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
on the dashboard that would be the
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:38.090 --> 05:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:40.250 --> 05:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
chair would now like to call on Laura
 
05:03:40.260 --> 05:03:45.890 align:start position:0%
chair would now like to call on Laura
Condon

05:03:45.890 --> 05:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:48.530 --> 05:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:03:51.170 --> 05:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
good afternoon oh good you can hear me
 
05:03:54.288 --> 05:03:54.298 align:start position:0%
okay well good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
05:03:57.410 --> 05:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh committee members my name is Laura
 
05:03:59.810 --> 05:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
Condon I'm from Bedford I'm a volunteer
 
05:04:01.490 --> 05:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire director of advocacy with
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
the national vaccine information center
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I speak today in opposition to house
 
05:04:09.410 --> 05:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
bill 492. but first I would like to say
 
05:04:12.110 --> 05:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
that I thank representative Schultz for
 
05:04:14.030 --> 05:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
her efforts on this bill and
 
05:04:15.730 --> 05:04:15.740 align:start position:0%
specifically for bringing forth
 
05:04:18.350 --> 05:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
constituent concerns I think that is one
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
of the the greatest services that you as
 
05:04:23.390 --> 05:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
state reps provide is being our voices
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
for those members of the community and
 
05:04:27.410 --> 05:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
for that you know I much appreciate your
 
05:04:29.150 --> 05:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
your efforts
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
but I do know while we are currently
 
05:04:34.128 --> 05:04:34.138 align:start position:0%
experiencing covid-19 pandemic and there
 
05:04:35.690 --> 05:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
are emergency orders that have issued
 
05:04:37.610 --> 05:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
been issued to provide for emergency
 
05:04:40.250 --> 05:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
actions this bill proposes to put
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
certain reporting requirements into law
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
as a permanent feature this would not
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
allow for modification of action in
 
05:04:49.368 --> 05:04:49.378 align:start position:0%
reporting as a pandemic weakens and this
 
05:04:52.128 --> 05:04:52.138 align:start position:0%
becomes an endemic illness more typical
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
of influenza for which we do not have
 
05:04:56.448 --> 05:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
these types of extensive reporting
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
requirements as are proposed here
 
05:05:01.910 --> 05:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
I would say that DHHS has done a good
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
job of providing covid-19 information
 
05:05:07.310 --> 05:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
and details and updating it regularly on
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
their coveted website and being
 
05:05:12.288 --> 05:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
responsive to public concerns about any
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
sort of inadequacies of that data or
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
request for additional information and I
 
05:05:18.830 --> 05:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
think leaving that data reporting
 
05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
decisions to the department allows for
 
05:05:23.448 --> 05:05:23.458 align:start position:0%
the flexibility that is needed to report
 
05:05:26.448 --> 05:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
what is needed what is useful and when
 
05:05:29.270 --> 05:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's needed and when it's useful
 
05:05:31.970 --> 05:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
there there are there is a call for
 
05:05:34.490 --> 05:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
specific data here that concerns me and
 
05:05:36.110 --> 05:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
I would caution against the section
 
05:05:39.050 --> 05:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
calling for tracking vaccination metrics
 
05:05:41.628 --> 05:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
by age raised Town ineligibility
 
05:05:44.330 --> 05:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
category it's concerning for a number of
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
reasons in particular would involve the
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
collection and sorting of personal
 
05:05:50.810 --> 05:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
information and their obvious privacy
 
05:05:53.750 --> 05:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
improved security concerns
 
05:05:56.690 --> 05:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
the CDC and DHHS have already made
 
05:05:58.850 --> 05:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
recommendations on who might want to get
 
05:06:01.010 --> 05:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
a covid vaccine we do know there's
 
05:06:04.368 --> 05:06:04.378 align:start position:0%
categories A1 and B and such
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
not everyone can safely get a coveted
 
05:06:09.288 --> 05:06:09.298 align:start position:0%
shot and not everyone wants one
 
05:06:11.570 --> 05:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
these shots are a treatment offered to
 
05:06:13.250 --> 05:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
minimize symptoms for those at greatest
 
05:06:15.410 --> 05:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
risks they have not been shown to
 
05:06:17.208 --> 05:06:17.218 align:start position:0%
prevent infection or reduce the spread
 
05:06:19.850 --> 05:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
of infection treatment options are
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
important to have it's never one size
 
05:06:23.628 --> 05:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
fits all
 
05:06:25.850 --> 05:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
reporting of vaccination rates to the
 
05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
public Broken Out by various locations
 
05:06:29.628 --> 05:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
the demographics is not particularly
 
05:06:31.550 --> 05:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
useful to the public
 
05:06:33.650 --> 05:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
historically the purposes of such
 
05:06:36.530 --> 05:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
collection and posting of data is to
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
coerce individuals to submit to
 
05:06:38.400 --> 05:06:40.128 align:start position:0%
coerce individuals to submit to
vaccination

05:06:40.128 --> 05:06:40.138 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
05:06:41.990 --> 05:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
covet injections remain in the
 
05:06:44.090 --> 05:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
experimental phase under emergency use
 
05:06:47.208 --> 05:06:47.218 align:start position:0%
authorization and are not FDA licensed
 
05:06:49.610 --> 05:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
and this fact should be recognized and
 
05:06:49.620 --> 05:06:51.230 align:start position:0%
and this fact should be recognized and
appreciated

05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
05:06:54.050 --> 05:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
were this data to be compiled and
 
05:06:56.448 --> 05:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
presented it would be important to also
 
05:06:59.090 --> 05:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
include some of the data on the injuries
 
05:07:01.550 --> 05:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
and deaths being reported and a link to
 
05:07:07.868 --> 05:07:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:10.730 --> 05:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
DHHS already knows how many coveted
 
05:07:12.170 --> 05:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
shots have been received in the state
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
and how many have been injected
 
05:07:16.250 --> 05:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
aggregate vaccination rates are
 
05:07:18.530 --> 05:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
typically published information by DHHS
 
05:07:22.250 --> 05:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
without a statutory requirement to do so
 
05:07:24.288 --> 05:07:24.298 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that's appropriate at
 
05:07:26.090 --> 05:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
this time to be permanently collecting
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
sorting reporting data to the extent
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
that's called for in this bill although
 
05:07:32.708 --> 05:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
again I do appreciate very much
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz you know actions
 
05:07:37.128 --> 05:07:37.138 align:start position:0%
in bringing forth constituent concerns
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
but I do ask that this bill be
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately considered for an Ito
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you very much for
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
would you take any questions if there
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.810 --> 05:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
well thank you for being willing you get
 
05:08:01.610 --> 05:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
extra points for that
 
05:08:03.650 --> 05:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
well that's it folks and uh we have no
 
05:08:10.490 --> 05:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
one else signed up to speak and so
 
05:08:13.550 --> 05:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
really the question the opportunity I
 
05:08:17.150 --> 05:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
like to give is to the build sponsor to
 
05:08:20.628 --> 05:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
say are we ready and when we exec it is
 
05:08:23.208 --> 05:08:23.218 align:start position:0%
it good to go as it is do you wish to
 
05:08:25.850 --> 05:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
make changes and if you do just remember
 
05:08:29.868 --> 05:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:32.930 --> 05:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will say I have the
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
time and inclination to improve this
 
05:08:37.850 --> 05:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
bill I think the feedback I gained from
 
05:08:40.730 --> 05:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
Testament the other testimony and from
 
05:08:42.770 --> 05:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
the questions and comments from the
 
05:08:44.810 --> 05:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
committee I think that it should be
 
05:08:44.820 --> 05:08:46.490 align:start position:0%
committee I think that it should be
amended

05:08:46.490 --> 05:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
amended
 
05:08:49.550 --> 05:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
um open to doing that in a way that uh
 
05:08:52.430 --> 05:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
the majority of you would like and I
 
05:08:55.610 --> 05:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
will be calling many of you uh I did
 
05:08:57.830 --> 05:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
also send an email so if any of you
 
05:08:59.628 --> 05:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
would like specifically to make sure
 
05:09:02.570 --> 05:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
that I call you uh you can reply to that
 
05:09:04.730 --> 05:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
email and
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I just thank you for your patience
 
05:09:12.050 --> 05:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
this you are the experts uh and um
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
saying anything more would just prolong
 
05:09:17.570 --> 05:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
this and I appreciate your time
 
05:09:20.330 --> 05:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
and we'll be looking forward to what you
 
05:09:23.570 --> 05:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
present to us so thank you for coming
 
05:09:26.810 --> 05:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I close the
 
05:09:32.690 --> 05:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives Solway has asked the
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
chair for a brief
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
point of personal privilege
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so the chair calls on representative
 
05:09:45.600 --> 05:09:50.448 align:start position:0%
and so the chair calls on representative
soloway

05:09:50.448 --> 05:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:52.128 --> 05:09:52.138 align:start position:0%
the chair also calls on the
 
05:09:57.288 --> 05:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:57.298 --> 05:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
there

05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
is that better much better okay
 
05:10:04.010 --> 05:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to
 
05:10:06.190 --> 05:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
speak uh I'd like to speak under
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent for uh just a few
 
05:10:08.878 --> 05:10:09.610 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent for uh just a few
minutes

05:10:09.610 --> 05:10:09.620 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:10:13.850 --> 05:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
I want to put our current discussions of
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
a number of bills in a historical
 
05:10:16.798 --> 05:10:19.250 align:start position:0%
a number of bills in a historical
perspective

05:10:19.250 --> 05:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
05:10:21.288 --> 05:10:21.298 align:start position:0%
um about
 
05:10:22.368 --> 05:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
um boy
 
05:10:25.010 --> 05:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
over 20 years ago
 
05:10:27.650 --> 05:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
um it was a book published by a science
 
05:10:30.770 --> 05:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
writer named Lori Garrett that book was
 
05:10:33.650 --> 05:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
called of the coming plague
 
05:10:37.490 --> 05:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
and in it Laurie Garrett who is just a
 
05:10:40.970 --> 05:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
superb science journalist
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
um reminded us that we are in the midst
 
05:10:48.530 --> 05:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
at that time in the late 20th century
 
05:10:51.650 --> 05:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
now in the 21st century in the midst of
 
05:10:54.650 --> 05:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
not a disease
 
05:10:59.750 --> 05:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
but a series of waves of disease
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
that have assaulted us
 
05:11:07.570 --> 05:11:07.580 align:start position:0%
as a species for quite a long time
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
you can go back to the turn of the uh
 
05:11:15.890 --> 05:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
20th century you can go back to the
 
05:11:18.410 --> 05:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
Spanish Flu you can take a look at
 
05:11:22.610 --> 05:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis through the 1940s until we
 
05:11:26.208 --> 05:11:26.218 align:start position:0%
invented the mycins some of you may even
 
05:11:28.570 --> 05:11:28.580 align:start position:0%
be old enough to remember
 
05:11:32.208 --> 05:11:32.218 align:start position:0%
polio coming through New England in the
 
05:11:36.650 --> 05:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
1950s and if you think through your own
 
05:11:38.750 --> 05:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
ex lived experience
 
05:11:45.250 --> 05:11:45.260 align:start position:0%
and you think through the Advent of HIV
 
05:11:45.260 --> 05:11:47.090 align:start position:0%
and you think through the Advent of HIV
HPV

05:11:47.090 --> 05:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
HPV
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
the threats of uh SARS sudden acute
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
respiratory syndrome
 
05:11:56.930 --> 05:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
um the threat of Ebola coming
 
05:12:00.050 --> 05:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
um if you think through the Advent of
 
05:12:03.128 --> 05:12:03.138 align:start position:0%
MERS Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
 
05:12:07.250 --> 05:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
and now here we are wrestling with a
 
05:12:12.010 --> 05:12:12.020 align:start position:0%
whole new not a coronavirus but a family
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
of coronaviruses that are mutating and
 
05:12:19.070 --> 05:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
they're mutating dare I say faster than
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
we can develop effective vaccines to
 
05:12:24.050 --> 05:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
deal with them
 
05:12:28.128 --> 05:12:28.138 align:start position:0%
and what is lurking on the horizon that
 
05:12:31.128 --> 05:12:31.138 align:start position:0%
you probably don't know about is a new
 
05:12:33.830 --> 05:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
virus that has shown up in Asia Nipa
 
05:12:33.840 --> 05:12:35.030 align:start position:0%
virus that has shown up in Asia Nipa
virus

05:12:35.030 --> 05:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
virus
 
05:12:39.170 --> 05:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
a new strain of Avian Influenza that has
 
05:12:41.868 --> 05:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
shown up a renewed strain of Middle East
 
05:12:44.690 --> 05:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
Respiratory Syndrome all of this is
 
05:12:48.830 --> 05:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
coming our way so Laurie Garrett in the
 
05:12:51.230 --> 05:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
coming plague alerted us to the fact
 
05:12:57.230 --> 05:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
that we were seeing waves of virus waves
 
05:12:59.868 --> 05:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
of bacteria that
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
we probably had not seen before not only
 
05:13:05.930 --> 05:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
that if you look out there you may be
 
05:13:08.208 --> 05:13:08.218 align:start position:0%
aware that here in this country we had
 
05:13:10.250 --> 05:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
an epidemic over the last couple of
 
05:13:13.550 --> 05:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
years of whooping costs which we hadn't
 
05:13:15.830 --> 05:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
seen in decades
 
05:13:15.840 --> 05:13:16.490 align:start position:0%
seen in decades
um

05:13:16.490 --> 05:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
and you will be pleased to know that
 
05:13:19.080 --> 05:13:20.150 align:start position:0%
and you will be pleased to know that
Ebola

05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
Ebola
 
05:13:21.410 --> 05:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
is back
 
05:13:23.810 --> 05:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
we have an outbreak in the Democratic
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
Republic of the Congo that's new this
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
week so you have to see that I need to
 
05:13:31.550 --> 05:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
tell you that Laurie Garrett as I
 
05:13:33.650 --> 05:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
mentioned is a brilliant science writer
 
05:13:36.350 --> 05:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
and she wrote a follow-up book and the
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up book was called
 
05:13:41.090 --> 05:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
betrayal of trust
 
05:13:44.750 --> 05:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
and in it rather than simply looking at
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Advent of these diseases
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
she looked at our Public Health efforts
 
05:13:54.050 --> 05:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
around the world to contain these
 
05:13:54.060 --> 05:13:55.310 align:start position:0%
around the world to contain these
diseases

05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
05:13:58.730 --> 05:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
and what she said was in this book
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
we have trusted CDC who
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
National governments state governments
 
05:14:08.570 --> 05:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
local governments to protect human
 
05:14:12.650 --> 05:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
populations from these diseases and that
 
05:14:12.660 --> 05:14:14.150 align:start position:0%
populations from these diseases and that
trust

05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
trust
 
05:14:16.190 --> 05:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
has been betrayed
 
05:14:19.250 --> 05:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
we have not been successful we have not
 
05:14:21.050 --> 05:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
built the systems
 
05:14:24.530 --> 05:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
to control the arrival of these diseases
 
05:14:28.490 --> 05:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
and my friends here we sit in the middle
 
05:14:31.010 --> 05:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
of a covid pandemic
 
05:14:35.090 --> 05:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
and you know that before this is over
 
05:14:39.230 --> 05:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
we will have half a million dead
 
05:14:43.250 --> 05:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
from covet or covid Associated illness
 
05:14:46.368 --> 05:14:46.378 align:start position:0%
in this country it's here it's now you
 
05:14:49.610 --> 05:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
have lived in South quarantine for a
 
05:14:49.620 --> 05:14:50.690 align:start position:0%
have lived in South quarantine for a
year

05:14:50.690 --> 05:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:14:53.628 --> 05:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
and the question becomes what do we do
 
05:14:53.638 --> 05:14:54.890 align:start position:0%
and the question becomes what do we do
now

05:14:54.890 --> 05:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:14:57.410 --> 05:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
now I want to tell you
 
05:15:02.750 --> 05:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
that um I mistrust government
 
05:15:05.208 --> 05:15:05.218 align:start position:0%
and I know that's an odd sentiment for
 
05:15:07.730 --> 05:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
everybody on this committee
 
05:15:10.368 --> 05:15:10.378 align:start position:0%
that said tongue-in-cheek
 
05:15:10.378 --> 05:15:11.470 align:start position:0%
that said tongue-in-cheek
um

05:15:11.470 --> 05:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:15.590 --> 05:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
I value my privacy
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
I value my right to make decisions about
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
my own health
 
05:15:24.110 --> 05:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
I have no use for government intervening
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the relationship between patient and
 
05:15:30.170 --> 05:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
practitioner I believe that that is
 
05:15:33.230 --> 05:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
sacred on all counts
 
05:15:37.570 --> 05:15:37.580 align:start position:0%
I am a weary Watcher of immunizations
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
and public health interventions
 
05:15:39.958 --> 05:15:41.810 align:start position:0%
and public health interventions
generally

05:15:41.810 --> 05:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
generally
 
05:15:44.570 --> 05:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh if you feel that I am speaking
 
05:15:48.288 --> 05:15:48.298 align:start position:0%
without expertise let me tell you that
 
05:15:52.490 --> 05:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
the first volume on preventive medicine
 
05:15:55.368 --> 05:15:55.378 align:start position:0%
ever published for healthcare
 
05:15:57.410 --> 05:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
professionals called the course book in
 
05:16:00.288 --> 05:16:00.298 align:start position:0%
healthcare delivery was written by
 
05:16:00.298 --> 05:16:01.670 align:start position:0%
healthcare delivery was written by
me

05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:16:04.128 --> 05:16:04.138 align:start position:0%
the first volume on Health Care Delivery
 
05:16:06.430 --> 05:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
Systems for healthcare professionals
 
05:16:09.050 --> 05:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
introduction to Health Care Systems was
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
written by
 
05:16:10.560 --> 05:16:11.750 align:start position:0%
written by
me

05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
two further volumes on epidemiology was
 
05:16:16.550 --> 05:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
written were written by
 
05:16:16.560 --> 05:16:18.170 align:start position:0%
written were written by
me

05:16:18.170 --> 05:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:16:20.570 --> 05:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
I've been there I understand Public
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
Health I understand how it works so now
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
my friends I have to balance
 
05:16:27.000 --> 05:16:29.230 align:start position:0%
my friends I have to balance
my

05:16:29.230 --> 05:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:16:32.448 --> 05:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
doubts and mistrusts about government
 
05:16:35.570 --> 05:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
intervention in my life the lives of my
 
05:16:38.510 --> 05:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
constituents I have to balance that with
 
05:16:41.390 --> 05:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
what I see as a looming Public Health
 
05:16:44.750 --> 05:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
threat and I have to ask is this a time
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
when we need to suspend our doubts and
 
05:16:51.288 --> 05:16:51.298 align:start position:0%
when we talk about permitting
 
05:16:54.890 --> 05:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
pharmacists to expand the numbers of
 
05:16:57.288 --> 05:16:57.298 align:start position:0%
health professionals to deal with health
 
05:17:00.410 --> 05:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
threats when we talk about entering data
 
05:17:02.810 --> 05:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
into databases as to who has been
 
05:17:05.628 --> 05:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and who is not I'm at the
 
05:17:07.970 --> 05:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
point where in order to make a decision
 
05:17:10.910 --> 05:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
on all of these I now must fall on the
 
05:17:14.090 --> 05:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
side of Public Health intervention
 
05:17:17.690 --> 05:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
it's that looming it's that dangerous we
 
05:17:21.708 --> 05:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
need to make a very considered set of
 
05:17:21.718 --> 05:17:22.730 align:start position:0%
need to make a very considered set of
decisions

05:17:22.730 --> 05:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
05:17:26.030 --> 05:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
and I have to suspend
 
05:17:28.490 --> 05:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
my fears and doubts and my protections
 
05:17:30.890 --> 05:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
for my own privacy and that of my
 
05:17:33.470 --> 05:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
constituents my own protections for the
 
05:17:35.810 --> 05:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
sacredness of the practitioner patient
 
05:17:39.288 --> 05:17:39.298 align:start position:0%
relationship and I have to say no now is
 
05:17:41.930 --> 05:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
the time when we are all together and we
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
must make our commitments to the health
 
05:17:45.170 --> 05:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
of the community
 
05:17:48.110 --> 05:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
as public health thank you very much for
 
05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
listening I'm sorry to take so long but
 
05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
it was terribly important
 
05:17:53.448 --> 05:17:53.458 align:start position:0%
thank you my friend
 
05:17:55.490 --> 05:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
you're always worth listening to thank
 
05:17:55.500 --> 05:17:57.110 align:start position:0%
you're always worth listening to thank
you

05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:18:01.128 --> 05:18:01.138 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open now a an exact session
 
05:18:04.310 --> 05:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 617 that's not one of the
 
05:18:06.350 --> 05:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
ones that's on the list but this should
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
go real fast
 
05:18:10.128 --> 05:18:10.138 align:start position:0%
and as you know one of the things we try
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
to do here is come to
 
05:18:14.810 --> 05:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
a good understanding we try to get good
 
05:18:17.110 --> 05:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
work done and sometimes as I've been
 
05:18:20.448 --> 05:18:20.458 align:start position:0%
instructed The Way Forward is not
 
05:18:23.270 --> 05:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily by legislation it could be
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
by a remonstrance to a department
 
05:18:30.110 --> 05:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
so we had 617 before us about food
 
05:18:32.690 --> 05:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
safety training for child care workers
 
05:18:35.810 --> 05:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
in communities and I had a wonderful
 
05:18:39.470 --> 05:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
chat with representative Jan Schmidt who
 
05:18:41.690 --> 05:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
you'll remember presented the bill to us
 
05:18:44.448 --> 05:18:44.458 align:start position:0%
and more importantly she's had a
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful conversation with the good
 
05:18:49.368 --> 05:18:49.378 align:start position:0%
folks over at DHHS
 
05:18:52.730 --> 05:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
Fanfare is appropriate and her
 
05:18:54.650 --> 05:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
suggestion to us
 
05:18:57.830 --> 05:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
is that the bill should be itl'd and as
 
05:19:00.650 --> 05:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
one who italed or recommended itl of one
 
05:19:03.170 --> 05:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
of my bills to this committee uh
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
recently a year or two ago uh we're
 
05:19:11.090 --> 05:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
happy to do that so she suggests on this
 
05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
bill that it is not necessary what she
 
05:19:19.190 --> 05:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to have happen is happening now
 
05:19:22.970 --> 05:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the bill is moot
 
05:19:22.980 --> 05:19:23.690 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the bill is moot
um

05:19:23.690 --> 05:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:27.530 --> 05:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
I if there is no discussion on that
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:35.570 --> 05:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
having also received a communication
 
05:19:39.850 --> 05:19:39.860 align:start position:0%
from representative uh Schmidt I would
 
05:19:45.610 --> 05:19:45.620 align:start position:0%
move itl on uh six one on six one seven
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
and I would if there is a second like to
 
05:19:51.350 --> 05:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion
 
05:19:54.530 --> 05:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
um I already actually I have already
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
moved it and I've written the blurb and
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
disseminated the blurb uh pursuant to my
 
05:20:02.090 --> 05:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
conversation but if you would like to
 
05:20:03.948 --> 05:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
Second it representative Weber I'd
 
05:20:07.550 --> 05:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that would you no name
 
05:20:09.830 --> 05:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
was that yes
 
05:20:11.930 --> 05:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
I said no need
 
05:20:14.030 --> 05:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a little unusual for the
 
05:20:16.970 --> 05:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
Cure to be moving the bill but it's
 
05:20:19.310 --> 05:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
perfectly acceptable thank you and do we
 
05:20:21.730 --> 05:20:21.740 align:start position:0%
have a second
 
05:20:24.288 --> 05:20:24.298 align:start position:0%
all right representative Marsh now

thank you very much
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
well there's really a lot to say about
 
05:24:02.330 --> 05:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
the bill itself I'll confine myself here
 
05:24:03.650 --> 05:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that although no
 
05:24:07.610 --> 05:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
representatives of pharmacies testified
 
05:24:10.970 --> 05:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
at either the 2020 hearing or the 2021
 
05:24:10.980 --> 05:24:12.110 align:start position:0%
at either the 2020 hearing or the 2021
hearing

05:24:12.110 --> 05:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:24:12.120 --> 05:24:14.708 align:start position:0%
hearing
sorry

05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:24:17.090 --> 05:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
Representatives thank you go ahead go
 
05:24:19.010 --> 05:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
ahead represent or the 2021 hearing
 
05:24:20.750 --> 05:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
during this year representative Merchant
 
05:24:22.610 --> 05:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
kindly pointed out that the
 
05:24:24.288 --> 05:24:24.298 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to pharmacies through the
 
05:24:26.570 --> 05:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
pharmacy benefit manager was really not
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
well captured enough in the bill and the
 
05:24:30.050 --> 05:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
amendment that I introduced in the
 
05:24:30.060 --> 05:24:30.948 align:start position:0%
amendment that I introduced in the
hearing

05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:24:32.330 --> 05:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
so as a result a few days later
 
05:24:34.250 --> 05:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant Tyler Brannon of
 
05:24:35.270 --> 05:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
05:24:38.050 --> 05:24:38.060 align:start position:0%
and I met together to craft Amendment
 
05:24:38.060 --> 05:24:41.530 align:start position:0%
and I met together to craft Amendment
20210

05:24:41.530 --> 05:24:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:44.330 --> 05:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
site-0230h which is identical to the
 
05:24:45.650 --> 05:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
amendment that I introduced at the
 
05:24:47.690 --> 05:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
hearing with the exception of some new
 
05:24:50.030 --> 05:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
language in the amendment on page two
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
from lines 17-35 which would protect the
 
05:24:55.490 --> 05:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
pharmacies by ensuring that they would
 
05:24:57.650 --> 05:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed for administering an
 
05:25:00.110 --> 05:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
injection at a rate similar to Medical
 
05:25:00.120 --> 05:25:01.430 align:start position:0%
injection at a rate similar to Medical
providers

05:25:01.430 --> 05:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:25:03.890 --> 05:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
we use language adjuster by Tyler Bannon
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
of the commercially reasonable value
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
which is available from the New
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department for every
 
05:25:11.510 --> 05:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
CPT code
 
05:25:14.090 --> 05:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
the amendment also protects the insurers
 
05:25:16.368 --> 05:25:16.378 align:start position:0%
from being billed twice for a vaccine
 
05:25:18.708 --> 05:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
since they've already paid for it once
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
in the assessment and then language was
 
05:25:23.868 --> 05:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
added again at uh Tyler Brennan's
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion to provide for dispute
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
resolution between the insurer and the
 
05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
provider using the same mechanism as the
 
05:25:32.150 --> 05:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
balanced building statute
 
05:25:33.770 --> 05:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
subsequently representing Merchant
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
informed me that the pharmacies were
 
05:25:38.208 --> 05:25:38.218 align:start position:0%
still not satisfied so eight days ago he
 
05:25:39.948 --> 05:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
nicely convened a meeting of all of the
 
05:25:41.810 --> 05:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including the pharmacies to
 
05:25:44.150 --> 05:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
develop a new Amendment
 
05:25:45.890 --> 05:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
during this meeting it became clear to
 
05:25:47.810 --> 05:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
me that the chain Family Pharmacy is
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
really simply don't want to participate
 
05:25:52.128 --> 05:25:52.138 align:start position:0%
in this program so we crafted another
 
05:25:53.810 --> 05:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
amendment that divided the providers
 
05:25:55.190 --> 05:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
into either participating or
 
05:25:57.410 --> 05:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
non-participating using reimbursement
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
ideas and language from the pharmacy
 
05:26:01.730 --> 05:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
representatives and this really was a
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
pretty big compromise with the
 
05:26:05.570 --> 05:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
pharmacies as doing this actually
 
05:26:07.550 --> 05:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
lessens the savings of the adult program
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
by decreasing the size of the pool
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
because as representative Merchants said
 
05:26:14.448 --> 05:26:14.458 align:start position:0%
earlier today the pharmacies are doing
 
05:26:17.090 --> 05:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
about 30 percent of the adult vaccines
 
05:26:19.070 --> 05:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
so that final language was circulated to
 
05:26:20.628 --> 05:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
the parties involved that night asking
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
for response within a day but none of
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy Representatives responded
 
05:26:26.570 --> 05:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
over the next two days so in the
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
interest of time I went ahead and
 
05:26:30.708 --> 05:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
submitted that Amendment and then a few
 
05:26:32.208 --> 05:26:32.218 align:start position:0%
days later representative Merchant and I
 
05:26:34.010 --> 05:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
had our daily telephone call and he
 
05:26:35.448 --> 05:26:35.458 align:start position:0%
informed me that pharmacies were still
 
05:26:37.850 --> 05:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
not satisfied and subsequently the
 
05:26:39.650 --> 05:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
insurers noted some concerns that the
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
compromise gave away too much so I'm
 
05:26:43.970 --> 05:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
actually kind of bringing forth
 
05:26:46.490 --> 05:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
the Goldilocks Amendment the first one
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
was a little too cold the last one a
 
05:26:50.930 --> 05:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
little too hot but Amendment zero two
 
05:26:52.730 --> 05:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
three zero for right now at least is
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
just right
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
now it's important to realize that
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:26:58.868 --> 05:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
05:27:01.250 --> 05:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance plans New
 
05:27:04.010 --> 05:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
Futures and I revised multiple parts of
 
05:27:06.230 --> 05:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
the 2020 bill over the course of the one
 
05:27:07.788 --> 05:27:07.798 align:start position:0%
and a half months this fall to develop
 
05:27:09.530 --> 05:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
the 2021 bill
 
05:27:12.530 --> 05:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
we kill we still have three more months
 
05:27:15.770 --> 05:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
to fine-tune a new Amendment if needed
 
05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
regarding Pharmacy participation on this
 
05:27:18.360 --> 05:27:19.070 align:start position:0%
regarding Pharmacy participation on this
bill

05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:27:20.690 --> 05:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
that'll be as it goes through the second
 
05:27:22.788 --> 05:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
house committee and through the Senate
 
05:27:25.490 --> 05:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
before the Senate needs to act in early
 
05:27:25.500 --> 05:27:26.868 align:start position:0%
before the Senate needs to act in early
June

05:27:26.868 --> 05:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
June
 
05:27:29.628 --> 05:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
we remain open to continue to negotiate
 
05:27:31.610 --> 05:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
that degree in terms of the pharmacy's
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
participation in the program as we go
 
05:27:36.288 --> 05:27:36.298 align:start position:0%
forward but such negotiations do not
 
05:27:38.750 --> 05:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
require retain the bill as this is
 
05:27:40.430 --> 05:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
really the only issue that still needs
 
05:27:43.250 --> 05:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
to be resolved and delaying it
 
05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
particularly for those freshmen may not
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
understand this delays its
 
05:27:48.830 --> 05:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
implementation for a full year because
 
05:27:50.330 --> 05:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
it works done in the summer it doesn't
 
05:27:52.910 --> 05:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
even come into consideration until next
 
05:27:52.920 --> 05:27:54.230 align:start position:0%
even come into consideration until next
January

05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
January
 
05:27:56.690 --> 05:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
we really should be able to achieve this
 
05:27:58.970 --> 05:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
final language if necessary before it
 
05:28:00.530 --> 05:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
even gets to the second Committee of the
 
05:28:02.690 --> 05:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
house additional amendments are
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
frequently brought forth to a bill as it
 
05:28:06.230 --> 05:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
goes through the subsequent committees
 
05:28:06.240 --> 05:28:07.550 align:start position:0%
goes through the subsequent committees
so

05:28:07.550 --> 05:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
bottom line is I urge you to vote to
 
05:28:13.390 --> 05:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
accept Amendment 023h oh sorry
 
05:28:16.910 --> 05:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
0230h and then devote otpa so we can
 
05:28:18.410 --> 05:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
move this bill on to the next committee
 
05:28:20.570 --> 05:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
and again I'll continue to work with the
 
05:28:22.128 --> 05:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
pharmacy to finally come up with
 
05:28:24.650 --> 05:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
languages that they will be happy with
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and which will represent significant
 
05:28:30.170 --> 05:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
compromises from the other parties but
 
05:28:32.990 --> 05:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
which hopefully will give us at least a
 
05:28:35.030 --> 05:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
70 percent of the loaf instead of a full
 
05:28:36.708 --> 05:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
loaf if you will
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much will you take
 
05:28:40.368 --> 05:28:40.378 align:start position:0%
questions on your Amendment
 
05:28:43.368 --> 05:28:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:51.230 --> 05:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:54.890 --> 05:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:57.530 --> 05:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:28:58.730 --> 05:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
05:28:58.740 --> 05:29:00.230 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
in regards to looking at this
 
05:29:05.150 --> 05:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
what it's requiring is for the pharmacy
 
05:29:05.160 --> 05:29:06.830 align:start position:0%
what it's requiring is for the pharmacy
community

05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:29:10.010 --> 05:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
to utilize a system creative for the
 
05:29:11.930 --> 05:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
medical office community
 
05:29:14.810 --> 05:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
and not for the pharmacy Community I
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
think the concern that's still there
 
05:29:20.448 --> 05:29:20.458 align:start position:0%
is that we're taking a square peg and
 
05:29:23.330 --> 05:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
put it in a round hole it was not
 
05:29:25.128 --> 05:29:25.138 align:start position:0%
so people understand the medical
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
community now participates in the
 
05:29:29.570 --> 05:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
vaccine for Children's Program
 
05:29:32.090 --> 05:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
so therefore by adding adult vaccines
 
05:29:34.850 --> 05:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
onto an existing program
 
05:29:37.010 --> 05:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
is just building on something already in
 
05:29:37.020 --> 05:29:38.510 align:start position:0%
is just building on something already in
existence

05:29:38.510 --> 05:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
existence
 
05:29:41.150 --> 05:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
by taking something that is outside of
 
05:29:43.448 --> 05:29:43.458 align:start position:0%
normal operations for a pharmacy
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of the reimbursement model
 
05:29:49.128 --> 05:29:49.138 align:start position:0%
it still makes it difficult
 
05:29:50.810 --> 05:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
cumbersome for the pharmacy Community
 
05:29:50.820 --> 05:29:52.128 align:start position:0%
cumbersome for the pharmacy Community
utilized

05:29:52.128 --> 05:29:52.138 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
05:29:55.368 --> 05:29:55.378 align:start position:0%
I looked at the immunize Colorado and
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
they cited also that a major obstacle
 
05:30:00.830 --> 05:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
for the pharmacy Community to
 
05:30:03.770 --> 05:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
participate in a program like this
 
05:30:05.930 --> 05:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
was the financial burden but also the
 
05:30:07.490 --> 05:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
administrative burden
 
05:30:08.990 --> 05:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
that you're going outside of a
 
05:30:09.000 --> 05:30:10.128 align:start position:0%
that you're going outside of a
well-oiled

05:30:10.128 --> 05:30:10.138 align:start position:0%
well-oiled
 
05:30:13.550 --> 05:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
supply chain that works very well
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
and then trying to have them utilize a
 
05:30:19.850 --> 05:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
state program and we could look to covid
 
05:30:21.170 --> 05:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
he will now look into the pharmacy
 
05:30:23.510 --> 05:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
Community because the system they
 
05:30:25.610 --> 05:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
utilize is very efficient and very
 
05:30:27.650 --> 05:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
effective so regardless of the
 
05:30:30.170 --> 05:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
reimbursement model the concern that's
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
there is the system that we're going to
 
05:30:34.010 --> 05:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
require the pharmacy Community to
 
05:30:34.020 --> 05:30:35.090 align:start position:0%
require the pharmacy Community to
utilize

05:30:35.090 --> 05:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
05:30:36.350 --> 05:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
05:30:38.208 --> 05:30:38.218 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work within the pharmacy
 
05:30:39.708 --> 05:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
Community itself
 
05:30:40.970 --> 05:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you from personal
 
05:30:43.128 --> 05:30:43.138 align:start position:0%
experience having worked with that
 
05:30:43.138 --> 05:30:44.208 align:start position:0%
experience having worked with that
system

05:30:44.208 --> 05:30:44.218 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:30:46.670 --> 05:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
the delays in getting vaccines you
 
05:30:48.830 --> 05:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
cannot transfer a vaccine from one place
 
05:30:51.170 --> 05:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
to another you have to report the
 
05:30:53.270 --> 05:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
temperature in the refrigerators which
 
05:30:55.550 --> 05:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
is redundancy and so forth I still see
 
05:30:57.610 --> 05:30:57.620 align:start position:0%
what I'm starting to get to foreign
 
05:31:00.110 --> 05:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
as much as I look at this amendment
 
05:31:01.970 --> 05:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
going the right direction it's not there
 
05:31:04.610 --> 05:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
I did send out to the committee for
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
their review just shortly another
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
amendment which we talked about which
 
05:31:11.150 --> 05:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
would carve out the pharmacy Community
 
05:31:11.160 --> 05:31:13.070 align:start position:0%
would carve out the pharmacy Community
today

05:31:13.070 --> 05:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:31:16.250 --> 05:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
which is 66 percent of the loaf
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
work with the pharmacy Community going
 
05:31:18.120 --> 05:31:19.430 align:start position:0%
work with the pharmacy Community going
forward

05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:31:21.948 --> 05:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
and then build on the rest of them
 
05:31:24.410 --> 05:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
so that we can capture the full loaf
 
05:31:26.570 --> 05:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
but I think without the pharmacy
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
Community buy-in and support my concern
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
is that throughout the country
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
pharmacies do not participate in
 
05:31:36.410 --> 05:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
state-run programs unless for the
 
05:31:39.288 --> 05:31:39.298 align:start position:0%
uninsured so I just want to alert people
 
05:31:41.448 --> 05:31:41.458 align:start position:0%
that I want to say thank you
 
05:31:43.010 --> 05:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative Canuck for what you're
 
05:31:44.750 --> 05:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
doing with the amendment I think
 
05:31:46.910 --> 05:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentally it doesn't really solve
 
05:31:49.128 --> 05:31:49.138 align:start position:0%
the underlying problem and that is we
 
05:31:50.570 --> 05:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
have a system that was not created for
 
05:31:54.530 --> 05:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
pharmacy for asking them to utilize
 
05:31:57.770 --> 05:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
may I respond you may
 
05:31:59.390 --> 05:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
um fair enough I I was actually going to
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
address some of those issues but I
 
05:32:01.970 --> 05:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
thought they were more germane to the
 
05:32:03.830 --> 05:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
issue of passing the bill itself rather
 
05:32:06.530 --> 05:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
than the amendment but I'll go ahead and
 
05:32:08.510 --> 05:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
address them here
 
05:32:11.930 --> 05:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
um first as I noted we I had a remember
 
05:32:14.570 --> 05:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
and I brought forth which would carve
 
05:32:17.030 --> 05:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
out the Pharmacists and the uh I have
 
05:32:18.590 --> 05:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
seen representative Merchant's Amendment
 
05:32:20.990 --> 05:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
the difficulty with that is that it
 
05:32:23.810 --> 05:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
requires shifting to a retrospective
 
05:32:26.510 --> 05:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
assessment and the current assessment is
 
05:32:28.730 --> 05:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
a prospective assessment
 
05:32:30.890 --> 05:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
this program has been in place for over
 
05:32:34.550 --> 05:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
15 years working extremely well and with
 
05:32:36.288 --> 05:32:36.298 align:start position:0%
that in mind trying to completely change
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
it over to a different system just
 
05:32:40.550 --> 05:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
didn't make sense and the amendment that
 
05:32:42.830 --> 05:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
we came up with that I thought it the
 
05:32:44.510 --> 05:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacist would be happy with because
 
05:32:46.610 --> 05:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
they were at the table when we developed
 
05:32:46.620 --> 05:32:47.750 align:start position:0%
they were at the table when we developed
it

05:32:47.750 --> 05:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:32:49.730 --> 05:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
um really gave away a lot and did allow
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
them to be non-participating if they
 
05:32:54.170 --> 05:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
wished to do so there were still some
 
05:32:55.610 --> 05:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
questions regard from the pharmacy
 
05:32:57.410 --> 05:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
Community about
 
05:32:59.090 --> 05:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
some of the issues about reimbursement
 
05:33:01.250 --> 05:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
which could conceivably just be simply
 
05:33:02.990 --> 05:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
stripped from that Amendment and they
 
05:33:04.368 --> 05:33:04.378 align:start position:0%
would just be able to either participate
 
05:33:06.590 --> 05:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
or not and that would work with the
 
05:33:10.550 --> 05:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
current system far better than would the
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative Merchants Amendment
 
05:33:14.510 --> 05:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
which would be you know reasonable if we
 
05:33:15.770 --> 05:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
were starting from scratch with a new
 
05:33:17.930 --> 05:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
system but not when we already have an
 
05:33:19.850 --> 05:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
existing system
 
05:33:19.860 --> 05:33:20.990 align:start position:0%
existing system
um

05:33:20.990 --> 05:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
if you will if you wish I could go ahead
 
05:33:25.910 --> 05:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
and address these other questions about
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
the supply chain and what the pharmacist
 
05:33:30.890 --> 05:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
burden would be at this point in time
 
05:33:33.170 --> 05:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
and perhaps I should because it was
 
05:33:34.850 --> 05:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
05:33:36.470 --> 05:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
um it's important to realize that the
 
05:33:37.850 --> 05:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
comment that no chain drug stores
 
05:33:39.288 --> 05:33:39.298 align:start position:0%
because you all you all got a letter
 
05:33:41.510 --> 05:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
from the lobbyist for the Coalition for
 
05:33:43.430 --> 05:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chain drug stores I think
 
05:33:45.890 --> 05:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
it was just yesterday or day before and
 
05:33:48.110 --> 05:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
the problem is it reflects a lack of
 
05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
understanding how the program works
 
05:33:52.010 --> 05:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
he said that the chain drugstores
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't participate in a meaningful way
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
well they certainly can and we want them
 
05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
to he talked about concerns about how
 
05:34:00.830 --> 05:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
the state stores and distributes
 
05:34:03.410 --> 05:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
vaccines but that's not a real concern
 
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
the state does not store the vaccines
 
05:34:08.030 --> 05:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccines are shipped directly to
 
05:34:09.830 --> 05:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
their Provider from McKesson who's the
 
05:34:12.770 --> 05:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
federal distributor and it is not at all
 
05:34:15.350 --> 05:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
like the trouble played covet vaccine
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
supply chain
 
05:34:20.628 --> 05:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
it is an entirely different issue the
 
05:34:21.708 --> 05:34:21.718 align:start position:0%
current system really works
 
05:34:23.810 --> 05:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
exceptionally well the small practice
 
05:34:26.208 --> 05:34:26.218 align:start position:0%
that I worked in in Conway
 
05:34:28.430 --> 05:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
as I spoke to both of our pediatricians
 
05:34:30.590 --> 05:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
about this they have been extremely
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
happy with the program they have never
 
05:34:33.890 --> 05:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
ever had a problem with supply chain
 
05:34:33.900 --> 05:34:35.270 align:start position:0%
ever had a problem with supply chain
problems

05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
problems
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
the comment was made in that letter and
 
05:34:40.368 --> 05:34:40.378 align:start position:0%
also by representing immersion that Jane
 
05:34:42.350 --> 05:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
drugstores aren't doing the for example
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
in this state the vaccines for children
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
program but that's not really surprising
 
05:34:49.430 --> 05:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
because the pharmacies are not allowed
 
05:34:50.930 --> 05:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate children in New Hampshire
 
05:34:53.330 --> 05:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
except for flu so they wouldn't be able
 
05:34:55.430 --> 05:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
to have participated in it even if they
 
05:34:58.670 --> 05:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
chose to at least at this point in time
 
05:35:00.770 --> 05:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
as far as the burdensome requirements
 
05:35:02.448 --> 05:35:02.458 align:start position:0%
for storage of federally supplied
 
05:35:04.490 --> 05:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
vaccines it's important to realize that
 
05:35:06.410 --> 05:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
those CDC requirements
 
05:35:08.750 --> 05:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
our reason actually just simply best
 
05:35:11.628 --> 05:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
practices to assure safe storage of
 
05:35:13.850 --> 05:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
vaccines so that they're safe to use
 
05:35:15.470 --> 05:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
and they're effective when they're given
 
05:35:17.448 --> 05:35:17.458 align:start position:0%
because poor storage can lead to either
 
05:35:19.550 --> 05:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
complete loss of thousands of dollars of
 
05:35:21.708 --> 05:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines or a loss of potency of
 
05:35:23.690 --> 05:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
vaccines which could then be unknowingly
 
05:35:26.330 --> 05:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
still be injected I would say that if
 
05:35:27.708 --> 05:35:27.718 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies aren't following those
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
best practices they maybe should and I
 
05:35:32.030 --> 05:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
would also again note that the small
 
05:35:34.368 --> 05:35:34.378 align:start position:0%
practice I worked in in Conway with only
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
two pediatricians handles it just fine
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have any trouble
 
05:35:41.330 --> 05:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
so the other thing was about you know
 
05:35:43.070 --> 05:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
moving vaccines from one place to
 
05:35:43.080 --> 05:35:44.390 align:start position:0%
moving vaccines from one place to
another

05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:35:46.250 --> 05:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
um though that can be done I confirmed
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
that with Dr Beth the other chief of
 
05:35:49.850 --> 05:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
infectious disease Bureau they're the
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
ones that administer this program she
 
05:35:53.448 --> 05:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
stated that in the current program
 
05:35:56.510 --> 05:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
providers can transfer vaccines as long
 
05:35:58.970 --> 05:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
as they document the transfer
 
05:36:01.970 --> 05:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
so the point is I do appreciate that we
 
05:36:04.730 --> 05:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
have not reached a final uh conclusion I
 
05:36:05.930 --> 05:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's obvious guys
 
05:36:07.730 --> 05:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that because rep Richard
 
05:36:09.288 --> 05:36:09.298 align:start position:0%
and I are talking about this weekly
 
05:36:12.650 --> 05:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
aren't agreeing but this is not a burden
 
05:36:15.530 --> 05:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
which should take this bill and require
 
05:36:18.288 --> 05:36:18.298 align:start position:0%
it to either die or be retained and go
 
05:36:20.448 --> 05:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
through some process this summer and be
 
05:36:22.670 --> 05:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
delayed by a whole year we can accept
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment as I said I did a lot of
 
05:36:26.810 --> 05:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
rewrite on this in the fall over a month
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
and a half multiple meetings with
 
05:36:31.250 --> 05:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
providers stakeholders I mean and we can
 
05:36:33.410 --> 05:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
do and then probably the next two weeks
 
05:36:35.208 --> 05:36:35.218 align:start position:0%
because I think rep Merchant and I have
 
05:36:36.230 --> 05:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
really at this point pretty well
 
05:36:38.270 --> 05:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
identified some of the issues and I
 
05:36:39.650 --> 05:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
think we can fine tune a couple of
 
05:36:41.570 --> 05:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
issues now and have an amendment before
 
05:36:43.670 --> 05:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
it even gets to the second committee
 
05:36:47.150 --> 05:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
that we probably would agree on again I
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
know that
 
05:36:50.090 --> 05:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine Association new
 
05:36:52.788 --> 05:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
Futures DHHS they really don't want to
 
05:36:55.670 --> 05:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
have this program diluted and have it
 
05:36:58.690 --> 05:36:58.700 align:start position:0%
with only 66 percent of participation
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
but everybody has to make compromises
 
05:37:03.830 --> 05:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
and they may need to compromise on that
 
05:37:06.170 --> 05:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
to satisfy the desires of the pharmacy
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
Community to just keep running theirs
 
05:37:10.128 --> 05:37:10.138 align:start position:0%
separately and doing their own
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
negotiations and I certainly am
 
05:37:14.090 --> 05:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
comfortable with making those kinds of
 
05:37:17.448 --> 05:37:17.458 align:start position:0%
compromises but today if we decide not
 
05:37:19.970 --> 05:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
to you know approve this
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
it just either dies or gets retained and
 
05:37:23.390 --> 05:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
then has to sit around for another whole
 
05:37:25.970 --> 05:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
year as Charlie McMahon likes to say we
 
05:37:27.230 --> 05:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
need to get this done while we're still
 
05:37:29.208 --> 05:37:29.218 align:start position:0%
young we can get this out of our
 
05:37:31.010 --> 05:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
committee get it to the next committee
 
05:37:33.470 --> 05:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
where they can where uh where Merchant
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I will continue to work with those
 
05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders and get some final
 
05:37:39.948 --> 05:37:39.958 align:start position:0%
language and if we never can get there
 
05:37:42.530 --> 05:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
it'll get retained or italed and the
 
05:37:45.530 --> 05:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
next committee or in the Senate and you
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
know Gary I want to keep working with
 
05:37:49.250 --> 05:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
you we are still friends and we talk
 
05:37:51.190 --> 05:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
every week every day usually
 
05:37:54.590 --> 05:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
if I if I can say I I want to say this
 
05:37:56.810 --> 05:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
to everyone here
 
05:37:56.820 --> 05:37:58.368 align:start position:0%
to everyone here
um

05:37:58.368 --> 05:37:58.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:00.890 --> 05:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
I want to recognize the work that
 
05:38:03.410 --> 05:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
this the sponsors put into this bill and
 
05:38:06.110 --> 05:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to to uh
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
05:38:10.368 --> 05:38:10.378 align:start position:0%
un difficult for him or anyone else but
 
05:38:12.590 --> 05:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
also at the same time if I know
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
something's got a flaw in it
 
05:38:17.510 --> 05:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I let it go forward without dealing
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
with that flaw then my concern is we
 
05:38:20.040 --> 05:38:20.750 align:start position:0%
with that flaw then my concern is we
have

05:38:20.750 --> 05:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:38:23.390 --> 05:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
the potential create legislation that we
 
05:38:25.910 --> 05:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
could possibly cause a lot of issues in
 
05:38:28.550 --> 05:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
the settings for access to vaccines we
 
05:38:30.170 --> 05:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
just talked about how important the
 
05:38:32.690 --> 05:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
access point is just to give you a heads
 
05:38:32.700 --> 05:38:33.288 align:start position:0%
access point is just to give you a heads
up

05:38:33.288 --> 05:38:33.298 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:38:35.930 --> 05:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
I talked to a board member in the state
 
05:38:37.850 --> 05:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
of Vermont because Vermont also has an
 
05:38:40.910 --> 05:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
adult program not one Pharmacy folks
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
participates in the program for children
 
05:38:44.510 --> 05:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
or for the adult program
 
05:38:46.910 --> 05:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
number two I looked at Alaska
 
05:38:48.770 --> 05:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
I looked at all the registered providers
 
05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
they have on Alaska on the website you
 
05:38:51.470 --> 05:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
can go there and I'll send it to you
 
05:38:53.570 --> 05:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
there's not one Pharmacy folks that's in
 
05:38:53.580 --> 05:38:54.590 align:start position:0%
there's not one Pharmacy folks that's in
it

05:38:54.590 --> 05:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:38:57.770 --> 05:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm just cautioning people is that
 
05:38:59.628 --> 05:38:59.638 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy Community is a very major
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
component of access to vaccines and
 
05:39:04.788 --> 05:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a reason in the other
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
states that pharmacies have not
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
participated in the program number two
 
05:39:10.750 --> 05:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
as far as looking at things
 
05:39:14.030 --> 05:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
retrospectively versus prospectively
 
05:39:16.070 --> 05:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
we could break it apart and saying if
 
05:39:18.170 --> 05:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's a children it's done under the
 
05:39:20.030 --> 05:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
current model but this is a new
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity for adults and saying going
 
05:39:23.570 --> 05:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
forward to Department health Team
 
05:39:26.330 --> 05:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
Services we build a different model for
 
05:39:28.490 --> 05:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
the adults so therefore the insurance
 
05:39:28.500 --> 05:39:29.690 align:start position:0%
the adults so therefore the insurance
companies

05:39:29.690 --> 05:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
companies
 
05:39:31.430 --> 05:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
are basically utilizing two different
 
05:39:31.440 --> 05:39:32.930 align:start position:0%
are basically utilizing two different
systems

05:39:32.930 --> 05:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
systems
 
05:39:35.448 --> 05:39:35.458 align:start position:0%
in order to accommodate that and I think
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying to my friend on on my
 
05:39:40.730 --> 05:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
own side of the aisle is that I don't
 
05:39:41.990 --> 05:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
want to work with you but I just think
 
05:39:43.610 --> 05:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not ready for prime
 
05:39:43.620 --> 05:39:44.570 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not ready for prime
time

05:39:44.570 --> 05:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:39:46.910 --> 05:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I think to move it forward even out
 
05:39:48.410 --> 05:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
of the committee until we have buy-in
 
05:39:49.550 --> 05:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
from the pharmacy community and deal
 
05:39:50.990 --> 05:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
with their concerns which I think are
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
significant it's not a logical thing to
 
05:39:56.448 --> 05:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
do so I would vote to retain the bill
 
05:39:59.330 --> 05:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
versus to uh pass the amendment but I
 
05:40:00.650 --> 05:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
will pass the amendment because it's
 
05:40:02.810 --> 05:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
better than what the bill has but I
 
05:40:05.270 --> 05:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
would definitely vote against the bill
 
05:40:12.050 --> 05:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
you were unmuted now you muted yourself
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
my buttons don't work right I know that
 
05:40:20.208 --> 05:40:20.218 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways it comes with age thank
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome to ask one of the two
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
of you probably representative can Eric
 
05:40:26.868 --> 05:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
would be the best one to ask
 
05:40:29.810 --> 05:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
he's basically saying that he agrees the
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill right now is not ready for prime
 
05:40:33.650 --> 05:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
time but he thinks he can work on it
 
05:40:35.690 --> 05:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
while it goes through another committee
 
05:40:38.150 --> 05:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
and at that point we can still vote to
 
05:40:40.730 --> 05:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
retain it if it's not ready but at this
 
05:40:42.288 --> 05:40:42.298 align:start position:0%
point I say we ought to move it along
 
05:40:45.230 --> 05:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
and and pass it because one of the
 
05:40:46.610 --> 05:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
things if we can get it through this
 
05:40:48.890 --> 05:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
year that saves a stage four million
 
05:40:48.900 --> 05:40:49.788 align:start position:0%
year that saves a stage four million
dollars

05:40:49.788 --> 05:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:40:52.430 --> 05:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
which we're going to lose if we delay it
 
05:40:54.970 --> 05:40:54.980 align:start position:0%
until next year so I would ask that we
 
05:40:57.530 --> 05:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
do what we can to move it along at least
 
05:40:59.208 --> 05:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
at this point and commit ourselves to
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
try to work out a a compromise that
 
05:41:04.128 --> 05:41:04.138 align:start position:0%
meets everybody's needs
 
05:41:06.770 --> 05:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you am I correct in that
 
05:41:08.510 --> 05:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
assumption but I have a point of order
 
05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes you can
 
05:41:12.770 --> 05:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:41:12.780 --> 05:41:13.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:41:13.490 --> 05:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:16.010 --> 05:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
it is correct that if we move it forward
 
05:41:17.930 --> 05:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:41:21.070 --> 05:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
you muted yourself oh sorry
 
05:41:25.730 --> 05:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
those buttons are tricky I'm I'm sorry
 
05:41:28.850 --> 05:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm conscious of having intruded a
 
05:41:31.910 --> 05:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
dog into the frame and the word into an
 
05:41:34.368 --> 05:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
unmuted microphone earlier which I
 
05:41:37.490 --> 05:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
apologize to the entire committee and so
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to err on the other side
 
05:41:40.020 --> 05:41:43.810 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to err on the other side
um

05:41:43.810 --> 05:41:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:48.410 --> 05:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
my point of order was that yes if it is
 
05:41:50.690 --> 05:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
moved on to another committee it can
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
then be retained but it will not be
 
05:41:54.470 --> 05:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
retained by the Health and Human
 
05:41:56.990 --> 05:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
Services committee it will be retained
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
by the finance committee and if
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
you think that the finance committee is
 
05:42:05.448 --> 05:42:05.458 align:start position:0%
going to devote itself to the finer
 
05:42:08.448 --> 05:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
points that we're talking about here
 
05:42:11.090 --> 05:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
um You probably really ought to think
 
05:42:11.100 --> 05:42:12.170 align:start position:0%
um You probably really ought to think
again

05:42:12.170 --> 05:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I have a great regard for them but
 
05:42:16.490 --> 05:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's not their Forte
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
um would this representative Weber go to
 
05:42:21.310 --> 05:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
finance or finance division free
 
05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh it would undoubtedly go to division
 
05:42:26.208 --> 05:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
three because everything in finance goes
 
05:42:28.550 --> 05:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
to a division uh I simply asked the
 
05:42:30.350 --> 05:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
clerk where it was going in hopes that
 
05:42:33.410 --> 05:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
it would go to Commerce which might have
 
05:42:35.150 --> 05:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
been a much more
 
05:42:38.930 --> 05:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
helpful place for it to go on issues of
 
05:42:42.470 --> 05:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
both insurance payments and business
 
05:42:45.250 --> 05:42:45.260 align:start position:0%
models because that's what Commerce does
 
05:42:50.330 --> 05:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
it does not have a huge amount of Health
 
05:42:52.850 --> 05:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
content of the sort that this committee
 
05:42:56.090 --> 05:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
deals with but that is water that's gone
 
05:42:59.810 --> 05:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
both under the bridge and over the dam
 
05:42:59.820 --> 05:43:01.430 align:start position:0%
both under the bridge and over the dam
um

05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:04.910 --> 05:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say that I have listened
 
05:43:09.050 --> 05:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
very carefully to both of my esteemed
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues and I esteem both of them
 
05:43:13.010 --> 05:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:43:13.020 --> 05:43:14.208 align:start position:0%
very much
um

05:43:14.208 --> 05:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:16.970 --> 05:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
but I've also done a great deal of
 
05:43:16.980 --> 05:43:18.890 align:start position:0%
but I've also done a great deal of
negotiation

05:43:18.890 --> 05:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
and mediation in my life
 
05:43:24.288 --> 05:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
and I think the likelihood
 
05:43:26.628 --> 05:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
that this is going to get resolved in
 
05:43:32.270 --> 05:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
the next two weeks is very very slim
 
05:43:35.390 --> 05:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
um that's that's just my observation and
 
05:43:41.288 --> 05:43:41.298 align:start position:0%
it is a concern of mine and I am
 
05:43:45.410 --> 05:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
conscious of a growing concern arising
 
05:43:48.170 --> 05:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
out of the concerns of new futures
 
05:43:51.770 --> 05:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh about a number of the pharmacy bills
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
all of which are interrelated in
 
05:43:56.930 --> 05:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
interesting ways
 
05:43:59.170 --> 05:43:59.180 align:start position:0%
um but I'm
 
05:44:02.570 --> 05:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
becoming more concerned about the
 
05:44:06.048 --> 05:44:06.058 align:start position:0%
interrelation and getting it right so
 
05:44:08.330 --> 05:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
um those are that's as far as I've gone
 
05:44:10.610 --> 05:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
in my thinking so far and what I'm going
 
05:44:13.730 --> 05:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
to do about it is another question but
 
05:44:16.670 --> 05:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
in your experience and that was beyond a
 
05:44:18.948 --> 05:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
point of order and I'm sorry for having
 
05:44:21.770 --> 05:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
exceeded what I was recognized for but
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask soon anyway
 
05:44:26.090 --> 05:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
um in your experience representative
 
05:44:28.430 --> 05:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
Weber when things come out of the house
 
05:44:30.830 --> 05:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
and go over to the Senate
 
05:44:34.010 --> 05:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
there would be another chance to amend
 
05:44:34.020 --> 05:44:34.810 align:start position:0%
there would be another chance to amend
this

05:44:34.810 --> 05:44:34.820 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:44:34.820 --> 05:44:36.530 align:start position:0%
this
happened

05:44:36.530 --> 05:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:44:38.390 --> 05:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
then of course it would have to go to a
 
05:44:39.890 --> 05:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
committee of conference but we're not
 
05:44:39.900 --> 05:44:41.390 align:start position:0%
committee of conference but we're not
done

05:44:41.390 --> 05:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:44:43.548 --> 05:44:43.558 align:start position:0%
when it leaves the house is that correct
 
05:44:46.250 --> 05:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely correct
 
05:44:51.470 --> 05:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I will also offer my observation that
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate often does not go into the
 
05:44:57.650 --> 05:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
depth that house
 
05:44:59.690 --> 05:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
committees do because they don't have
 
05:45:01.448 --> 05:45:01.458 align:start position:0%
the time and the energy
 
05:45:08.090 --> 05:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:11.690 --> 05:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
um depending on the issue on the input
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
of lobbyists than on the input of say
 
05:45:21.170 --> 05:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
a broad Coalition of expertise
 
05:45:22.670 --> 05:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
who else would like to speak remember
 
05:45:24.948 --> 05:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
this is an exact session it doesn't have
 
05:45:28.570 --> 05:45:28.580 align:start position:0%
to end in a question but it could
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
only if no one else okay yeah I will
 
05:45:35.750 --> 05:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
um they were just actually I do have a
 
05:45:37.610 --> 05:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
question and that is
 
05:45:40.368 --> 05:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
after it if if it does pass through here
 
05:45:42.650 --> 05:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
and it gets through the house
 
05:45:45.230 --> 05:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
could it be vacated to go to from uh
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
finance and go to Commerce that's the
 
05:45:49.190 --> 05:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
question the other one is just a point
 
05:45:51.410 --> 05:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
and that's the pharmacies even under the
 
05:45:53.770 --> 05:45:53.780 align:start position:0%
amendment uh zero two three zero
 
05:45:55.970 --> 05:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
pharmacies can still choose not to
 
05:45:57.590 --> 05:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
participate in the
 
05:46:00.410 --> 05:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
current program it's not mandatory but
 
05:46:02.150 --> 05:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
nearly everyone participates because it
 
05:46:04.610 --> 05:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
works so well and so a pharmacy still
 
05:46:07.310 --> 05:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to participate even under
 
05:46:11.690 --> 05:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
this uh bill and the amendment as it is
 
05:46:13.368 --> 05:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
sitting there so they could choose to
 
05:46:15.530 --> 05:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
all say we don't want to play but I
 
05:46:18.470 --> 05:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
would also say I've I've vowed that I
 
05:46:21.770 --> 05:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
would not say oh gee got it through I
 
05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
would continue to work with rep Merchant
 
05:46:27.048 --> 05:46:27.058 align:start position:0%
uh until we really got something that
 
05:46:29.090 --> 05:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
satisfied everybody and where everybody
 
05:46:31.368 --> 05:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
gave a little bit and I think that we I
 
05:46:33.170 --> 05:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
think we well I guess I'm more
 
05:46:35.810 --> 05:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
optimistic than representative Weber I I
 
05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
think we're so close and I can already
 
05:46:39.350 --> 05:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
see a couple of the solutions of just
 
05:46:41.448 --> 05:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
simply removing all the language about
 
05:46:43.970 --> 05:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
the reimbursements that is in the other
 
05:46:45.948 --> 05:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I didn't burden you all
 
05:46:47.930 --> 05:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
with because it was too much and just
 
05:46:49.310 --> 05:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
allow they're participating in the
 
05:46:51.770 --> 05:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
non-participating and be totally silent
 
05:46:53.208 --> 05:46:53.218 align:start position:0%
on the rest and just let those Market
 
05:46:55.250 --> 05:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
forces of the pbms and the pharmacies
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
manage that and I think that was really
 
05:46:59.390 --> 05:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
where the the pharmacy still had their
 
05:47:01.368 --> 05:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
concern and then it achieves just what
 
05:47:03.170 --> 05:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant wanted and that
 
05:47:06.530 --> 05:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
is that they don't have to participate
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
they they aren't affected and so I I
 
05:47:10.850 --> 05:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
think let's ask him that's I know my
 
05:47:12.770 --> 05:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
other people I know my other people that
 
05:47:14.750 --> 05:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
are working with another side are not
 
05:47:16.070 --> 05:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to be happy with me for saying
 
05:47:17.090 --> 05:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
that because they're going to be giving
 
05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
up a lot but that's the nature of
 
05:47:21.890 --> 05:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
compromise and so I you know I I'd vow
 
05:47:24.288 --> 05:47:24.298 align:start position:0%
to work on that I would not let it drop
 
05:47:26.810 --> 05:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant would you care
 
05:47:29.208 --> 05:47:29.218 align:start position:0%
to respond if you wish yes but I can
 
05:47:32.750 --> 05:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
progress the referral issue first
 
05:47:34.910 --> 05:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
sure yeah go ahead
 
05:47:36.590 --> 05:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
um it can't be referred to a third
 
05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
committee because we have deadlines
 
05:47:41.810 --> 05:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't mean third I'm in place of
 
05:47:41.820 --> 05:47:43.850 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't mean third I'm in place of
uh

05:47:43.850 --> 05:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:46.250 --> 05:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
I think that there is okay that's fine
 
05:47:48.770 --> 05:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
way to do that at this point
 
05:47:48.780 --> 05:47:49.850 align:start position:0%
way to do that at this point
okay

05:47:49.850 --> 05:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:47:52.190 --> 05:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
05:47:52.200 --> 05:47:54.170 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
chairman

05:47:54.170 --> 05:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:47:57.890 --> 05:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:01.368 --> 05:48:01.378 align:start position:0%
they can voluntarily participate or not
 
05:48:03.288 --> 05:48:03.298 align:start position:0%
participate the challenge though if they
 
05:48:03.298 --> 05:48:04.250 align:start position:0%
participate the challenge though if they
do

05:48:04.250 --> 05:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:48:05.810 --> 05:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we're trying to
 
05:48:07.490 --> 05:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
use the state program is the state you
 
05:48:09.410 --> 05:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
can buy the vaccine for 30 to 40 percent
 
05:48:12.708 --> 05:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
below the fair market value so if we do
 
05:48:15.170 --> 05:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
that for a pharmacy what we're asking
 
05:48:17.448 --> 05:48:17.458 align:start position:0%
them to do is to submit a claim to the
 
05:48:19.548 --> 05:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
insurance company at 30 to 40 percent
 
05:48:21.070 --> 05:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
below the cost
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
so I go back to the same thing is that
 
05:48:26.448 --> 05:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
why would a business
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
bill into the business model
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
something that's going to fill out at 30
 
05:48:33.650 --> 05:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
to 40 percent of what they could buy it
 
05:48:36.530 --> 05:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
at and take a loss on the vaccine
 
05:48:38.990 --> 05:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
and then only have if you will the
 
05:48:41.448 --> 05:48:41.458 align:start position:0%
administrative fee again one of the
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
things not to conflate things but it's
 
05:48:45.770 --> 05:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
part of it at least in the provider's
 
05:48:48.230 --> 05:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
office a provider can build for an
 
05:48:50.930 --> 05:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
office visit a pharmacy cannot
 
05:48:52.368 --> 05:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
um so it's not just a reimbursement
 
05:48:54.350 --> 05:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
model that's part of it but it's also
 
05:48:56.270 --> 05:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
the burdensome so we're asking them to
 
05:48:58.430 --> 05:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
increase their potential cost of doing
 
05:49:00.650 --> 05:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
business while we decrease their
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream coming into offset and
 
05:49:04.610 --> 05:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
maintain a business model my concern
 
05:49:06.830 --> 05:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
fundamentally is the pharmacy committee
 
05:49:09.170 --> 05:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
is really wants to work to make this
 
05:49:09.180 --> 05:49:10.850 align:start position:0%
is really wants to work to make this
thing

05:49:10.850 --> 05:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:49:12.650 --> 05:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
we just need to sit down around the
 
05:49:14.570 --> 05:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
table with all of us and figure out how
 
05:49:16.610 --> 05:49:16.620 align:start position:0%
to make it happen and I look at other
 
05:49:18.830 --> 05:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
states throughout the country that have
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
not embraced this in a pharmacy
 
05:49:22.730 --> 05:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
Community is not part of it and my
 
05:49:25.010 --> 05:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
concern to this committee is that if we
 
05:49:27.170 --> 05:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
lose the pharmacy Community which is a
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
possibility without getting the buy-in
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
support then would taking
 
05:49:34.970 --> 05:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
dollars and saving dollars but we're
 
05:49:36.770 --> 05:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
taking access points to patients have
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
utilized it conveniently and so forth so
 
05:49:40.610 --> 05:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's a trade-off and saying we could
 
05:49:42.170 --> 05:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
save a lot of money but then if we don't
 
05:49:43.850 --> 05:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
have higher vaccination rates and we're
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do everything in our state to
 
05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
increase vaccination rates not decrease
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates we know that they're
 
05:49:51.788 --> 05:49:51.798 align:start position:0%
low we need to find more ways to get
 
05:49:54.410 --> 05:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
vaccines in the patient's arms for all
 
05:49:56.390 --> 05:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
the reasons that you do it and not
 
05:49:58.010 --> 05:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
finding ways to just save money so we
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
have to balance the issue of trying to
 
05:50:02.628 --> 05:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
save money with access and being sure
 
05:50:04.490 --> 05:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
the patient at the end of the day do in
 
05:50:07.010 --> 05:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
fact get the vaccines that they need not
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
just to save money representative knurk
 
05:50:14.448 --> 05:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think first off the issue is
 
05:50:16.310 --> 05:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
that if we say Hey you can either
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
participate or not if uh first of all
 
05:50:21.708 --> 05:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies may have very good cheap
 
05:50:23.628 --> 05:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
Supply chains too and if they can buy
 
05:50:25.970 --> 05:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
the vaccine at a cheaper rate they're
 
05:50:27.288 --> 05:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
still going to negotiate with the
 
05:50:28.910 --> 05:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company for the rates they're
 
05:50:30.110 --> 05:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to get paid that's their business
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
just like they do now
 
05:50:32.160 --> 05:50:32.810 align:start position:0%
just like they do now
um

05:50:32.810 --> 05:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:34.610 --> 05:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
but the thing is if they can't get that
 
05:50:36.110 --> 05:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
they might choose to use the state
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
program it's like any other business
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
decision you you weigh not just your
 
05:50:42.170 --> 05:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
costs but your convenience you may say
 
05:50:44.208 --> 05:50:44.218 align:start position:0%
gosh I can get it on Amazon two bucks
 
05:50:46.070 --> 05:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
cheaper than this store down the street
 
05:50:47.390 --> 05:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
but I can go down the store down the
 
05:50:48.708 --> 05:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
streets this afternoon and it's in my
 
05:50:50.570 --> 05:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
hand and you make that decision that
 
05:50:52.310 --> 05:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
that value to you is worth paying that
 
05:50:55.128 --> 05:50:55.138 align:start position:0%
extra couple of bucks here because it
 
05:50:56.510 --> 05:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
drives traffic into the store and there
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
are the things they may say yeah I lose
 
05:51:00.530 --> 05:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
a buck or two on it but it's for on a
 
05:51:03.048 --> 05:51:03.058 align:start position:0%
particular vaccine but I want to do that
 
05:51:04.730 --> 05:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
because it helps me in my bottom line
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's a choice you make and they they
 
05:51:08.750 --> 05:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
can the goal of what I was getting at
 
05:51:10.368 --> 05:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
was it would be a choice
 
05:51:13.128 --> 05:51:13.138 align:start position:0%
it'd be their choice and so I'd be
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
comfortable that
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
um it is interesting to note though the
 
05:51:19.430 --> 05:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
comment about increasing vaccine rates
 
05:51:19.440 --> 05:51:20.090 align:start position:0%
comment about increasing vaccine rates
um

05:51:20.090 --> 05:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:23.570 --> 05:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
it is I get my flu shots at the pharmacy
 
05:51:25.310 --> 05:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
because I do like it I do like the
 
05:51:25.320 --> 05:51:26.810 align:start position:0%
because I do like it I do like the
accessibility

05:51:26.810 --> 05:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
accessibility
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
um like if you're doing up getting
 
05:51:30.288 --> 05:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
groceries it's kind of nice but it's
 
05:51:32.270 --> 05:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
interesting I went back and dug up the
 
05:51:34.250 --> 05:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
data on the adult flu shots because
 
05:51:35.990 --> 05:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's about the only thing we have
 
05:51:37.610 --> 05:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
where we have old enough data to see
 
05:51:39.708 --> 05:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
what the trends are and in the period
 
05:51:41.628 --> 05:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
the three years prior to us allowing
 
05:51:44.570 --> 05:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
pharmacists to do vaccines for flu for
 
05:51:47.090 --> 05:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
adults the vaccine the percentage of
 
05:51:49.190 --> 05:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
adults 18 and older getting flu vaccine
 
05:51:51.530 --> 05:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire was 42 percent I didn't
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
count the year of transition because
 
05:51:54.170 --> 05:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
that'll be fluky
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
but in the eight years following
 
05:51:59.690 --> 05:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
allowing pharmacists to do it it was 44
 
05:52:04.368 --> 05:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
with a variation between 38 and 49 which
 
05:52:05.810 --> 05:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
means that we didn't actually see an
 
05:52:07.670 --> 05:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
increased rate of vaccination in the
 
05:52:09.230 --> 05:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
state we just saw a different point of
 
05:52:11.208 --> 05:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
service now again that doesn't discount
 
05:52:13.490 --> 05:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
that I get mine there I think it is a
 
05:52:14.750 --> 05:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
convenience thing and I would agree with
 
05:52:17.990 --> 05:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
it again what I get back to is if we
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
change it to the amendment I didn't
 
05:52:20.990 --> 05:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
bring forward because the pharmacist
 
05:52:22.850 --> 05:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
didn't like it
 
05:52:25.310 --> 05:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
um I but I think we I still we could
 
05:52:26.690 --> 05:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
work on that and get rid of out of the
 
05:52:28.610 --> 05:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
language so they have total flexibility
 
05:52:30.650 --> 05:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
the same they have now in terms of
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
negotiating with the pbms and the
 
05:52:34.730 --> 05:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
insurers I mean between the pbms and
 
05:52:37.850 --> 05:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
insurers if we did that
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
um they've got just what they have right
 
05:52:41.930 --> 05:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
now we would not change anything for
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
them but if there's a small change of
 
05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
sorry a small Independent Pharmacy if
 
05:52:48.350 --> 05:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
they wish to participate they could hop
 
05:52:50.510 --> 05:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
in and participate if they didn't wish
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
to they wouldn't we could also go to
 
05:52:54.230 --> 05:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
just say no pharmacies but it wouldn't
 
05:52:56.448 --> 05:52:56.458 align:start position:0%
give The Independents a choice to
 
05:52:58.070 --> 05:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
participate because they haven't got
 
05:53:00.410 --> 05:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
that same large supply chain as you know
 
05:53:02.270 --> 05:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
CVS might have
 
05:53:04.190 --> 05:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
um again these are not compromises I
 
05:53:05.390 --> 05:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to make on this because we wanted
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
to keep the program big and robust but
 
05:53:11.030 --> 05:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
if we have to I would be willing to do
 
05:53:13.610 --> 05:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
that and knowing that the people I've
 
05:53:14.930 --> 05:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
been working with will be unhappy with
 
05:53:16.850 --> 05:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
me but knowing that it's something which
 
05:53:19.970 --> 05:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
is the art of compromise so again I
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
since I think we're so close with just
 
05:53:23.208 --> 05:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
that little bit of a language thing
 
05:53:25.850 --> 05:53:25.860 align:start position:0%
because that was the major glitch again
 
05:53:27.650 --> 05:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
answer to representative Merchant it
 
05:53:28.730 --> 05:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
isn't I agree it's not just
 
05:53:30.230 --> 05:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but they have the perfect
 
05:53:31.850 --> 05:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
choice to either participate or not they
 
05:53:33.410 --> 05:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
can keep things exactly as they
 
05:53:35.690 --> 05:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
currently are by being non-participating
 
05:53:37.970 --> 05:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
and the amendment a new amendment being
 
05:53:42.310 --> 05:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:44.930 --> 05:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
yes sir if pharmacist people
 
05:53:47.390 --> 05:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
representatives were willing
 
05:53:49.368 --> 05:53:49.378 align:start position:0%
would you do some all-nighters on this
 
05:53:51.410 --> 05:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
because it's got to get out the door on
 
05:53:54.948 --> 05:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
March 11th at the latest from uh Finance
 
05:53:54.958 --> 05:53:56.030 align:start position:0%
March 11th at the latest from uh Finance
three

05:53:56.030 --> 05:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:53:58.490 --> 05:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
oh yeah well I mean as I said we we met
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
a week ago well eight days ago I thought
 
05:54:03.410 --> 05:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
we had reached a conclusion because on
 
05:54:05.510 --> 05:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
the phone on the call the language I
 
05:54:07.670 --> 05:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
adopted a lot of it came from uh and
 
05:54:09.650 --> 05:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
fellows who was one of the pharmacy
 
05:54:11.510 --> 05:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
representatives for one of the chains
 
05:54:13.850 --> 05:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
and I thought that we had something we
 
05:54:15.230 --> 05:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
agreed on
 
05:54:17.448 --> 05:54:17.458 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately nobody got back to me
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't I submitted that
 
05:54:21.170 --> 05:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
Amendment as it was
 
05:54:23.330 --> 05:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and it just then I got information
 
05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
that people were still unhappy with it
 
05:54:27.048 --> 05:54:27.058 align:start position:0%
if we could negotiate in good faith
 
05:54:28.610 --> 05:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
where we just communicate back and forth
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
we can get that done and I think we
 
05:54:33.048 --> 05:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
really can I I guess I'm a big Optimist
 
05:54:35.208 --> 05:54:35.218 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but I'm an optimist
 
05:54:37.070 --> 05:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's the only way to survive is a spine
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
surgeon you got to be an optimist you
 
05:54:41.448 --> 05:54:41.458 align:start position:0%
know representative Merchant I was about
 
05:54:43.490 --> 05:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
to ask representative Solway what
 
05:54:46.730 --> 05:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
Solomon would do in a case like this
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
um or to quote somebody on a cop show
 
05:54:51.048 --> 05:54:51.058 align:start position:0%
ladies you're both pretty I love you
 
05:54:51.058 --> 05:54:52.310 align:start position:0%
ladies you're both pretty I love you
both

05:54:52.310 --> 05:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
both
 
05:54:54.230 --> 05:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
um do you
 
05:54:54.240 --> 05:54:55.930 align:start position:0%
um do you
do

05:54:55.930 --> 05:54:55.940 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:54:59.570 --> 05:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative merchant do you
 
05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
think that you with some Representatives
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
could do a an intensive work with
 
05:55:08.448 --> 05:55:08.458 align:start position:0%
representative canark and if at the end
 
05:55:12.288 --> 05:55:12.298 align:start position:0%
you can always say to finance division
 
05:55:14.990 --> 05:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
three kill this sucker right
 
05:55:17.330 --> 05:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
I think you could deliver some folks to
 
05:55:19.788 --> 05:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
this meeting let me ask you this
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman when I look at the
 
05:55:24.948 --> 05:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
calendar what are we looking at out the
 
05:55:28.010 --> 05:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
door today from this committee over to
 
05:55:31.490 --> 05:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
finance division three out their door no
 
05:55:33.530 --> 05:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
later than March 11th
 
05:55:35.930 --> 05:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
I I concern myself with it going to
 
05:55:37.970 --> 05:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
finance and working on it there because
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
the people in finance don't have the
 
05:55:42.350 --> 05:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
expertise and the knowledge
 
05:55:44.030 --> 05:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
um so I'm really kind of reluctant to
 
05:55:46.368 --> 05:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
let it go out of the committee this
 
05:55:47.930 --> 05:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
committee really is the one it's going
 
05:55:49.490 --> 05:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
out of the committee it will be going
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
out of the committee no matter how it
 
05:55:55.010 --> 05:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
goes out right unless we kill it I don't
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
want to kill the bill I'd rather
 
05:55:59.270 --> 05:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'd rather retain the bill and let us
 
05:56:00.830 --> 05:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
work on the bill and get all the parties
 
05:56:02.090 --> 05:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
around the table I think one of the
 
05:56:04.310 --> 05:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
things we talked about before is the
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
offer on the table to carve out
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacies at least temporarily for a
 
05:56:10.730 --> 05:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
year will we build on certain things was
 
05:56:13.730 --> 05:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
a fair thing to accomplish and at that
 
05:56:14.810 --> 05:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
point in time what I heard from
 
05:56:16.250 --> 05:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative canark in his
 
05:56:17.810 --> 05:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
conversation with the vaccine program
 
05:56:21.650 --> 05:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
that was not acceptable to them so uh
 
05:56:24.530 --> 05:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
now actually may I clarify no actually
 
05:56:26.208 --> 05:56:26.218 align:start position:0%
not true because it's going to be two
 
05:56:28.128 --> 05:56:28.138 align:start position:0%
years before this program would be stood
 
05:56:30.410 --> 05:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
up anyway there's going to be a lot of
 
05:56:32.150 --> 05:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
preliminary work
 
05:56:34.970 --> 05:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
um we can as we work in rules to begin
 
05:56:36.770 --> 05:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
with but we could even have time
 
05:56:38.570 --> 05:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
probably for another statutory bite at
 
05:56:40.368 --> 05:56:40.378 align:start position:0%
it next year but I don't really think we
 
05:56:42.230 --> 05:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
would need that I think the bottom line
 
05:56:45.410 --> 05:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
is you know Gary and I could you know we
 
05:56:48.350 --> 05:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
did work out of that Monday uh we can do
 
05:56:50.448 --> 05:56:50.458 align:start position:0%
we did have all the stakeholders I mean
 
05:56:52.070 --> 05:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
we don't need to process it in the
 
05:56:54.410 --> 05:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
committee as much as Gary and I got to
 
05:56:56.208 --> 05:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
get to work and and really get to work
 
05:56:58.250 --> 05:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
with these stakeholders and just get to
 
05:56:59.570 --> 05:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
the point where everybody can shake
 
05:57:01.010 --> 05:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
their hand and be well we don't do that
 
05:57:03.170 --> 05:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
in covet anymore shake their head on
 
05:57:06.410 --> 05:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
zoom and say okay we're good to go and
 
05:57:08.208 --> 05:57:08.218 align:start position:0%
then again if we can't we just have to
 
05:57:11.930 --> 05:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
say Okay this is no good and and uh not
 
05:57:14.270 --> 05:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
let it go I don't you know if we retain
 
05:57:15.770 --> 05:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
it it's not the end of the world it's
 
05:57:17.868 --> 05:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
just again we lost four million bucks
 
05:57:19.788 --> 05:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
last year because it died a covet death
 
05:57:21.708 --> 05:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
over in the Senate but uh because we
 
05:57:23.270 --> 05:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
passed it out of the house
 
05:57:25.128 --> 05:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
if we delay it again there's another
 
05:57:26.930 --> 05:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
four million bucks you know we got all
 
05:57:29.868 --> 05:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
excited in that uh in that recent uh
 
05:57:31.548 --> 05:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
thing where we're going to get 3.3
 
05:57:33.110 --> 05:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars over five years in that
 
05:57:35.390 --> 05:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
settlement about the opioid stuff well
 
05:57:37.730 --> 05:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
this is four million bucks a year
 
05:57:39.650 --> 05:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
um that's not chicken feed and I'd like
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
to just get this bill going I think we
 
05:57:44.090 --> 05:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
can get it I personally do all right I I
 
05:57:46.250 --> 05:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
would like to say that unless anybody
 
05:57:50.208 --> 05:57:50.218 align:start position:0%
really feel feels an existential need to
 
05:57:50.218 --> 05:57:50.990 align:start position:0%
really feel feels an existential need to
speak

05:57:50.990 --> 05:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:57:54.530 --> 05:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
we have the topic here either we vote
 
05:57:57.288 --> 05:57:57.298 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the bill up and over
 
05:58:00.530 --> 05:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
to finance three or we don't and if we
 
05:58:02.990 --> 05:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't then I believe we can look at
 
05:58:06.530 --> 05:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
another motion and I would really unless
 
05:58:09.830 --> 05:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
anybody can convince me
 
05:58:12.288 --> 05:58:12.298 align:start position:0%
um I would like to call a question
 
05:58:14.750 --> 05:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
and the the question actually is on the
 
05:58:14.760 --> 05:58:15.708 align:start position:0%
and the the question actually is on the
amendment

05:58:15.708 --> 05:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:58:19.190 --> 05:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh made by can Eric and super seconded
 
05:58:22.970 --> 05:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
by McKay for Amendment zero two three
 
05:58:26.810 --> 05:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
zero H and would the clerk please call
 
05:58:30.110 --> 05:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
the rule it and it is to accept the
 
05:58:33.410 --> 05:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
amendment so a Yes means accept the
 
05:58:37.250 --> 05:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
amendment of no means we don't

06:01:02.570 --> 06:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
H do we have a second second
 
06:01:06.230 --> 06:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
and Makai second okay now we can discuss
 
06:01:07.970 --> 06:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
but please let's not make it terribly
 
06:01:07.980 --> 06:01:10.128 align:start position:0%
but please let's not make it terribly
long

06:01:10.128 --> 06:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
long
 
06:01:12.110 --> 06:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
may I speak to the motion
 
06:01:13.730 --> 06:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
um you may
 
06:01:16.430 --> 06:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh speak to the motion yes and then
 
06:01:17.990 --> 06:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
represent much of what I was going to
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
say I've already said because I kind of
 
06:01:21.948 --> 06:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
moved it over to our discussion of the
 
06:01:24.590 --> 06:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
amendment so I just want to remind the
 
06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill then is really to
 
06:01:27.470 --> 06:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
expand our currently successful
 
06:01:29.570 --> 06:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
pediatric vaccine dog purchasing program
 
06:01:31.310 --> 06:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
to the adult population
 
06:01:33.288 --> 06:01:33.298 align:start position:0%
the bill enables the insurers to band
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
together so that they can both purchase
 
06:01:37.430 --> 06:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
the adult vaccines the only reason the
 
06:01:40.190 --> 06:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS has to get involved is to allow the
 
06:01:42.530 --> 06:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
insurers to access the very low cost
 
06:01:44.270 --> 06:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
federally discounted rate through the
 
06:01:44.280 --> 06:01:45.288 align:start position:0%
federally discounted rate through the
CDC

06:01:45.288 --> 06:01:45.298 align:start position:0%
CDC
 
06:01:46.670 --> 06:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
because that's only available to
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
governmental units to remind you the
 
06:01:50.090 --> 06:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
Pediatric program has worked well for
 
06:01:51.890 --> 06:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
over 15 years allowing us to purchase
 
06:01:53.930 --> 06:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
annually 38 million dollars of vaccines
 
06:01:56.208 --> 06:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
for 28 million for a savings of 10
 
06:01:57.650 --> 06:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually
 
06:01:59.208 --> 06:01:59.218 align:start position:0%
and the study by New Hampshire insurance
 
06:02:01.190 --> 06:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
department about the extension just for
 
06:02:03.170 --> 06:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
the adults showed that the expanded
 
06:02:05.090 --> 06:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
adults will save an additional 4 million
 
06:02:07.310 --> 06:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
dollars over the claims paid costs of
 
06:02:09.590 --> 06:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines for that group in addition to
 
06:02:10.970 --> 06:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
saving money it will help Finance
 
06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines to the uninsured
 
06:02:15.230 --> 06:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
now the extension of this program is
 
06:02:16.970 --> 06:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
actually Revenue neutral when you look
 
06:02:18.288 --> 06:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal note it looks like it's
 
06:02:20.930 --> 06:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
going to cost 366 thousand dollars but
 
06:02:22.610 --> 06:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's red for new neutral because all
 
06:02:24.288 --> 06:02:24.298 align:start position:0%
those administrative costs are recovered
 
06:02:26.090 --> 06:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
dollar for dollar in the assessment on
 
06:02:28.490 --> 06:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
the insurers to fully cover the cost to
 
06:02:29.628 --> 06:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
the program
 
06:02:31.610 --> 06:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
the overall Bill itself is actually
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
Revenue positive for the state because
 
06:02:36.288 --> 06:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
as part of getting the insurers to come
 
06:02:39.110 --> 06:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
on board for this they have agreed to
 
06:02:41.208 --> 06:02:41.218 align:start position:0%
absorb the assessment for the
 
06:02:42.830 --> 06:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for the Pediatric
 
06:02:42.840 --> 06:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for the Pediatric
program

06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:02:45.650 --> 06:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
which were left out in the Pediatric
 
06:02:47.510 --> 06:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
Bill and that's about a half million
 
06:02:49.368 --> 06:02:49.378 align:start position:0%
dollars a year so what we end up getting
 
06:02:52.310 --> 06:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
is a savings to the state's budget of
 
06:02:53.628 --> 06:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars a year
 
06:02:56.990 --> 06:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
because those dhh costs get absorbed by
 
06:02:59.990 --> 06:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
the insurers and and they in so doing we
 
06:03:01.490 --> 06:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
get the four million dollars of savings
 
06:03:03.830 --> 06:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
on the vaccines now the important thing
 
06:03:05.628 --> 06:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
you realize is the the insurers don't
 
06:03:07.070 --> 06:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
get to pocket that money it doesn't go
 
06:03:09.048 --> 06:03:09.058 align:start position:0%
to their bottom line because insurers
 
06:03:10.910 --> 06:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
are required by the medical loss ratio
 
06:03:13.310 --> 06:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
calculations to continue to spend a
 
06:03:15.048 --> 06:03:15.058 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of their premiums on
 
06:03:17.330 --> 06:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
Medical Care the reduction in vaccine
 
06:03:20.030 --> 06:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
costs which are medical costs will lead
 
06:03:22.010 --> 06:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
to either premium reductions which is of
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
course never likely or more likely lower
 
06:03:26.750 --> 06:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
premium increases in the future in order
 
06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
to maintain that medical loss ratio and
 
06:03:32.208 --> 06:03:32.218 align:start position:0%
I do need before voting to clarify a few
 
06:03:34.010 --> 06:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
non-factual statements that came up in
 
06:03:36.350 --> 06:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing and subsequent there was
 
06:03:37.970 --> 06:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
confusion during the testimony on the
 
06:03:40.490 --> 06:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
bill regarding the savings calculated by
 
06:03:43.850 --> 06:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
06:03:45.350 --> 06:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
a statement was made that that was a
 
06:03:46.850 --> 06:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
comparison between the list price and
 
06:03:48.708 --> 06:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
the federal discount rate that is not
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
true I sent it out to you again so you
 
06:03:52.368 --> 06:03:52.378 align:start position:0%
could look at it and Tyler Brandon send
 
06:03:54.890 --> 06:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
it to you as well it's the difference
 
06:03:58.010 --> 06:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
between the actual claims paid by the
 
06:03:59.448 --> 06:03:59.458 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
06:04:00.948 --> 06:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
in other words it's already their
 
06:04:02.930 --> 06:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
discounted rate and the federally
 
06:04:04.368 --> 06:04:04.378 align:start position:0%
discounted rate so the four million
 
06:04:06.410 --> 06:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
dollars are real savings and to remember
 
06:04:08.690 --> 06:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
this bill does not mandate vaccines it
 
06:04:11.208 --> 06:04:11.218 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the decision to
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinate that's between the patient and
 
06:04:15.948 --> 06:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
provider it's only about paying uh we
 
06:04:16.850 --> 06:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
already talked about some of those
 
06:04:18.350 --> 06:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies from the letter that we got
 
06:04:20.448 --> 06:04:20.458 align:start position:0%
a day or two ago
 
06:04:22.670 --> 06:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
um and so I don't I'm just kind of
 
06:04:24.470 --> 06:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
scanning down what I made a list of
 
06:04:26.930 --> 06:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
things I think I covered most all of
 
06:04:26.940 --> 06:04:28.128 align:start position:0%
things I think I covered most all of
those

06:04:28.128 --> 06:04:28.138 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
um yes I did cover all those again
 
06:04:32.090 --> 06:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
basically we can move the vaccines as
 
06:04:34.128 --> 06:04:34.138 align:start position:0%
needed to handle shortages the
 
06:04:36.948 --> 06:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
requirements for storage are the state
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
of the art
 
06:04:42.170 --> 06:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
um and again if we do decide to move on
 
06:04:43.670 --> 06:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
first of all it's already voluntary
 
06:04:45.430 --> 06:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
according to the amendment we just
 
06:04:48.170 --> 06:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
passed but if we want to make it even
 
06:04:50.448 --> 06:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
clearer and cleaner that the pharmacists
 
06:04:52.910 --> 06:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
are carved out we can do that and still
 
06:04:55.610 --> 06:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
keep the retrospective assessment uh and
 
06:04:57.410 --> 06:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to work continue to
 
06:05:00.890 --> 06:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
work on that so again bottom line we
 
06:05:02.750 --> 06:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
lost four million bucks last year due to
 
06:05:05.090 --> 06:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
covid killing the bill if we retain it
 
06:05:06.650 --> 06:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
we lose another four million dollars
 
06:05:08.930 --> 06:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
obviously if we itl we lose formula
 
06:05:11.830 --> 06:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
dollars in perpetuity any case but
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
the hell uh DHHS nhva American health
 
06:05:19.490 --> 06:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
insurance plans New Futures and I really
 
06:05:21.650 --> 06:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
I will solidly commit that we will
 
06:05:23.448 --> 06:05:23.458 align:start position:0%
continue to work with representative
 
06:05:25.490 --> 06:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
Merchant and the other pharmacists to
 
06:05:27.170 --> 06:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
negotiate the degree in terms of the
 
06:05:29.390 --> 06:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacy's participation as we go in the
 
06:05:31.490 --> 06:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
other committees and I really do believe
 
06:05:33.948 --> 06:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
we'll reach an agreement um but I guess
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a Pollyanna
 
06:05:38.030 --> 06:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and because we often bring forth
 
06:05:39.530 --> 06:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
amendments to bills does it goes through
 
06:05:41.090 --> 06:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
subsequent committees that's not an
 
06:05:43.250 --> 06:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
unusual thing and again there's plenty
 
06:05:44.510 --> 06:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
of time because this would not even be
 
06:05:47.510 --> 06:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
operational until 2023 uh with rule
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
making and even more statutory work of
 
06:05:52.970 --> 06:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
need to so I just urge you to vote this
 
06:05:55.190 --> 06:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
bill ocpa
 
06:05:57.048 --> 06:05:57.058 align:start position:0%
to move it out to the second committee
 
06:05:58.850 --> 06:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
well we continue to fine-tune the
 
06:06:00.288 --> 06:06:00.298 align:start position:0%
language and make that progress toward
 
06:06:02.270 --> 06:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
annually saving four million dollars for
 
06:06:04.070 --> 06:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
insurers and five hundred thousand
 
06:06:05.868 --> 06:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
dollars for the state rather than delay
 
06:06:07.730 --> 06:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
for another year we really have plenty
 
06:06:08.510 --> 06:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
of time
 
06:06:10.368 --> 06:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
thank you representative knurk the chair
 
06:06:13.490 --> 06:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
called son representative Shapiro
 
06:06:15.708 --> 06:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:06:15.718 --> 06:06:16.610 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

06:06:16.610 --> 06:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
I don't have much to say but I will say
 
06:06:21.708 --> 06:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
that for so many years I've heard so
 
06:06:23.810 --> 06:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
many of us talk about our frustration
 
06:06:26.990 --> 06:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
with lowering health care costs relative
 
06:06:28.910 --> 06:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the effectiveness of our Health Care
 
06:06:33.230 --> 06:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
system and people blame each other and
 
06:06:33.240 --> 06:06:34.128 align:start position:0%
system and people blame each other and
um

06:06:34.128 --> 06:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:36.288 --> 06:06:36.298 align:start position:0%
people have different
 
06:06:38.868 --> 06:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
um ideological points of view but
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
nevertheless there's just it seems
 
06:06:40.798 --> 06:06:42.110 align:start position:0%
nevertheless there's just it seems
intractable

06:06:42.110 --> 06:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
intractable
 
06:06:44.090 --> 06:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
um endless frustration about health care
 
06:06:44.100 --> 06:06:45.590 align:start position:0%
um endless frustration about health care
costs

06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
costs
 
06:06:47.390 --> 06:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
um and I would say that after this
 
06:06:49.970 --> 06:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
afternoon I understand why
 
06:06:49.980 --> 06:06:52.330 align:start position:0%
afternoon I understand why
um

06:06:52.330 --> 06:06:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:55.670 --> 06:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
so I am going to cast my vote
 
06:06:59.150 --> 06:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
um to save a few dollars in health care
 
06:07:02.990 --> 06:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
costs and put my faith in the optimism
 
06:07:05.330 --> 06:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
of Representative knurk that an
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
agreement can be reached and this can
 
06:07:10.310 --> 06:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually happen and we can save two to
 
06:07:13.010 --> 06:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
four million dollars in this next year
 
06:07:16.070 --> 06:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Folsom
 
06:07:18.708 --> 06:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
um yes just a clarification I did not
 
06:07:21.970 --> 06:07:21.980 align:start position:0%
get who was the second on the amendment
 
06:07:26.288 --> 06:07:26.298 align:start position:0%
McKay and I just finished Mackay but
 
06:07:29.570 --> 06:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I know you're talking about and uh
 
06:07:31.548 --> 06:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
I did not
 
06:07:34.250 --> 06:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
um have a second on
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment I know representative
 
06:07:39.770 --> 06:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
knurk made the motion but I don't
 
06:07:43.010 --> 06:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
remember hearing it also also it was
 
06:07:49.070 --> 06:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:52.670 --> 06:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
plus Jerry we know where you live
 
06:07:55.190 --> 06:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
and if you are not doing full complete
 
06:07:57.948 --> 06:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
due diligence to help we're coming for
 
06:07:58.788 --> 06:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
you brother
 
06:08:01.548 --> 06:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
no problem I I you know as soon as I say
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
Gary and I we have been friends for four
 
06:08:07.610 --> 06:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
years we will work on this and I know I
 
06:08:09.350 --> 06:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
will make some of the people on the that
 
06:08:12.110 --> 06:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
I on the other side unhappy because uh I
 
06:08:13.910 --> 06:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to make this come to fruition even
 
06:08:15.890 --> 06:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
if we only get 66 percent
 
06:08:20.150 --> 06:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes you will representative Merchant
 
06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:08:22.798 --> 06:08:23.448 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

06:08:23.448 --> 06:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:26.030 --> 06:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to the amendment it's it does
 
06:08:27.890 --> 06:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
go in the right direction although it
 
06:08:29.868 --> 06:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to where things I think have
 
06:08:31.190 --> 06:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
to get to
 
06:08:34.310 --> 06:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
I would say this I've heard from pvm's
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
time and time again how much money
 
06:08:39.288 --> 06:08:39.298 align:start position:0%
they're saving the healthcare industry I
 
06:08:42.530 --> 06:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
have yet to see my premiums on my drug
 
06:08:45.470 --> 06:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
benefits no matter how much money they
 
06:08:47.090 --> 06:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
get back from manufacturers and rebates
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
so if you think I'm a little bit jaded
 
06:08:52.250 --> 06:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
and pessimistic about not being quite as
 
06:08:54.830 --> 06:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
optimistic as my colleague
 
06:08:54.840 --> 06:08:55.548 align:start position:0%
optimistic as my colleague
um

06:08:55.548 --> 06:08:55.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:57.650 --> 06:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's where I am because in this
 
06:08:59.690 --> 06:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
industry everyone talks about how
 
06:09:00.948 --> 06:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to bring down the cost of
 
06:09:04.310 --> 06:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
Health Care I have yet to see it happen
 
06:09:06.410 --> 06:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
um so that's part of my concern number
 
06:09:08.930 --> 06:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
two this bill doesn't take
 
06:09:12.530 --> 06:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
into effect until 2023. so therefore if
 
06:09:15.708 --> 06:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
you delay it a year on retaining it we
 
06:09:17.990 --> 06:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
haven't really delayed it so we could
 
06:09:21.048 --> 06:09:21.058 align:start position:0%
work on this bill over the time still
 
06:09:24.110 --> 06:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
have it effective date on 2023 without
 
06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
losing any Steam on the dollars we're
 
06:09:29.390 --> 06:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
trying to save that's there and if I
 
06:09:31.610 --> 06:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
know the pharmacy Community has Grave
 
06:09:33.288 --> 06:09:33.298 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill
 
06:09:36.350 --> 06:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
and they have become a major player in
 
06:09:39.410 --> 06:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
giving vaccinations to patients when I
 
06:09:42.170 --> 06:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
then hit the big yellow caution button
 
06:09:44.270 --> 06:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
put my foot on the brake and take my
 
06:09:47.150 --> 06:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
foot off the gas and give the parties a
 
06:09:49.490 --> 06:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
fair time and not work under the gun to
 
06:09:52.010 --> 06:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
work and Hammer out something that's
 
06:09:54.288 --> 06:09:54.298 align:start position:0%
works for everybody in a reasonable
 
06:09:56.990 --> 06:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
period of time not trying to do it under
 
06:09:59.570 --> 06:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
the pressure we're all under today and
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
make something work so my recommendation
 
06:10:04.128 --> 06:10:04.138 align:start position:0%
of the committee is to not vote for the
 
06:10:06.708 --> 06:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
bill even though it's been amended and
 
06:10:08.930 --> 06:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
again to go back into retain it and let
 
06:10:10.610 --> 06:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
the parties come together
 
06:10:12.890 --> 06:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable period of time logically
 
06:10:14.990 --> 06:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
and thoughtfully figuring out how to
 
06:10:16.510 --> 06:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
make this thing work
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
representative clarification
 
06:10:20.448 --> 06:10:20.458 align:start position:0%
just because it's a point of information
 
06:10:22.490 --> 06:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
issue about that it's got to be really
 
06:10:24.770 --> 06:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
brief it is the effective date is
 
06:10:27.128 --> 06:10:27.138 align:start position:0%
actually when it's passed
 
06:10:30.770 --> 06:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
no it's it's upon Passage the reason for
 
06:10:32.390 --> 06:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
that is that allows them to start the
 
06:10:35.208 --> 06:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
setup um if the effect takes the ACT
 
06:10:37.490 --> 06:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
takes effect upon passage the idea is
 
06:10:40.250 --> 06:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
that allows them to start setting it up
 
06:10:42.830 --> 06:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
the bill was 2022 the amendment makes it
 
06:10:45.948 --> 06:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
upon passage that was modeled after how
 
06:10:47.208 --> 06:10:47.218 align:start position:0%
things went for example with the
 
06:10:49.368 --> 06:10:49.378 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program we passed
 
06:10:52.010 --> 06:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
that in 2013 but it was not until 2016
 
06:10:54.410 --> 06:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
that all the pieces were in place this
 
06:10:56.330 --> 06:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
requires a number of things that have to
 
06:10:57.830 --> 06:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
be done on the stepwise sequential
 
06:11:00.048 --> 06:11:00.058 align:start position:0%
fashion so we with the drafting attorney
 
06:11:01.610 --> 06:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
we said effective immediately which
 
06:11:04.128 --> 06:11:04.138 align:start position:0%
enables DHHS and nhba to start their
 
06:11:06.948 --> 06:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
work but the issue is that they have to
 
06:11:10.430 --> 06:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
first enroll people that's the DHHS part
 
06:11:13.850 --> 06:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
then the nhva has to make the assessment
 
06:11:15.470 --> 06:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
which occurs in the spring they gathered
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
up by June then they pay it off to DHHS
 
06:11:20.208 --> 06:11:20.218 align:start position:0%
who then goes to purchase the vaccines
 
06:11:22.610 --> 06:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
which are for the next year so the the
 
06:11:24.948 --> 06:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
reason I say keep saying 223 is that's
 
06:11:26.810 --> 06:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
not the effective date it's simply
 
06:11:28.368 --> 06:11:28.378 align:start position:0%
that's how long it will take if we pass
 
06:11:30.890 --> 06:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
it in 2021 before the program is
 
06:11:33.890 --> 06:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
functional so if we do retain it it will
 
06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
move it back to 2024. so it it really
 
06:11:38.090 --> 06:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
will move it a year so sorry about that
 
06:11:39.770 --> 06:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to be clear that where
 
06:11:41.110 --> 06:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
those numbers come come from
 
06:11:43.490 --> 06:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative Canuck and representative
 
06:11:45.770 --> 06:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
Merchant one will write the positive

who is going to be whom we will see in a

few minutes but first we call on
 
06:11:55.730 --> 06:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
representative March
 
06:11:58.610 --> 06:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody I have to say that I
 
06:12:01.490 --> 06:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
have found this debate confusing uh it
 
06:12:03.048 --> 06:12:03.058 align:start position:0%
is not clear to me whether we're going
 
06:12:04.970 --> 06:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
to actually save money for patients in
 
06:12:06.890 --> 06:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it is not
 
06:12:08.750 --> 06:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
clear to me whether we may save the
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
department money and then offset that
 
06:12:13.310 --> 06:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
with higher health insurance costs uh it
 
06:12:15.350 --> 06:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
is distinctly unclear but I can say one
 
06:12:17.448 --> 06:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
thing for certain I'm not in the habit
 
06:12:19.010 --> 06:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
of voting bills out of this committee
 
06:12:21.288 --> 06:12:21.298 align:start position:0%
until we feel like we have a good bill
 
06:12:23.150 --> 06:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
we have a reputation for passing really
 
06:12:25.250 --> 06:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
good bills out of this committee and at
 
06:12:27.048 --> 06:12:27.058 align:start position:0%
this point in time I'm afraid that I am
 
06:12:28.490 --> 06:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
not convinced that we're having a good
 
06:12:30.470 --> 06:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
product to the next committee and I
 
06:12:32.750 --> 06:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to basically expect them to
 
06:12:35.708 --> 06:12:35.718 align:start position:0%
fix our problems for us

06:23:49.368 --> 06:23:49.378 align:start position:0%
I really can't hear us because we have
 
06:23:50.930 --> 06:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
his headsets on
 
06:23:52.610 --> 06:23:52.620 align:start position:0%

06:24:08.470 --> 06:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:12.650 --> 06:24:12.660 align:start position:0%

06:24:14.150 --> 06:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
are next to each other we can't hug each
 
06:24:19.090 --> 06:24:19.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:21.650 --> 06:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
no elbows either
 
06:24:24.110 --> 06:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
I know
 
06:24:25.910 --> 06:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
I guess you don't miss sitting next to
 
06:24:28.548 --> 06:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
me anymore Jerry oh yes I do because we
 
06:24:30.368 --> 06:24:30.378 align:start position:0%
had a hell of a good time
 
06:24:34.080 --> 06:24:34.090 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:34.090 --> 06:24:54.890 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

06:24:54.890 --> 06:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:57.590 --> 06:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know when I was in radio one of the
 
06:24:59.330 --> 06:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
first things they banged into our head
 
06:25:03.770 --> 06:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
is every mic is a live mic
 
06:25:06.110 --> 06:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
and every one of my teachers had some
 
06:25:07.788 --> 06:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
horror stories as to how they learned
 
06:25:15.410 --> 06:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:15.420 --> 06:27:11.208 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:27:11.208 --> 06:27:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:14.570 --> 06:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
while we are waiting to 3 30 hour to
 
06:27:18.910 --> 06:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
arrive we will be meeting next Tuesday
 
06:27:22.850 --> 06:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
not Monday next Tuesday and I should
 
06:27:25.730 --> 06:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
have sent you a list of the bills we
 
06:27:28.910 --> 06:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
will be having hearings on and some of
 
06:27:33.170 --> 06:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
the ones I hope we might be able to exec
 
06:27:35.330 --> 06:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
so that's next Tuesday
 
06:27:38.270 --> 06:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a busy week Tuesday
 
06:27:41.270 --> 06:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
for us and then Wednesday Thursday for
 
06:27:43.910 --> 06:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
the entire house
 
06:27:48.048 --> 06:27:48.058 align:start position:0%
but we're up to it so there it is
 
06:27:53.330 --> 06:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:56.208 --> 06:27:56.218 align:start position:0%
I promise 3 30. well Mark that's why
 
06:27:57.770 --> 06:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
they pay us the big bucks so we can get
 
06:28:01.128 --> 06:28:01.138 align:start position:0%
all this stuff done yeah
 
06:28:04.128 --> 06:28:04.138 align:start position:0%
Thursday is a normal week exactly yes
 
06:28:04.138 --> 06:28:04.810 align:start position:0%
Thursday is a normal week exactly yes
yes

06:28:04.810 --> 06:28:04.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:28:07.730 --> 06:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
although we normally start at 10 rather
 
06:28:10.850 --> 06:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
than nine but that is a normal week we
 
06:28:13.128 --> 06:28:13.138 align:start position:0%
usually have either two committee days
 
06:28:15.230 --> 06:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
in one session day or two session days
 
06:28:17.750 --> 06:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
and one committee day depending on how
 
06:28:20.830 --> 06:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
close we are to a deadline so it's not
 
06:28:24.410 --> 06:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
unimaginable it's the other zooms that
 
06:28:27.770 --> 06:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
all of us have endlessly that then make
 
06:28:30.530 --> 06:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
our weeks seem far longer and the other
 
06:28:34.128 --> 06:28:34.138 align:start position:0%
thing that I notice is that
 
06:28:34.138 --> 06:28:34.730 align:start position:0%
thing that I notice is that
um

06:28:34.730 --> 06:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:37.250 --> 06:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
we used to have an actual Rhythm to the
 
06:28:41.990 --> 06:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
week because you did here exec on
 
06:28:44.750 --> 06:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
Tuesday reports on Wednesday scheduling
 
06:28:47.448 --> 06:28:47.458 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday session on Thursday and
 
06:28:50.570 --> 06:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
repeat next week uh now there really
 
06:28:52.730 --> 06:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
isn't any rhythm to anything we just
 
06:28:55.610 --> 06:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
have zoom meetings all the time so and I
 
06:28:58.190 --> 06:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
find that infinitely more exhausting and
 
06:29:02.330 --> 06:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh I can't appreciate the kindness of
 
06:29:04.570 --> 06:29:04.580 align:start position:0%
all of everybody
 
06:29:07.190 --> 06:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh recognizing the difficulties that
 
06:29:08.930 --> 06:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
everybody else is working under I
 
06:29:11.330 --> 06:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate that very well it looks like
 
06:29:14.270 --> 06:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
we will only have to have one meeting in
 
06:29:16.788 --> 06:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
March uh first week of March and one
 
06:29:19.730 --> 06:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
meeting in the week before the 11th
 
06:29:21.770 --> 06:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
um we're moving things along fairly well
 
06:29:24.110 --> 06:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
everybody's you know everybody's had
 
06:29:26.930 --> 06:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
their say but they're not taking too
 
06:29:30.170 --> 06:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
much time and so I don't think one of
 
06:29:32.150 --> 06:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
those weeks we will need to meet twice
 
06:29:34.788 --> 06:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
so let's let's keep at this
 
06:29:39.110 --> 06:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
well now I open the exact session on
 
06:29:42.948 --> 06:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
House Bill 246 establishing a protective
 
06:29:47.750 --> 06:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
order for vulnerable adults introduced
 
06:29:51.708 --> 06:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
to us by representative Renee Cushing
 
06:29:54.650 --> 06:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
and the chair calls on representative
 
06:30:07.368 --> 06:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:07.378 --> 06:30:10.430 align:start position:0%
 
unmute

06:30:10.430 --> 06:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:14.030 --> 06:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
I can't see him on the screen anywhere
 
06:30:16.610 --> 06:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
sorry about that there we are it's okay
 
06:30:19.250 --> 06:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative king for a motion that
 
06:30:22.810 --> 06:30:22.820 align:start position:0%
was a good practice run it was
 
06:30:26.510 --> 06:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh similar to what
 
06:30:30.590 --> 06:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh said on hb604 I'd
 
06:30:32.330 --> 06:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
like to see good bills come out of our
 
06:30:35.030 --> 06:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee and as much as I'd like to see
 
06:30:38.390 --> 06:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
the elderly protected I just don't think
 
06:30:42.170 --> 06:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh HP 246 is going to be that bill so
 
06:30:45.890 --> 06:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
I'd like the motion that we move HB 246
 
06:30:47.510 --> 06:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
to Ito
 
06:30:47.520 --> 06:30:49.730 align:start position:0%
to Ito
and

06:30:49.730 --> 06:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:30:52.270 --> 06:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
someone had asked me representative
 
06:30:55.128 --> 06:30:55.138 align:start position:0%
Betty gay had asked if she could second
 
06:30:58.070 --> 06:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
that and if you still would like to you
 
06:31:01.430 --> 06:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:04.788 --> 06:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
I second the motion thank you now we may
 
06:31:08.090 --> 06:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:10.730 --> 06:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
and representative King because you made
 
06:31:13.128 --> 06:31:13.138 align:start position:0%
the motion you may continue to discuss
 
06:31:15.350 --> 06:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
it if you wish
 
06:31:19.788 --> 06:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
yes this this bill in in my opinion is
 
06:31:19.798 --> 06:31:20.690 align:start position:0%
yes this this bill in in my opinion is
um

06:31:20.690 --> 06:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:23.030 --> 06:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's missing a few
 
06:31:26.470 --> 06:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh I I think the language is just um
 
06:31:29.570 --> 06:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's it's lacking a lot and the biggest
 
06:31:33.890 --> 06:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
one is really the due process part and
 
06:31:37.548 --> 06:31:37.558 align:start position:0%
um and I think somebody that's that is
 
06:31:40.368 --> 06:31:40.378 align:start position:0%
wrongly accused could go a long way down
 
06:31:42.708 --> 06:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
the road of having possessions taken
 
06:31:45.830 --> 06:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
away from them and as some people have
 
06:31:47.868 --> 06:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned Firearms would be some of
 
06:31:49.788 --> 06:31:49.798 align:start position:0%
those possessions
 
06:31:52.430 --> 06:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
um and there's really no recourse for
 
06:31:55.368 --> 06:31:55.378 align:start position:0%
that person that's wrongly accused so I
 
06:31:58.010 --> 06:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
really think that this bill needs to
 
06:32:01.070 --> 06:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
really do a better job with identifying
 
06:32:03.350 --> 06:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
due process
 
06:32:11.810 --> 06:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:13.250 --> 06:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:32:13.260 --> 06:32:15.948 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:32:15.948 --> 06:32:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:18.350 --> 06:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:32:21.708 --> 06:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
and I'm incredibly saddened by this bill
 
06:32:23.690 --> 06:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
because it has had an enormous amount of
 
06:32:23.700 --> 06:32:24.410 align:start position:0%
because it has had an enormous amount of
work

06:32:24.410 --> 06:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:32:26.810 --> 06:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
from an enormous amount of people
 
06:32:31.430 --> 06:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the intent and the effect
 
06:32:34.970 --> 06:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
would have been to protect people who
 
06:32:38.090 --> 06:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
are desperately in need of protection
 
06:32:38.100 --> 06:32:39.470 align:start position:0%
are desperately in need of protection
and

06:32:39.470 --> 06:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:32:42.770 --> 06:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
there due process protections that are
 
06:32:44.270 --> 06:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
06:32:46.910 --> 06:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
comport with due processes we already
 
06:32:48.410 --> 06:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
know it
 
06:32:51.048 --> 06:32:51.058 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
06:32:53.708 --> 06:32:53.718 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
06:32:58.750 --> 06:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.330 --> 06:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
that somebody might have a firearm
 
06:33:02.340 --> 06:33:04.030 align:start position:0%
that somebody might have a firearm
removed

06:33:04.030 --> 06:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
removed
 
06:33:06.708 --> 06:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
inappropriately can be rectified very
 
06:33:06.718 --> 06:33:08.208 align:start position:0%
inappropriately can be rectified very
quickly

06:33:08.208 --> 06:33:08.218 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
06:33:10.750 --> 06:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
the very
 
06:33:14.390 --> 06:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
real and and and let me say that those
 
06:33:17.030 --> 06:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
people are not people who are actually
 
06:33:19.670 --> 06:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
in this proceeding being accused of a
 
06:33:23.628 --> 06:33:23.638 align:start position:0%
criminal event so uh they're not accused
 
06:33:26.510 --> 06:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're there are allegations but this
 
06:33:28.128 --> 06:33:28.138 align:start position:0%
is a civil proceeding it's not a
 
06:33:29.690 --> 06:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding
 
06:33:33.470 --> 06:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
but what I really want to say is that
 
06:33:36.590 --> 06:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of misinformation and
 
06:33:38.570 --> 06:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering that has been generated
 
06:33:40.510 --> 06:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
06:33:43.850 --> 06:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
really really saddens me because the
 
06:33:47.030 --> 06:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
effect is that vulnerable adults who are
 
06:33:49.010 --> 06:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
being ripped off
 
06:33:51.410 --> 06:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
or exploited
 
06:33:53.990 --> 06:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
or harmed
 
06:33:59.150 --> 06:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
is very real and the the
 
06:33:59.160 --> 06:34:00.650 align:start position:0%
is very real and the the
um

06:34:00.650 --> 06:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:00.660 --> 06:34:02.650 align:start position:0%
um
means

06:34:02.650 --> 06:34:02.660 align:start position:0%
means
 
06:34:06.770 --> 06:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
to quickly resolve that from them are in
 
06:34:10.310 --> 06:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill and they will go on suffering
 
06:34:13.970 --> 06:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
and yeah a couple of people who may have
 
06:34:13.980 --> 06:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
and yeah a couple of people who may have
been

06:34:16.310 --> 06:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:34:19.070 --> 06:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:21.650 --> 06:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
I think I'll just leave it there they
 
06:34:26.270 --> 06:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
will continue to suffer and a very small
 
06:34:26.280 --> 06:34:27.948 align:start position:0%
will continue to suffer and a very small
theoretical

06:34:27.948 --> 06:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
theoretical
 
06:34:27.958 --> 06:34:29.930 align:start position:0%
theoretical
potential

06:34:29.930 --> 06:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
potential
 
06:34:33.350 --> 06:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
section of the population
 
06:34:33.360 --> 06:34:35.090 align:start position:0%
section of the population
um

06:34:35.090 --> 06:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:38.270 --> 06:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
has triumphed over a very large segment
 
06:34:40.250 --> 06:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
of needy people and I think that's wrong
 
06:34:42.590 --> 06:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
06:34:49.090 --> 06:34:49.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:51.770 --> 06:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
look at how he's really learning how to
 
06:34:53.448 --> 06:34:53.458 align:start position:0%
do that isn't that great well the
 
06:34:55.430 --> 06:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
buttons don't cooperate with me I
 
06:34:57.530 --> 06:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
apologize for that oh you got it that
 
06:34:58.990 --> 06:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
time you nailed it
 
06:35:02.628 --> 06:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm I I shared
 
06:35:04.548 --> 06:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
representative webin I mean I do
 
06:35:06.288 --> 06:35:06.298 align:start position:0%
understand that some people are
 
06:35:08.150 --> 06:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about due process but really
 
06:35:10.190 --> 06:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
all the due process arguments I've heard
 
06:35:12.708 --> 06:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
about is the ability to confiscate
 
06:35:15.350 --> 06:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
Firearms or limited access to firearms
 
06:35:17.270 --> 06:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
and really when you look at the number
 
06:35:19.970 --> 06:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
of Elders that are really impacted by
 
06:35:21.410 --> 06:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
somebody threatening them with a gun
 
06:35:24.590 --> 06:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's rather low it's realistic and the
 
06:35:26.628 --> 06:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
consequences could be very serious but
 
06:35:28.190 --> 06:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of things that will be
 
06:35:30.190 --> 06:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
dealt with under this is the financial
 
06:35:33.948 --> 06:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
exploitation The Taking of property the
 
06:35:36.708 --> 06:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
misuse of property the transferring of
 
06:35:38.930 --> 06:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
property selling cars on people are
 
06:35:42.530 --> 06:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
doing that sort of thing and neglect is
 
06:35:44.150 --> 06:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest form of abuse where people
 
06:35:46.730 --> 06:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
just aren't properly cared for instead a
 
06:35:50.030 --> 06:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
left very unenchanitary situations none
 
06:35:52.730 --> 06:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
of which is in any way probably impacted
 
06:35:54.890 --> 06:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
by the possession of firearms in any way
 
06:35:58.970 --> 06:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
so I I sent out a proposed amendment to
 
06:36:01.310 --> 06:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
this to all the members of the committee
 
06:36:04.490 --> 06:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh on the 7th of February and I'd like
 
06:36:06.170 --> 06:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
you just to consider this to see if this
 
06:36:09.708 --> 06:36:09.718 align:start position:0%
is a protective action if we said
 
06:36:14.990 --> 06:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
on deaf on page uh uh two line 19 and
 
06:36:15.000 --> 06:36:17.510 align:start position:0%
on deaf on page uh uh two line 19 and
20.

06:36:17.510 --> 06:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:24.708 --> 06:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:27.590 --> 06:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
if we made this statement any protective
 
06:36:30.470 --> 06:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
action taken under this statute protect
 
06:36:32.690 --> 06:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
seniors and vulnerable adults for abuse
 
06:36:35.750 --> 06:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
neglect or exploitation shall not
 
06:36:38.030 --> 06:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
included audit the confiscate or limit
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
access to firearms for a person named in
 
06:36:41.930 --> 06:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
the complaint
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
now I don't like that because I don't
 
06:36:46.910 --> 06:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
think it's really a gun grab bill but
 
06:36:48.770 --> 06:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
this at least eliminates any possibility
 
06:36:51.288 --> 06:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
of people calling it a gun grab Bill and
 
06:36:52.970 --> 06:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
would still give us a course of action
 
06:36:55.368 --> 06:36:55.378 align:start position:0%
in the majority of cases to take some
 
06:36:57.830 --> 06:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
action protect very vulnerable people
 
06:37:00.730 --> 06:37:00.740 align:start position:0%
early not just the elderly too but the
 
06:37:02.570 --> 06:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
individuals with developmental
 
06:37:04.010 --> 06:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
disabilities and others that are often
 
06:37:07.190 --> 06:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
get taken very great advantages
 
06:37:08.930 --> 06:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how people feel about
 
06:37:10.490 --> 06:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
that I wish we could pass it without
 
06:37:14.150 --> 06:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
saying that but we tried to remove every
 
06:37:17.030 --> 06:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
mention of firearms in the last bill
 
06:37:19.730 --> 06:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't good enough because at
 
06:37:22.548 --> 06:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
least one of the representatives who is
 
06:37:26.048 --> 06:37:26.058 align:start position:0%
a child a member of the grabs the gun
 
06:37:29.030 --> 06:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
lobby said that because it comes under
 
06:37:30.830 --> 06:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the district court
 
06:37:33.948 --> 06:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
that Court person could still confiscate
 
06:37:33.958 --> 06:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
that Court person could still confiscate
weapons

06:37:35.590 --> 06:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
06:37:38.390 --> 06:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
so I thought that at least if he was
 
06:37:41.208 --> 06:37:41.218 align:start position:0%
acting under the under the terms of this
 
06:37:43.430 --> 06:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
statue this would prohibit him from
 
06:37:45.650 --> 06:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
giving such an order unless he was going
 
06:37:47.628 --> 06:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
to take additional criminal charges
 
06:37:50.270 --> 06:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
under another statute to accomplish it
 
06:37:53.628 --> 06:37:53.638 align:start position:0%
so you know to me I think possibly this
 
06:37:55.610 --> 06:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
would be a way of saving the bill I
 
06:37:56.868 --> 06:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
don't know how other people feel about
 
06:37:59.448 --> 06:37:59.458 align:start position:0%
it I didn't submit it to OLS for a
 
06:38:01.310 --> 06:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
formal Amendment because it seemed a
 
06:38:02.690 --> 06:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
little controversial for the way
 
06:38:04.430 --> 06:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
everybody in this committee really
 
06:38:07.670 --> 06:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
talked about it but I do know that I
 
06:38:09.170 --> 06:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
can't remember one of the other members
 
06:38:10.670 --> 06:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
of this committee said what if we just
 
06:38:12.650 --> 06:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
excluded firearm and that got me
 
06:38:15.350 --> 06:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
thinking about it it would still protect
 
06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
most of the people we're most worried
 
06:38:17.040 --> 06:38:17.810 align:start position:0%
most of the people we're most worried
about

06:38:17.810 --> 06:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:38:20.150 --> 06:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
but when we some people still a little
 
06:38:22.910 --> 06:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
bit at risk and if it turns out that
 
06:38:24.530 --> 06:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
later on we discovered we should have
 
06:38:26.270 --> 06:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
included that to be very easy to remove
 
06:38:28.368 --> 06:38:28.378 align:start position:0%
it but let's put it in now and get the
 
06:38:33.770 --> 06:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:33.780 --> 06:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:38:36.240 --> 06:38:36.250 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:36.250 --> 06:38:37.548 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:38:37.548 --> 06:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:38:40.310 --> 06:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
through OLS as a formal Amendment coming
 
06:38:42.070 --> 06:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
to us did you
 
06:38:46.310 --> 06:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
you do I want to be 100 sure okay I
 
06:38:48.948 --> 06:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
would I would I didn't well I sent it
 
06:38:50.448 --> 06:38:50.458 align:start position:0%
out to everybody and asked me to think
 
06:38:52.970 --> 06:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
about it and so forth I didn't think it
 
06:38:54.350 --> 06:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to have a discussion
 
06:38:56.390 --> 06:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
online because we weren't officially in
 
06:38:58.610 --> 06:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
the committee and I know the rest of you
 
06:39:00.350 --> 06:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
felt about me putting in this amendment
 
06:39:02.570 --> 06:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
I think if you feel that it would save
 
06:39:05.270 --> 06:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
the bill and it would satisfy some
 
06:39:07.970 --> 06:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
people's due process concerns let's
 
06:39:11.208 --> 06:39:11.218 align:start position:0%
submit it and and see what happens but
 
06:39:14.810 --> 06:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
if not and I did when I wrote it I said
 
06:39:17.510 --> 06:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
I wrote any protective action taken on h
 
06:39:20.330 --> 06:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
no 246 and I realized that you'd have to
 
06:39:23.208 --> 06:39:23.218 align:start position:0%
take out HP 246 and put in this statue
 
06:39:25.970 --> 06:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
but other than that I think the wording
 
06:39:28.548 --> 06:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
is relatively simple and if you know
 
06:39:30.530 --> 06:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
I've read the bill a number of times and
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
I think these are the only two places
 
06:39:34.128 --> 06:39:34.138 align:start position:0%
you really have to put it in order to
 
06:39:35.990 --> 06:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
have that
 
06:39:38.990 --> 06:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
I I think I can I I think I can speak to
 
06:39:41.650 --> 06:39:41.660 align:start position:0%
that representative snow in a number of
 
06:39:44.930 --> 06:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
discussions Each of which was quite 91a
 
06:39:44.940 --> 06:39:46.430 align:start position:0%
discussions Each of which was quite 91a
legal

06:39:46.430 --> 06:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
legal
 
06:39:50.208 --> 06:39:50.218 align:start position:0%
we feel that even if it was stipulated
 
06:39:52.430 --> 06:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
that this has nothing to do with guns
 
06:39:54.970 --> 06:39:54.980 align:start position:0%
and Guns are forbidden subject in this
 
06:39:57.470 --> 06:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
we we have other trouble with the bill
 
06:39:59.930 --> 06:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
so even if your Amendment came forward
 
06:40:02.448 --> 06:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
which we appreciate the graciousness of
 
06:40:04.250 --> 06:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
it I do anyway
 
06:40:05.628 --> 06:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't have made any difference
 
06:40:07.730 --> 06:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
on how we'll vote
 
06:40:10.510 --> 06:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
in what way I don't I do not understand
 
06:40:13.548 --> 06:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
uh we have other problems with the bill
 
06:40:15.470 --> 06:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
even if it was
 
06:40:18.410 --> 06:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
written into the bill your Amendment
 
06:40:21.048 --> 06:40:21.058 align:start position:0%
we would still have other problems with
 
06:40:23.150 --> 06:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
the bill so
 
06:40:25.670 --> 06:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's why we didn't salute it it didn't
 
06:40:25.680 --> 06:40:26.750 align:start position:0%
that's why we didn't salute it it didn't
fix

06:40:26.750 --> 06:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
fix
 
06:40:29.090 --> 06:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
the problem I don't understand the other
 
06:40:32.208 --> 06:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
problems well let me call on a few other
 
06:40:34.970 --> 06:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
folks and if they don't outline them I
 
06:40:36.970 --> 06:40:36.980 align:start position:0%
will but I'd like to call on them
 
06:40:42.170 --> 06:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:44.090 --> 06:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:40:44.100 --> 06:40:45.110 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

06:40:45.110 --> 06:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:47.570 --> 06:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
so yeah I am actually the one who who
 
06:40:49.430 --> 06:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
had asked one of the uh one of the
 
06:40:51.530 --> 06:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
people getting testimony about
 
06:40:53.570 --> 06:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would be comfortable
 
06:40:56.330 --> 06:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
taking or inserting language that would
 
06:40:59.208 --> 06:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
would specifically exclude Firearms
 
06:41:01.610 --> 06:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
confiscation and I found it rather
 
06:41:03.410 --> 06:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
interesting that the the answer to that
 
06:41:06.708 --> 06:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
was not an affirmative yes at the time
 
06:41:08.930 --> 06:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I I actually think that the the
 
06:41:11.690 --> 06:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this bill uh several sessions
 
06:41:14.890 --> 06:41:14.900 align:start position:0%
ago in which Firearms were mentioned
 
06:41:19.910 --> 06:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
some 20 times or so or perhaps more
 
06:41:23.030 --> 06:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
um is is fairly revealing I think that
 
06:41:26.510 --> 06:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
even if this were to exclude uh Firearms
 
06:41:28.788 --> 06:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
confiscationist it is still problematic
 
06:41:31.730 --> 06:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
insofar as it
 
06:41:37.430 --> 06:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
um it it does exclude due process and
 
06:41:41.030 --> 06:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
um there are implications even if
 
06:41:43.670 --> 06:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
even if we were to insert language I
 
06:41:46.250 --> 06:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
have learned uh that there there still
 
06:41:48.110 --> 06:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
would be implications for firearms
 
06:41:48.120 --> 06:41:49.670 align:start position:0%
would be implications for firearms
ownership

06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
06:41:52.310 --> 06:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
um which is that you know someone who is
 
06:41:55.430 --> 06:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
Accused under this statute whether
 
06:41:59.030 --> 06:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
rightly or wrongly uh would go on a list
 
06:42:01.930 --> 06:42:01.940 align:start position:0%
that is checked as part of the
 
06:42:04.548 --> 06:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
background check process when a Firearms
 
06:42:07.690 --> 06:42:07.700 align:start position:0%
purchase occurs so there there are
 
06:42:12.190 --> 06:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
fundamental issues with this premise of
 
06:42:15.830 --> 06:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
a bypassing due process whether whether
 
06:42:19.910 --> 06:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
the bill says that Firearms seizure will
 
06:42:23.628 --> 06:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
be excluded or not the the concern is is
 
06:42:26.030 --> 06:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
still very much there and I guess I
 
06:42:27.770 --> 06:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
would I would just underscore the fact
 
06:42:27.780 --> 06:42:28.788 align:start position:0%
would I would just underscore the fact
that

06:42:28.788 --> 06:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:42:30.650 --> 06:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
um the the right to keep and bear arms
 
06:42:34.910 --> 06:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
is is a constitutional right it is
 
06:42:37.610 --> 06:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
um is specifically called out in the
 
06:42:40.548 --> 06:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh for a reason just as
 
06:42:43.730 --> 06:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
free speech and free exercise of
 
06:42:43.740 --> 06:42:45.190 align:start position:0%
free speech and free exercise of
religion

06:42:45.190 --> 06:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
religion
 
06:42:48.650 --> 06:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
and so it really goes far beyond what
 
06:42:50.448 --> 06:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
might you know some some people may
 
06:42:53.330 --> 06:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
prefer to see it as uh something more
 
06:42:56.230 --> 06:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
like uh driving which is actually
 
06:42:59.090 --> 06:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
categorized as a privilege not a not as
 
06:43:02.090 --> 06:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
a right under under the law so
 
06:43:04.730 --> 06:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
you know I I believe that whether this
 
06:43:07.850 --> 06:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
is amended as uh as representative snow
 
06:43:10.490 --> 06:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
is suggesting or not I still think that
 
06:43:14.390 --> 06:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
it is not a good bill I do not think we
 
06:43:16.970 --> 06:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
should uh you know I I do not think we
 
06:43:19.368 --> 06:43:19.378 align:start position:0%
should move it forward so I will be
 
06:43:21.190 --> 06:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
voting to itl
 
06:43:23.948 --> 06:43:23.958 align:start position:0%
I think your representative
 
06:43:26.990 --> 06:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
06:43:29.570 --> 06:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
06:43:29.580 --> 06:43:32.090 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
um

06:43:32.090 --> 06:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:35.990 --> 06:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
almost almost everybody who I've heard
 
06:43:38.448 --> 06:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
talk against this bill has started off
 
06:43:41.030 --> 06:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
with I know this is a well-intentioned
 
06:43:43.010 --> 06:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
bill but
 
06:43:46.128 --> 06:43:46.138 align:start position:0%
um and in my view this bill has been
 
06:43:49.150 --> 06:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
permanently stained since it did include
 
06:43:52.030 --> 06:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
Firearms confiscation a few years ago
 
06:43:55.010 --> 06:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
and there's no way to get beyond that at
 
06:43:57.048 --> 06:43:57.058 align:start position:0%
this point so I would challenge people
 
06:44:00.708 --> 06:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
who are voting against this bill
 
06:44:02.628 --> 06:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
um because I don't think that we can
 
06:44:06.048 --> 06:44:06.058 align:start position:0%
find an amendment that is going to um
 
06:44:08.470 --> 06:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
convince people to vote for this bill
 
06:44:11.868 --> 06:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
but I would challenge people perhaps in
 
06:44:13.490 --> 06:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
this conversation
 
06:44:17.090 --> 06:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
to talk about their ideas about
 
06:44:19.970 --> 06:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
how we could start over and what we
 
06:44:22.368 --> 06:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
could do to address the problem which is
 
06:44:26.208 --> 06:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
the exploitation and abuse of elderly
 
06:44:26.218 --> 06:44:28.010 align:start position:0%
the exploitation and abuse of elderly
and

06:44:28.010 --> 06:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:44:29.810 --> 06:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
um disabled people who are not able to
 
06:44:32.868 --> 06:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
fend for themselves if not this bill
 
06:44:36.850 --> 06:44:36.860 align:start position:0%
what ideas how do we perceive
 
06:44:40.730 --> 06:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you I I would agree oh excuse me
 
06:44:43.548 --> 06:44:43.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh representative gay we're
 
06:44:45.288 --> 06:44:45.298 align:start position:0%
going to let everybody have a go and
 
06:44:46.910 --> 06:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
then we'll go to round two
 
06:44:49.670 --> 06:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you Mr chairman
 
06:44:52.670 --> 06:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I definitely agree with
 
06:44:54.288 --> 06:44:54.298 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and
 
06:44:56.330 --> 06:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative snow and representative
 
06:44:58.970 --> 06:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
Lucy what's your last name
 
06:44:58.980 --> 06:44:59.628 align:start position:0%
Lucy what's your last name
um

06:44:59.628 --> 06:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:02.270 --> 06:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
there's a crying need for protection and
 
06:45:06.350 --> 06:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
I went through with a friend who had
 
06:45:10.548 --> 06:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
developed Alzheimer's and never got what
 
06:45:12.830 --> 06:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
we went to court and nothing good
 
06:45:12.840 --> 06:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
we went to court and nothing good
happened

06:45:14.390 --> 06:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
happened
 
06:45:17.090 --> 06:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
um and so I think we do need a totally
 
06:45:20.030 --> 06:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
new bill there's a definitely crying
 
06:45:23.448 --> 06:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
need for one but this one this bill was
 
06:45:26.448 --> 06:45:26.458 align:start position:0%
way too much like the one before and I
 
06:45:29.930 --> 06:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
also agree that I'm always want
 
06:45:29.940 --> 06:45:30.830 align:start position:0%
also agree that I'm always want
um

06:45:30.830 --> 06:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:33.110 --> 06:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
I let's see what do you call it when
 
06:45:34.850 --> 06:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
they have hearings and you're not
 
06:45:37.910 --> 06:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
invited and it's all about you
 
06:45:37.920 --> 06:45:38.510 align:start position:0%
invited and it's all about you
um

06:45:38.510 --> 06:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:41.868 --> 06:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
anybody think of that word ex parte ex
 
06:45:44.930 --> 06:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
parte yeah yes I absolutely don't like
 
06:45:47.510 --> 06:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
ex parte and yet there must be some way
 
06:45:50.390 --> 06:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
to protect people's
 
06:45:52.430 --> 06:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
um bank accounts when somebody is
 
06:45:55.430 --> 06:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
stealing them so if that's a much more
 
06:45:58.368 --> 06:45:58.378 align:start position:0%
complex thing to be dealt with it does
 
06:46:00.708 --> 06:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
need to be dealt with this bill doesn't
 
06:46:03.230 --> 06:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
does not offer the protections that we
 
06:46:05.690 --> 06:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
really need but we really need that bill
 
06:46:07.810 --> 06:46:07.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that we follow
 
06:46:10.690 --> 06:46:10.700 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's recommendation
 
06:46:13.490 --> 06:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
that a lot of heads get together and
 
06:46:16.930 --> 06:46:16.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:19.128 --> 06:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh
 
06:46:21.410 --> 06:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:46:23.990 --> 06:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
everyone for your comments I agree with
 
06:46:25.730 --> 06:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro that there is a
 
06:46:27.830 --> 06:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
need to protect uh elderly people
 
06:46:29.868 --> 06:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
particularly from Financial exploitation
 
06:46:32.390 --> 06:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
and other sorts of exploitation and I
 
06:46:34.430 --> 06:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
will call as attention to existing law
 
06:46:37.548 --> 06:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
RSA 6319 is entitled Financial
 
06:46:39.708 --> 06:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
exploitation of an elderly disabled or
 
06:46:42.830 --> 06:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
impaired adult and I would suggest that
 
06:46:45.110 --> 06:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
if this existing statute is
 
06:46:47.208 --> 06:46:47.218 align:start position:0%
unsatisfactory we amend the existing
 
06:46:49.490 --> 06:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
statute and not write an entirely new
 
06:46:52.490 --> 06:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
section of law uh to solve a problem
 
06:46:54.288 --> 06:46:54.298 align:start position:0%
that we already have a statute in place
 
06:46:57.110 --> 06:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
to attempt to solve thank you chair
 
06:47:01.368 --> 06:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
calls on himself we also have RSA 631 8
 
06:47:04.670 --> 06:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
and 631 10.
 
06:47:08.448 --> 06:47:08.458 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill itself on page three line
 
06:47:11.628 --> 06:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
29 it speaks about not being bound by
 
06:47:14.690 --> 06:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
technical Rules of Evidence there's a
 
06:47:19.128 --> 06:47:19.138 align:start position:0%
number of these little flaws and uh why
 
06:47:22.850 --> 06:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
and my my final point is
 
06:47:27.948 --> 06:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
on February 8th page A4 of the New
 
06:47:31.070 --> 06:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire union leader woman charged
 
06:47:32.990 --> 06:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
with stealing identity of adult
 
06:47:34.788 --> 06:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
acquaintance I thought they couldn't
 
06:47:36.468 --> 06:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
charge her because this bill hasn't
 
06:47:40.250 --> 06:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
passed this is an individual who
 
06:47:43.788 --> 06:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
um eight felony counts of identity fraud
 
06:47:47.930 --> 06:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
and theft by unauthorized taking
 
06:47:52.690 --> 06:47:52.700 align:start position:0%
uh elder abuse is here and this person
 
06:47:55.070 --> 06:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
could have
 
06:47:57.770 --> 06:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
30 years in the state prison and four
 
06:48:00.708 --> 06:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fine for each of the
 
06:48:00.718 --> 06:48:01.968 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fine for each of the
charges

06:48:01.968 --> 06:48:01.978 align:start position:0%
charges
 
06:48:01.978 --> 06:48:03.910 align:start position:0%
charges
now

06:48:03.910 --> 06:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:48:06.468 --> 06:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
that sounds like we have some things on
 
06:48:08.990 --> 06:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
the books with teeth so the first thing
 
06:48:11.448 --> 06:48:11.458 align:start position:0%
people wanting a bill on this have to
 
06:48:15.288 --> 06:48:15.298 align:start position:0%
convince me is what is missing from the
 
06:48:18.708 --> 06:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
existing law because that person that 56
 
06:48:20.750 --> 06:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
year old Pelham woman who may be going
 
06:48:23.170 --> 06:48:23.180 align:start position:0%
to jail for the rest of her natural life
 
06:48:26.330 --> 06:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh committed some crimes against laws
 
06:48:28.548 --> 06:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
that are already on the books
 
06:48:30.650 --> 06:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
one final Point
 
06:48:30.660 --> 06:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
one final Point
um

06:48:31.430 --> 06:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:34.430 --> 06:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
in my 46 years as a clergyman I have had
 
06:48:37.850 --> 06:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
four cases of adults who have been
 
06:48:41.208 --> 06:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
exploited elder abuse
 
06:48:45.110 --> 06:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
I also have had two cases of individuals
 
06:48:49.690 --> 06:48:49.700 align:start position:0%
who are improperly and unjustly accused
 
06:48:52.490 --> 06:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
and after their lives were made of
 
06:48:55.910 --> 06:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
shambles after a lot of money had to be
 
06:48:59.270 --> 06:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
spent after they lost their job after
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
their reputation was ruined the finding
 
06:49:05.270 --> 06:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
was oh they didn't do it we caught the
 
06:49:08.810 --> 06:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
person who really did so while I very
 
06:49:10.190 --> 06:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
much weep
 
06:49:13.128 --> 06:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
for those people who are abused I very
 
06:49:15.590 --> 06:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
much weep for those who are have their
 
06:49:19.850 --> 06:49:19.860 align:start position:0%
lives ruined by a bill that is not as
 
06:49:23.330 --> 06:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
tight and precise as it should be so I'm
 
06:49:25.070 --> 06:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
very clearly voting against this bill
 
06:49:28.128 --> 06:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
and I would say the burden is on those
 
06:49:30.708 --> 06:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
who think that the laws we have on the
 
06:49:32.690 --> 06:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
books are insufficient
 
06:49:36.410 --> 06:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
to show us why and how what is missing
 
06:49:38.690 --> 06:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
it wasn't missing for that woman in
 
06:49:42.708 --> 06:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
Pelham what is missing and then show us
 
06:49:45.770 --> 06:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
some ways we can fix what we have and do
 
06:49:48.468 --> 06:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
it in a way that doesn't violate the
 
06:49:51.350 --> 06:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
civil rights of others
 
06:49:53.930 --> 06:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
06:49:53.940 --> 06:49:56.930 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
foreign

06:49:56.930 --> 06:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:59.208 --> 06:49:59.218 align:start position:0%
I would just say that I think the
 
06:50:01.190 --> 06:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
difference between someone being charged
 
06:50:04.070 --> 06:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
after the fact is that this bill was
 
06:50:08.230 --> 06:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
created to for prevention rather than
 
06:50:11.570 --> 06:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
accountability afterwards and
 
06:50:11.580 --> 06:50:13.010 align:start position:0%
accountability afterwards and
um

06:50:13.010 --> 06:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:16.070 --> 06:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the idea of taking immediate action
 
06:50:19.930 --> 06:50:19.940 align:start position:0%
to prevent abuse happening in the moment
 
06:50:22.610 --> 06:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
creates some real trade-offs or
 
06:50:26.270 --> 06:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts with due process it it
 
06:50:26.280 --> 06:50:27.948 align:start position:0%
conflicts with due process it it
um

06:50:27.948 --> 06:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:30.350 --> 06:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I I understand that and I understand
 
06:50:32.810 --> 06:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
that's a hard pill to swallow but many
 
06:50:34.910 --> 06:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
many things we do in this country in
 
06:50:36.770 --> 06:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
this democracy
 
06:50:36.780 --> 06:50:37.610 align:start position:0%
this democracy
um

06:50:37.610 --> 06:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:40.548 --> 06:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
involve trade-offs of
 
06:50:40.558 --> 06:50:41.208 align:start position:0%
involve trade-offs of
um

06:50:41.208 --> 06:50:41.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:43.310 --> 06:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
the greater good versus the individual
 
06:50:45.650 --> 06:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
good or one person's rights versus the
 
06:50:47.208 --> 06:50:47.218 align:start position:0%
others and that's the thing that we're
 
06:50:49.128 --> 06:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
here trying to think intelligently about
 
06:50:49.138 --> 06:50:50.510 align:start position:0%
here trying to think intelligently about
and

06:50:50.510 --> 06:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:50:50.520 --> 06:50:51.410 align:start position:0%
and
um

06:50:51.410 --> 06:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:53.868 --> 06:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
create a good bill for
 
06:50:53.878 --> 06:50:56.750 align:start position:0%
create a good bill for
um

06:50:56.750 --> 06:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:59.628 --> 06:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
so I understand what you're saying but I
 
06:51:01.250 --> 06:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
think the difference is that this bill
 
06:51:03.288 --> 06:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
would address protecting somebody in the
 
06:51:05.750 --> 06:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
moment versus accountability after the
 
06:51:05.760 --> 06:51:07.310 align:start position:0%
moment versus accountability after the
fact

06:51:07.310 --> 06:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
fact
 
06:51:15.288 --> 06:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:18.708 --> 06:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none we have I did I wanted to
 
06:51:21.230 --> 06:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
yes that's right you get a second go I'm
 
06:51:23.930 --> 06:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
sorry representative I'm sorry no no I'm
 
06:51:27.410 --> 06:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
really sorry I I I I read almost every
 
06:51:29.690 --> 06:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
one of the hundreds of responses we got
 
06:51:32.150 --> 06:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
to this bill all of which
 
06:51:35.090 --> 06:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three defended the bill all
 
06:51:36.770 --> 06:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
the rest was saying how due process
 
06:51:40.128 --> 06:51:40.138 align:start position:0%
against people who might lose their guns
 
06:51:42.770 --> 06:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
was the point of the thing but what
 
06:51:44.810 --> 06:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
about the due process of this elderly
 
06:51:47.390 --> 06:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
woman that has seen her relatives
 
06:51:49.490 --> 06:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
siphoning off her money
 
06:51:52.190 --> 06:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay so you go to court and you make a
 
06:51:54.110 --> 06:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
charge against her in the meantime this
 
06:51:56.330 --> 06:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
woman is still subject to the influence
 
06:51:58.010 --> 06:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
of these relatives who are stealing from
 
06:51:58.020 --> 06:51:58.910 align:start position:0%
of these relatives who are stealing from
her

06:51:58.910 --> 06:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
her
 
06:52:01.010 --> 06:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
there's no immediate action that can be
 
06:52:02.570 --> 06:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
taken to stop it
 
06:52:04.730 --> 06:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
I as a social worker used to have to go
 
06:52:07.788 --> 06:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
into homes and I saw people lying in a
 
06:52:10.128 --> 06:52:10.138 align:start position:0%
bed in their own filth have not been fed
 
06:52:14.868 --> 06:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
in days and you can make a charge but
 
06:52:16.910 --> 06:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
nothing immediately happens to stop this
 
06:52:19.548 --> 06:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
from going on in the meantime and we can
 
06:52:22.070 --> 06:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
talk about due process but under the way
 
06:52:24.530 --> 06:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
the bill goes there is a bit of an
 
06:52:26.270 --> 06:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
expati but I don't know where that
 
06:52:29.570 --> 06:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
applies other than I don't see why if
 
06:52:32.448 --> 06:52:32.458 align:start position:0%
you were told to no longer steal money
 
06:52:34.010 --> 06:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
from your grandmother
 
06:52:36.410 --> 06:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
that that would in any way come into
 
06:52:38.448 --> 06:52:38.458 align:start position:0%
being when you're going to purchase a
 
06:52:38.458 --> 06:52:39.288 align:start position:0%
being when you're going to purchase a
gun

06:52:39.288 --> 06:52:39.298 align:start position:0%
gun
 
06:52:41.510 --> 06:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
because we're not talking about guns or
 
06:52:44.030 --> 06:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
anything to do with it uh
 
06:52:47.750 --> 06:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if even anybody that has a
 
06:52:50.390 --> 06:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
restraining order placed against him by
 
06:52:52.490 --> 06:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
a relative and you could do that as well
 
06:52:54.830 --> 06:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
but that's a court thing in office no
 
06:52:57.288 --> 06:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
immediate satisfaction in fact sometimes
 
06:52:59.090 --> 06:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
it takes so long that something happens
 
06:53:02.330 --> 06:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
in the interim but I guess I'm concerned
 
06:53:04.430 --> 06:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
that we are very concerned about a few
 
06:53:07.548 --> 06:53:07.558 align:start position:0%
people's due process rights I know the
 
06:53:10.010 --> 06:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
expat a thing isn't good but you can ask
 
06:53:11.750 --> 06:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
for and you'll be right right in this
 
06:53:15.048 --> 06:53:15.058 align:start position:0%
bill ask for an expedited hearing the
 
06:53:17.330 --> 06:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
longest that can go is three days
 
06:53:20.448 --> 06:53:20.458 align:start position:0%
and the only thing that I know that that
 
06:53:20.458 --> 06:53:21.288 align:start position:0%
and the only thing that I know that that
really

06:53:21.288 --> 06:53:21.298 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:53:24.350 --> 06:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
defends against is having a guns return
 
06:53:25.968 --> 06:53:25.978 align:start position:0%
but we're not taking their guns away
 
06:53:28.310 --> 06:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
anymore we're simply saying you can't
 
06:53:30.890 --> 06:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
continue to do this right away later on
 
06:53:32.390 --> 06:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
you can challenge that whether or not
 
06:53:34.610 --> 06:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
you were doing it or not doing it and I
 
06:53:36.770 --> 06:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
don't know why being accused of
 
06:53:38.090 --> 06:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
something and founding innocent other
 
06:53:39.530 --> 06:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
things like this that we would now
 
06:53:42.350 --> 06:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
include in this bill exploitation
 
06:53:42.360 --> 06:53:44.048 align:start position:0%
include in this bill exploitation
neglect

06:53:44.048 --> 06:53:44.058 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
06:53:46.670 --> 06:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
and that board is on abuse I think
 
06:53:47.990 --> 06:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
you'll agree some of the things that
 
06:53:50.570 --> 06:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
I've seen over the years are clearly
 
06:53:53.150 --> 06:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
abusive but they don't involve beating
 
06:53:54.590 --> 06:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
someone up but threatening them with a
 
06:53:54.600 --> 06:53:55.430 align:start position:0%
someone up but threatening them with a
gun

06:53:55.430 --> 06:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
gun
 
06:53:59.090 --> 06:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
but I I think we haven't done enough
 
06:54:00.890 --> 06:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
I think we could look at some of those
 
06:54:02.570 --> 06:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
other bills but what that would require
 
06:54:05.208 --> 06:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
is taking those bills and building some
 
06:54:07.788 --> 06:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
immediate protective action in you know
 
06:54:09.890 --> 06:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
if you had the abuse bill I don't know
 
06:54:11.930 --> 06:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
how long it was between the time that
 
06:54:14.510 --> 06:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
woman was charged and when she ended up
 
06:54:15.948 --> 06:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
in court but I'll bet it was quite a
 
06:54:15.958 --> 06:54:21.230 align:start position:0%
in court but I'll bet it was quite a
while

06:54:21.230 --> 06:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:24.770 --> 06:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
it was two years sir yeah it makes your
 
06:54:26.410 --> 06:54:26.420 align:start position:0%
point what can happen in that two years
 
06:54:28.788 --> 06:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
whereas a bill like this would say Okay
 
06:54:31.548 --> 06:54:31.558 align:start position:0%
immediately you need to stop
 
06:54:33.770 --> 06:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
now they also are free to bring some
 
06:54:35.208 --> 06:54:35.218 align:start position:0%
other challenges and if it turns out
 
06:54:36.770 --> 06:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
it's more serious than you immediately
 
06:54:36.780 --> 06:54:37.490 align:start position:0%
it's more serious than you immediately
thought

06:54:37.490 --> 06:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
thought
 
06:54:40.010 --> 06:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
and they do have a right under any of
 
06:54:41.810 --> 06:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
these things if your name appears on a
 
06:54:44.150 --> 06:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
complaint brought by someone
 
06:54:47.150 --> 06:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
you can request an expante hearing
 
06:54:49.990 --> 06:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
and I mean an expeditious
 
06:54:52.910 --> 06:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
hearing is what I meant to say and and
 
06:54:55.788 --> 06:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
that gets wiped away but it still gives
 
06:54:57.708 --> 06:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
people a
 
06:55:00.650 --> 06:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
ability to develop a plan with increased
 
06:55:02.750 --> 06:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge to keep that person protected
 
06:55:05.570 --> 06:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm basically hoping
 
06:55:07.850 --> 06:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
this bill would provide now it may be
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
that down the road we can take one of
 
06:55:11.390 --> 06:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
those other bills as I think you
 
06:55:13.490 --> 06:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
suggested and build some things into
 
06:55:15.288 --> 06:55:15.298 align:start position:0%
that to give a more immediate response
 
06:55:17.270 --> 06:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime I don't know who
 
06:55:18.830 --> 06:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
would really be hurt by putting this in
 
06:55:20.510 --> 06:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's easy enough to take it off the
 
06:55:22.490 --> 06:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
books but right now there's no immediate
 
06:55:25.128 --> 06:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
protection for people are being abused
 
06:55:26.868 --> 06:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
in this way
 
06:55:29.030 --> 06:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh by other people either in their
 
06:55:31.610 --> 06:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
family or you know people at a Hyatt
 
06:55:33.890 --> 06:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
that come in as temporary help and I
 
06:55:35.750 --> 06:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
think we've all heard horror stories
 
06:55:37.150 --> 06:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
about things like that
 
06:55:40.730 --> 06:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
anyway I guess I'm just
 
06:55:43.310 --> 06:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
I think I've seen enough things in my
 
06:55:45.708 --> 06:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
career to know that I'm very bothered by
 
06:55:49.010 --> 06:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
the way some very vulnerable people are
 
06:55:50.690 --> 06:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
treated and people are much more
 
06:55:53.208 --> 06:55:53.218 align:start position:0%
concerned about the due process of the
 
06:55:55.490 --> 06:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
person committing these acts they are
 
06:55:57.350 --> 06:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
the due process of the person that's a
 
06:55:57.360 --> 06:55:58.128 align:start position:0%
the due process of the person that's a
victim

06:55:58.128 --> 06:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
victim
 
06:56:00.410 --> 06:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
and I think they deserve some immediate
 
06:56:02.390 --> 06:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
response to protect them if they're in a
 
06:56:04.730 --> 06:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
situation where they're at Great risk so
 
06:56:06.708 --> 06:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
that's that's my only argument against
 
06:56:08.930 --> 06:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
it and it's I'm the only one that feels
 
06:56:10.788 --> 06:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
that way it sounds to me like at least
 
06:56:12.708 --> 06:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro shares my concern
 
06:56:14.448 --> 06:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
but he's in the same profession I'm in
 
06:56:16.128 --> 06:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
but he's seen a lot of the same things
 
06:56:17.868 --> 06:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
I've seen over the years and I think you
 
06:56:20.030 --> 06:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
have Mr chairman and you're yes sir I
 
06:56:21.890 --> 06:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
have yes I have and let me take my
 
06:56:24.590 --> 06:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
second round turn here I too would very
 
06:56:27.170 --> 06:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
much like something that's immediate and
 
06:56:30.590 --> 06:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's why that two years before Justice
 
06:56:33.948 --> 06:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
was served for that poor woman in Pelham
 
06:56:36.830 --> 06:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we have to do something better but
 
06:56:39.410 --> 06:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
I find it ironic because the very people
 
06:56:40.910 --> 06:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
who taught me
 
06:56:42.730 --> 06:56:42.740 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
06:56:46.310 --> 06:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
have the rights of the accused
 
06:56:49.610 --> 06:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
upheld is not my people on the political
 
06:56:49.620 --> 06:56:51.110 align:start position:0%
upheld is not my people on the political
right

06:56:51.110 --> 06:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:56:54.230 --> 06:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I if I I could even stipulate this
 
06:56:56.690 --> 06:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
bill has nothing to do with guns and I
 
06:56:58.610 --> 06:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
try to say that to the hundreds of
 
06:57:00.948 --> 06:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
people who email me about the gun grab
 
06:57:04.070 --> 06:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is and no it's not it might
 
06:57:07.190 --> 06:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
incidentally be so in a few cases this
 
06:57:11.090 --> 06:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
is not the bill from a few years ago but
 
06:57:13.010 --> 06:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
it still troubles me that the rights of
 
06:57:15.850 --> 06:57:15.860 align:start position:0%
the innocent may be inappropriately
 
06:57:18.948 --> 06:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
trampled on and as I say I learned that
 
06:57:20.690 --> 06:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
from my liberal friends over the years
 
06:57:23.570 --> 06:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
so there's got to be a better way I
 
06:57:23.580 --> 06:57:24.350 align:start position:0%
so there's got to be a better way I
think

06:57:24.350 --> 06:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:57:24.360 --> 06:57:25.750 align:start position:0%
think
to

06:57:25.750 --> 06:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:57:29.170 --> 06:57:29.180 align:start position:0%
do expedited things so that the the
 
06:57:32.330 --> 06:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
putting people at risk harming
 
06:57:34.730 --> 06:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people is stopped not two
 
06:57:37.968 --> 06:57:37.978 align:start position:0%
years later but immediately and still
 
06:57:40.250 --> 06:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
uphold the rights of somebody accused
 
06:57:42.708 --> 06:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
who might actually be innocent so that's
 
06:57:44.930 --> 06:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
my plea anyway
 
06:57:50.208 --> 06:57:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:52.128 --> 06:57:52.138 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for letting me
 
06:57:54.170 --> 06:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
have my second round and and I will
 
06:57:57.468 --> 06:57:57.478 align:start position:0%
dress it only a couple of things
 
06:58:01.070 --> 06:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
the statutes that you're citing uh in
 
06:58:04.548 --> 06:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
the 600 range are criminal statutes
 
06:58:11.030 --> 06:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
they don't happen quickly because we do
 
06:58:14.090 --> 06:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
liberal or conservative are are are
 
06:58:16.670 --> 06:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
pretty careful of the rights of the
 
06:58:18.410 --> 06:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
accused because we are bringing the
 
06:58:21.110 --> 06:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
entire force of the State against an
 
06:58:24.708 --> 06:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
individual so we cannot take the
 
06:58:29.030 --> 06:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes and make them quick
 
06:58:31.670 --> 06:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's item number one item number two
 
06:58:34.670 --> 06:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
is if you are concerned about removing
 
06:58:34.680 --> 06:58:36.948 align:start position:0%
is if you are concerned about removing
Firearms

06:58:36.948 --> 06:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
Firearms
 
06:58:36.958 --> 06:58:38.208 align:start position:0%
Firearms
um

06:58:38.208 --> 06:58:38.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:40.968 --> 06:58:40.978 align:start position:0%
somebody who is charged under the
 
06:58:42.890 --> 06:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
criminal laws more likely to have their
 
06:58:46.190 --> 06:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
firearms taken away than somebody who is
 
06:58:49.490 --> 06:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
caught up in a civil proceeding
 
06:58:51.890 --> 06:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh the third thing is I'm just going to
 
06:58:54.110 --> 06:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
06:58:57.350 --> 06:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
it is horrible to be accused wrongly and
 
06:58:59.810 --> 06:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
it should not happen but it certainly
 
06:59:02.810 --> 06:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
happened to two people that
 
06:59:05.448 --> 06:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson knew without the
 
06:59:07.548 --> 06:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
benefit of this statute that's going to
 
06:59:08.930 --> 06:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
go on happening
 
06:59:11.990 --> 06:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that is going to go
 
06:59:15.650 --> 06:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
on happening is that the rights of
 
06:59:17.990 --> 06:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
innocent people are going to be
 
06:59:21.350 --> 06:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
infringed upon every single day going
 
06:59:21.360 --> 06:59:22.690 align:start position:0%
infringed upon every single day going
forward

06:59:22.690 --> 06:59:22.700 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:59:25.730 --> 06:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
it's just going to be the rights of
 
06:59:27.468 --> 06:59:27.478 align:start position:0%
our vulnerable people our more
 
06:59:29.810 --> 06:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations
 
06:59:31.910 --> 06:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and and I just think that's a
 
06:59:33.770 --> 06:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
terrible shame and I certainly will be
 
06:59:35.208 --> 06:59:35.218 align:start position:0%
glad to work
 
06:59:38.030 --> 06:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
going forward on other ways of dealing
 
06:59:41.750 --> 06:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
with this but there are not a lot of
 
06:59:45.350 --> 06:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
other options to work quickly
 
06:59:48.230 --> 06:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
through to address quickly a problem
 
06:59:50.810 --> 06:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
that needs to address quickly and it
 
06:59:52.310 --> 06:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
can't be done through the criminal
 
06:59:54.650 --> 06:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
justice system
 
06:59:57.890 --> 06:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and that's I I will try very hard not
 
06:59:59.990 --> 07:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
to say anything else at this point and I
 
07:00:05.208 --> 07:00:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:07.310 --> 07:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
if I could
 
07:00:10.250 --> 07:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps one other area we could explore
 
07:00:12.468 --> 07:00:12.478 align:start position:0%
currently if you're under the age of 18
 
07:00:15.708 --> 07:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
and you're being abused there is a state
 
07:00:19.670 --> 07:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
office that can walk in and without
 
07:00:22.850 --> 07:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
if they determine that this child is
 
07:00:25.368 --> 07:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
very much at risk they can be removed
 
07:00:27.590 --> 07:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
or other actions can be taken and people
 
07:00:30.590 --> 07:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
can be forced forced in the end it could
 
07:00:32.570 --> 07:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
end up in court but in the meantime some
 
07:00:34.368 --> 07:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
protective actions can be taken to make
 
07:00:36.948 --> 07:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
sure that child is safe
 
07:00:39.650 --> 07:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
I am simply saying I saw this bill is
 
07:00:41.208 --> 07:00:41.218 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing
 
07:00:43.850 --> 07:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
for elders and vulnerable people if we
 
07:00:45.830 --> 07:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
rework it then I think but we've got to
 
07:00:47.868 --> 07:00:47.878 align:start position:0%
think in terms we're willing to protect
 
07:00:47.878 --> 07:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
think in terms we're willing to protect
children

07:00:49.190 --> 07:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:00:51.230 --> 07:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
but older people with Alzheimer's
 
07:00:52.548 --> 07:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
disease or other kinds of physical
 
07:00:55.010 --> 07:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
disabilities we seem to think they're
 
07:00:56.330 --> 07:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
grown up they should be able to take
 
07:00:58.250 --> 07:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
care of themselves and the truth is they
 
07:00:58.260 --> 07:00:59.448 align:start position:0%
care of themselves and the truth is they
can't

07:00:59.448 --> 07:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
can't
 
07:01:03.590 --> 07:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
and it's it's wrong to hold the rights
 
07:01:03.600 --> 07:01:04.448 align:start position:0%
and it's it's wrong to hold the rights
of

07:01:04.448 --> 07:01:04.458 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:01:06.708 --> 07:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
people who think they can own guns and I
 
07:01:08.150 --> 07:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
have no problem with people owning guns
 
07:01:09.948 --> 07:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
my father was a gun collector my son
 
07:01:12.350 --> 07:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
collects guns I mean I'm not against gun
 
07:01:15.530 --> 07:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
owners I'm just saying that at times I
 
07:01:16.850 --> 07:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
think you can recall a couple of
 
07:01:18.890 --> 07:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
incidences that recently happened there
 
07:01:20.208 --> 07:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
was a man that walked into Mary
 
07:01:22.430 --> 07:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock hospital into the Intensive
 
07:01:24.350 --> 07:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
Care Unit shot his mother
 
07:01:26.628 --> 07:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
we had a we had a young man that went to
 
07:01:29.990 --> 07:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
a police or a supervised visitation at
 
07:01:31.548 --> 07:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
the YWCA
 
07:01:35.830 --> 07:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
shot him son and shot and shot himself
 
07:01:38.868 --> 07:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
and so at times
 
07:01:41.390 --> 07:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
this comes in so guns but I'm not
 
07:01:43.310 --> 07:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
willing to give up all the protections
 
07:01:45.110 --> 07:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
for older people merely because some
 
07:01:47.270 --> 07:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
people are so concerned that maybe their
 
07:01:49.070 --> 07:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
right to own a gun or buy a gun or
 
07:01:51.350 --> 07:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
whatever else it is of being infringed
 
07:01:52.730 --> 07:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
upon because it would almost never
 
07:01:52.740 --> 07:01:53.628 align:start position:0%
upon because it would almost never
happened

07:01:53.628 --> 07:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
happened
 
07:01:55.968 --> 07:01:55.978 align:start position:0%

07:02:20.750 --> 07:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
talking about take the child protection
 
07:02:20.760 --> 07:02:22.128 align:start position:0%
talking about take the child protection
laws

07:02:22.128 --> 07:02:22.138 align:start position:0%
laws
 
07:02:24.948 --> 07:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
and rewrite them or don't rewrite them
 
07:02:29.030 --> 07:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
just put put substitute uh vulnerable
 
07:02:32.390 --> 07:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
people where you have child uh the other
 
07:02:35.690 --> 07:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry my my computer keeps acting
 
07:02:38.390 --> 07:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
funny so that's why I'm not showing
 
07:02:38.400 --> 07:02:39.830 align:start position:0%
funny so that's why I'm not showing
anymore

07:02:39.830 --> 07:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
07:02:43.850 --> 07:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
um also when somebody has a DUI they
 
07:02:46.070 --> 07:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to have a hearing in
 
07:02:48.590 --> 07:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
three days but they don't wait for three
 
07:02:52.010 --> 07:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
days to arrest them or stop them and I
 
07:02:55.070 --> 07:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
understand injunctions can be made under
 
07:02:58.090 --> 07:02:58.100 align:start position:0%
other legal excuse me
 
07:03:01.968 --> 07:03:01.978 align:start position:0%
situations so that you could free I want
 
07:03:05.208 --> 07:03:05.218 align:start position:0%
to see a bill a law that says you can
 
07:03:07.930 --> 07:03:07.940 align:start position:0%
freeze someone's asset so somebody else
 
07:03:11.628 --> 07:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
can't take them an elderly person or a
 
07:03:13.670 --> 07:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
person who's sick
 
07:03:15.948 --> 07:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh and this other person that we all
 
07:03:19.368 --> 07:03:19.378 align:start position:0%
have horror stories of being robbed by
 
07:03:21.368 --> 07:03:21.378 align:start position:0%
somebody who pretends to be their friend
 
07:03:24.190 --> 07:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
I can't believe we can't come up
 
07:03:27.230 --> 07:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
applying laws that are applicable to
 
07:03:30.410 --> 07:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
other bad situations we really need to
 
07:03:32.930 --> 07:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
do this and they do need to be immediate
 
07:03:36.110 --> 07:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
and we have rep we already know about
 
07:03:38.930 --> 07:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
immediate reactions to children that we
 
07:03:40.750 --> 07:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
think are in dangerous situations
 
07:03:44.390 --> 07:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
immediate situations for somebody uh
 
07:03:46.010 --> 07:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
stop driving
 
07:03:49.128 --> 07:03:49.138 align:start position:0%
drunk or under the influence there has
 
07:03:52.128 --> 07:03:52.138 align:start position:0%
to be a way to write some good laws and
 
07:03:54.468 --> 07:03:54.478 align:start position:0%
we need to do it soon thank you
 
07:03:56.150 --> 07:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative gay representative
 
07:03:56.160 --> 07:03:58.490 align:start position:0%
representative gay representative
Shapiro

07:03:58.490 --> 07:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
07:04:01.010 --> 07:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
yes I hope I can count myself as one of
 
07:04:03.590 --> 07:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
those liberal friends who's um maybe
 
07:04:05.390 --> 07:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
influenced you about the rights of
 
07:04:08.330 --> 07:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
victims I hope you you are a liberal and
 
07:04:11.330 --> 07:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
you are my friend so I guess so
 
07:04:13.610 --> 07:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
um but what I would say about the the
 
07:04:16.430 --> 07:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system is that
 
07:04:19.968 --> 07:04:19.978 align:start position:0%
it's inspiring to me anyway
 
07:04:23.990 --> 07:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and it's imperfect and so especially
 
07:04:27.170 --> 07:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
in recent years with advances in DNA
 
07:04:29.868 --> 07:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
technology we've had a lot of
 
07:04:29.878 --> 07:04:31.670 align:start position:0%
technology we've had a lot of
exonerations

07:04:31.670 --> 07:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
exonerations
 
07:04:34.090 --> 07:04:34.100 align:start position:0%
where people were proven to not have
 
07:04:36.468 --> 07:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
committed crimes that we thought they
 
07:04:38.270 --> 07:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
did and some a lot of them have served a
 
07:04:40.430 --> 07:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
lot of time in prison
 
07:04:40.440 --> 07:04:41.750 align:start position:0%
lot of time in prison
um

07:04:41.750 --> 07:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:44.650 --> 07:04:44.660 align:start position:0%
and I know you're looking to
 
07:04:47.930 --> 07:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
avoid those kinds of miscarriages lesser
 
07:04:50.510 --> 07:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
miscarriages in this kind of situation
 
07:04:53.330 --> 07:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
but I would say that we
 
07:04:56.448 --> 07:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
find someone who was
 
07:04:56.458 --> 07:04:57.468 align:start position:0%
find someone who was
um

07:04:57.468 --> 07:04:57.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:00.350 --> 07:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
convicted of murder and spends years and
 
07:05:03.110 --> 07:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
years in prison and when we realize that
 
07:05:06.170 --> 07:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
he is innocent or she is innocent we let
 
07:05:08.628 --> 07:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
them go but we don't repeal the laws
 
07:05:09.830 --> 07:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
about murder
 
07:05:12.708 --> 07:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
and so I would say that in some way this
 
07:05:14.868 --> 07:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
is an equivalent that we're
 
07:05:16.490 --> 07:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
um we're we're throwing out the
 
07:05:18.530 --> 07:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
possibility of protection in the form of
 
07:05:22.250 --> 07:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
this potential law because
 
07:05:25.310 --> 07:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
um there may be someone who would be
 
07:05:27.670 --> 07:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
um accused unfairly and in fact
 
07:05:30.410 --> 07:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly if this law if this has
 
07:05:33.288 --> 07:05:33.298 align:start position:0%
become law eventually some people would
 
07:05:35.090 --> 07:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
be accused unfairly
 
07:05:38.448 --> 07:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
but our system is imperfect
 
07:05:40.670 --> 07:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you my friend
 
07:05:43.490 --> 07:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
07:05:46.788 --> 07:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
I see uh I'm not a big gun person I have
 
07:05:49.368 --> 07:05:49.378 align:start position:0%
a gun but I'm not a big gun person in my
 
07:05:51.590 --> 07:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
vote on this will not be to help the gun
 
07:05:54.468 --> 07:05:54.478 align:start position:0%
people because I have seen people who
 
07:05:58.430 --> 07:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
have been taken advantage of elderly on
 
07:06:01.070 --> 07:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
the other hand I think this needs to be
 
07:06:03.948 --> 07:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
I want to see this fix somehow I'm not
 
07:06:05.750 --> 07:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
sure this bill
 
07:06:08.030 --> 07:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
is what's going to work is there going
 
07:06:09.708 --> 07:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
to be another state somewhere or
 
07:06:12.170 --> 07:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
somebody that's done this that has a
 
07:06:12.180 --> 07:06:13.490 align:start position:0%
somebody that's done this that has a
better

07:06:13.490 --> 07:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
better
 
07:06:15.770 --> 07:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
look or an answer to doing this because
 
07:06:17.448 --> 07:06:17.458 align:start position:0%
I'm all in favor of protecting the
 
07:06:19.490 --> 07:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
elderly and I do believe they got abused
 
07:06:21.368 --> 07:06:21.378 align:start position:0%
but I also like the last person said
 
07:06:24.590 --> 07:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
there are people who
 
07:06:26.690 --> 07:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
there are bad people and there are other
 
07:06:28.250 --> 07:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
people that just take advantage of the
 
07:06:30.110 --> 07:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
situation so I'm not really sure how I'm
 
07:06:31.610 --> 07:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
going to vote on this one
 
07:06:34.850 --> 07:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Makai
 
07:06:37.628 --> 07:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chairman
 
07:06:40.850 --> 07:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
I won't repeat everything my fellow
 
07:06:44.890 --> 07:06:44.900 align:start position:0%
social workers have said I'm more
 
07:06:48.948 --> 07:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
pragmatic at this stage of my life I
 
07:06:51.350 --> 07:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much know how this bill is going
 
07:06:55.128 --> 07:06:55.138 align:start position:0%
to end up therefore if we are hearing a
 
07:06:55.138 --> 07:06:56.448 align:start position:0%
to end up therefore if we are hearing a
tremendous

07:06:56.448 --> 07:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
07:06:59.690 --> 07:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
support for this type of legislation
 
07:07:01.850 --> 07:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
I think we should get to work and bring
 
07:07:02.868 --> 07:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
that in
 
07:07:07.610 --> 07:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
to the second year and do the best we
 
07:07:10.490 --> 07:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
can because I think everybody is in
 
07:07:14.390 --> 07:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
favor of that so even though I'm kind of
 
07:07:17.810 --> 07:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
bought against this motion I very much
 
07:07:20.868 --> 07:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
support going ahead with this and
 
07:07:23.868 --> 07:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
solving it as much as we can thank you
 
07:07:28.490 --> 07:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:30.770 --> 07:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
07:07:33.288 --> 07:07:33.298 align:start position:0%
um more of a procedural issue is there
 
07:07:35.750 --> 07:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
any advantage of retaining a bill versus
 
07:07:37.190 --> 07:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
bringing another bill completely
 
07:07:41.810 --> 07:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:45.650 --> 07:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
there would be perhaps a Time advantage
 
07:07:50.810 --> 07:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
that a retained bill could be heard in
 
07:07:50.820 --> 07:07:52.430 align:start position:0%
that a retained bill could be heard in
January

07:07:52.430 --> 07:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
January
 
07:07:52.440 --> 07:07:53.150 align:start position:0%
January
um

07:07:53.150 --> 07:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:07:56.330 --> 07:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
we have a motion itl on the floor that
 
07:07:58.730 --> 07:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
would have to be defeated and then
 
07:08:00.410 --> 07:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
another motion would have to come
 
07:08:00.420 --> 07:08:02.208 align:start position:0%
another motion would have to come
forward

07:08:02.208 --> 07:08:02.218 align:start position:0%
forward
 
07:08:02.218 --> 07:08:02.868 align:start position:0%
forward
um

07:08:02.868 --> 07:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:05.030 --> 07:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
so I believe
 
07:08:09.288 --> 07:08:09.298 align:start position:0%
um I think that's correct if yeah I'm
 
07:08:11.208 --> 07:08:11.218 align:start position:0%
learning thank you yeah
 
07:08:14.030 --> 07:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
um that could happen that's what it
 
07:08:16.250 --> 07:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
would take
 
07:08:19.670 --> 07:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman if I may just I'm
 
07:08:22.670 --> 07:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
learning as well so in saying that it
 
07:08:26.270 --> 07:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
sounds like we do a retain then the
 
07:08:27.770 --> 07:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
committee or subcommittee or group of
 
07:08:27.780 --> 07:08:29.090 align:start position:0%
committee or subcommittee or group of
this

07:08:29.090 --> 07:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:08:32.390 --> 07:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
get together and work on the bill
 
07:08:35.030 --> 07:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
to make it workable for all the parties
 
07:08:37.850 --> 07:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
involved and then ultimately that goes
 
07:08:40.850 --> 07:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
back into legislative Hopper next year
 
07:08:43.730 --> 07:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
versus starting over from scratch it
 
07:08:46.250 --> 07:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're tanning it does allow
 
07:08:48.410 --> 07:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity for people in the
 
07:08:50.750 --> 07:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
community to work on it either during
 
07:08:53.208 --> 07:08:53.218 align:start position:0%
the summer and the fall and not have to
 
07:08:54.770 --> 07:08:54.780 align:start position:0%
literally start over from scratch is
 
07:08:56.570 --> 07:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
there any that's all I'm trying to get
 
07:08:58.850 --> 07:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
to I think honestly we would probably
 
07:09:00.948 --> 07:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
start over from scratch except for the
 
07:09:03.830 --> 07:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
idea that we very much want to help the
 
07:09:06.830 --> 07:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
elderly and as much as possible knowing
 
07:09:09.890 --> 07:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
it will never be perfect lower the risk
 
07:09:12.350 --> 07:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
that somebody will be inappropriately
 
07:09:16.250 --> 07:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
can accused and ruined I think would
 
07:09:18.048 --> 07:09:18.058 align:start position:0%
have to start over from scratch and what
 
07:09:21.170 --> 07:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
I would like to see my fantasy is
 
07:09:23.150 --> 07:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
um when when the when a bill comes back
 
07:09:25.548 --> 07:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
I want to see 10 Republicans and or five
 
07:09:27.110 --> 07:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
Republicans and five Democrat
 
07:09:29.448 --> 07:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors I want to see somebody who's
 
07:09:32.270 --> 07:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
an NRA member and somebody who's an ACLU
 
07:09:34.670 --> 07:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
card carrier and if you think Canuck and
 
07:09:35.930 --> 07:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
yourself are going to have fun this
 
07:09:38.330 --> 07:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
summer uh this group is going to have a
 
07:09:40.670 --> 07:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
lot of fun but I think it might be worth
 
07:09:40.680 --> 07:09:42.490 align:start position:0%
lot of fun but I think it might be worth
it

07:09:42.490 --> 07:09:42.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:09:45.010 --> 07:09:45.020 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes
 
07:09:48.830 --> 07:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
is it possible to withdraw like I
 
07:09:52.070 --> 07:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
seconded this bill to I tell it I would
 
07:09:54.468 --> 07:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
rather retain it is it possible if the
 
07:09:57.110 --> 07:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
both of us re withdrew
 
07:10:00.468 --> 07:10:00.478 align:start position:0%
and put a new without voting on it can
 
07:10:03.590 --> 07:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
we just withdraw it an issue of make an
 
07:10:05.030 --> 07:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
order um
 
07:10:08.390 --> 07:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
make a motion to retain I believe it is
 
07:10:10.430 --> 07:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
possible representative Weber
 
07:10:13.850 --> 07:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh it is possible if the moving party
 
07:10:17.208 --> 07:10:17.218 align:start position:0%
and the seconding party decide to do
 
07:10:20.090 --> 07:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
that and I will certainly go along with
 
07:10:22.850 --> 07:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
whatever people decide to do but I have
 
07:10:25.730 --> 07:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
to say having worked on this bill three
 
07:10:27.708 --> 07:10:27.718 align:start position:0%
times including the time when we brought
 
07:10:29.330 --> 07:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
it out of this committee you will
 
07:10:32.628 --> 07:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
remember twenty to zero
 
07:10:35.510 --> 07:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
because we had addressed many many of
 
07:10:37.128 --> 07:10:37.138 align:start position:0%
the issues that we've already talked
 
07:10:37.138 --> 07:10:38.628 align:start position:0%
the issues that we've already talked
about

07:10:38.628 --> 07:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:10:41.570 --> 07:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and I could go on for hours about how
 
07:10:44.208 --> 07:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
this bill does exactly
 
07:10:46.610 --> 07:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
the thing that several people have asked
 
07:10:48.890 --> 07:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
that a subsequent bill due
 
07:10:52.150 --> 07:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
I really think at this point that taking
 
07:10:54.830 --> 07:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
a new start
 
07:10:58.910 --> 07:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
is a better idea because just the fact
 
07:11:01.910 --> 07:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
that it has the same bill number
 
07:11:06.530 --> 07:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
even if it is completely reworked I feel
 
07:11:10.128 --> 07:11:10.138 align:start position:0%
that people who are not going to read
 
07:11:12.590 --> 07:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
the careful reworkings that are done
 
07:11:15.650 --> 07:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
over the summer I think we are far
 
07:11:17.930 --> 07:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
better to start again with a new build
 
07:11:21.410 --> 07:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
number and and work at that and see if
 
07:11:23.990 --> 07:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
we can't come up with something than we
 
07:11:26.570 --> 07:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
are to retain this bill and bring it
 
07:11:28.548 --> 07:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
back under the same number I think that
 
07:11:30.890 --> 07:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
well has been poisoned I think you're
 
07:11:34.070 --> 07:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
right and this does not mean that this
 
07:11:37.310 --> 07:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
summer and I appreciate the thought it
 
07:11:39.170 --> 07:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
could not mean it could mean that this
 
07:11:39.180 --> 07:11:40.010 align:start position:0%
could not mean it could mean that this
summer

07:11:40.010 --> 07:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
summer
 
07:11:43.368 --> 07:11:43.378 align:start position:0%
a group of people from all across the
 
07:11:43.378 --> 07:11:44.448 align:start position:0%
a group of people from all across the
Spectrum

07:11:44.448 --> 07:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
Spectrum
 
07:11:45.948 --> 07:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
could try
 
07:11:47.930 --> 07:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
to see if a new bill
 
07:11:50.090 --> 07:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
yeah sure a lot of the work's been done
 
07:11:52.190 --> 07:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
and we know that but we don't have to
 
07:11:54.288 --> 07:11:54.298 align:start position:0%
give it the same number because I agree
 
07:11:57.010 --> 07:11:57.020 align:start position:0%
the weld's been poisoned but if a
 
07:12:00.170 --> 07:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
bipartisan by sponsored
 
07:12:00.180 --> 07:12:02.330 align:start position:0%
bipartisan by sponsored
bill

07:12:02.330 --> 07:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:12:03.948 --> 07:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
if it's possible
 
07:12:05.930 --> 07:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
could be brought forth and thrown into
 
07:12:08.448 --> 07:12:08.458 align:start position:0%
the hopper in the fall and come up next
 
07:12:08.458 --> 07:12:09.948 align:start position:0%
the hopper in the fall and come up next
year

07:12:09.948 --> 07:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
year
 
07:12:12.288 --> 07:12:12.298 align:start position:0%
I think
 
07:12:17.810 --> 07:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:20.030 --> 07:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'd be willing to help on that I have
 
07:12:26.750 --> 07:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:30.230 --> 07:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
um also just write the bill yourself oh
 
07:12:32.690 --> 07:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
yeah you'd be the sponsor I would I
 
07:12:35.090 --> 07:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
would love to help out also because I am
 
07:12:37.310 --> 07:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
a transgender person to add another
 
07:12:39.590 --> 07:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
voice from the community because I think
 
07:12:42.350 --> 07:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
it would be important for us all it was
 
07:12:45.288 --> 07:12:45.298 align:start position:0%
also subject to abuse at times yeah I've
 
07:12:47.750 --> 07:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
been there in there representative
 
07:12:47.760 --> 07:12:49.010 align:start position:0%
been there in there representative
Merchant

07:12:49.010 --> 07:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
07:12:49.020 --> 07:12:50.150 align:start position:0%
Merchant
yeah

07:12:50.150 --> 07:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:12:51.948 --> 07:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
okay take your hand down thank you
 
07:12:53.628 --> 07:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
representative Folsom you got your hand
 
07:12:53.638 --> 07:12:54.650 align:start position:0%
representative Folsom you got your hand
up

07:12:54.650 --> 07:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
up
 
07:12:57.708 --> 07:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
um yes I would love to work with
 
07:13:02.208 --> 07:13:02.218 align:start position:0%
representative cannon on a new bill
 
07:13:02.218 --> 07:13:05.448 align:start position:0%
representative cannon on a new bill
despite

07:13:05.448 --> 07:13:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:08.390 --> 07:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
look go for it like despite how
 
07:13:10.788 --> 07:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about it I don't care about
 
07:13:13.310 --> 07:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
this bill it's the idea of protecting
 
07:13:16.670 --> 07:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
those people that I've now work my buns
 
07:13:20.030 --> 07:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
off make sure this happens so now maybe
 
07:13:22.788 --> 07:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
I'm a little too enthusiastic you may be
 
07:13:22.798 --> 07:13:23.530 align:start position:0%
I'm a little too enthusiastic you may be
right

07:13:23.530 --> 07:13:23.540 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:13:26.570 --> 07:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
but I can temper myself down if I think
 
07:13:27.708 --> 07:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
there's something that's going to go
 
07:13:30.288 --> 07:13:30.298 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I think that may be the
 
07:13:33.948 --> 07:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
best of solution uh but
 
07:13:36.230 --> 07:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm still
 
07:13:38.208 --> 07:13:38.218 align:start position:0%
without a pessimistic only because of
 
07:13:41.150 --> 07:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
the huge volume 12 with a four or 500
 
07:13:42.890 --> 07:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
emails so you all have got up this
 
07:13:45.948 --> 07:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
matter and uh you're absolutely right no
 
07:13:47.448 --> 07:13:47.458 align:start position:0%
matter what we did I think it's doomed
 
07:13:49.190 --> 07:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
at this point so starting it all over
 
07:13:51.468 --> 07:13:51.478 align:start position:0%
having a different title doing something
 
07:13:53.530 --> 07:13:53.540 align:start position:0%
else we may have to do something about
 
07:13:56.208 --> 07:13:56.218 align:start position:0%
creating some more organized
 
07:13:59.990 --> 07:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
organization somewhere like dcyf has now
 
07:14:02.628 --> 07:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
so that there's actually a plan for how
 
07:14:04.850 --> 07:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
they'll carry this out without leaving
 
07:14:08.448 --> 07:14:08.458 align:start position:0%
it it's not a willy-nilly with an expat
 
07:14:11.150 --> 07:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
a hearing in front of a judge only to
 
07:14:12.650 --> 07:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
carry it out it's got to be a better way
 
07:14:15.350 --> 07:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
to do it and I hope we can succeed in
 
07:14:17.930 --> 07:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
doing it thank you it's come to my
 
07:14:20.090 --> 07:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
attention that representative kanurk has
 
07:14:23.930 --> 07:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm to spare should yours yours
 
07:14:26.208 --> 07:14:26.218 align:start position:0%
ever Wayne
 
07:14:28.670 --> 07:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
07:14:30.910 --> 07:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
07:14:34.010 --> 07:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
maintain the motion that's out there and
 
07:14:34.020 --> 07:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
maintain the motion that's out there and
also

07:14:35.030 --> 07:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
07:14:36.830 --> 07:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
um throw my hat in the ring I would I
 
07:14:38.628 --> 07:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
would love to work on this as I started
 
07:14:40.730 --> 07:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
out I think this is really a
 
07:14:43.490 --> 07:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
well-intended bill and uh I'd like to
 
07:14:45.190 --> 07:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
see it work
 
07:14:48.110 --> 07:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
with the prime the Mover of the build
 
07:14:51.288 --> 07:14:51.298 align:start position:0%
not re we're calling it then the motion
 
07:14:53.750 --> 07:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
on the floor is the motion we are to
 
07:14:55.910 --> 07:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
consider but we're seeing a growing
 
07:14:58.788 --> 07:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
group of people across not only our
 
07:15:01.670 --> 07:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
Spectrum but the Spectrum who could uh
 
07:15:03.948 --> 07:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
start to work this summer does anybody
 
07:15:07.010 --> 07:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
have anything else to say or do we now
 
07:15:12.548 --> 07:15:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:15.530 --> 07:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman has a index
 
07:15:18.230 --> 07:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:18.240 --> 07:15:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
Mr chairman

07:15:19.430 --> 07:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
07:15:21.770 --> 07:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
um I would just urge the members of the
 
07:15:24.830 --> 07:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee to um since this bill seems to
 
07:15:27.830 --> 07:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
need to start from scratch and not you
 
07:15:30.770 --> 07:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
know it's going to need yeah it it
 
07:15:33.770 --> 07:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
should be itl today and you guys can
 
07:15:36.048 --> 07:15:36.058 align:start position:0%
bring a new version of what you want to
 
07:15:38.750 --> 07:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
do uh next session and my fellow
 
07:15:40.310 --> 07:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
scotsman's correct this bill's going to
 
07:15:41.810 --> 07:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
die somewhere if it doesn't die here
 
07:15:43.610 --> 07:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
it's going to die in the floor or it's
 
07:15:45.048 --> 07:15:45.058 align:start position:0%
going to die in the senate or it's going
 
07:15:46.628 --> 07:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
to die in the governor's desk
 
07:15:48.968 --> 07:15:48.978 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
07:15:51.948 --> 07:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
I think this committee this year I
 
07:15:53.930 --> 07:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
honestly believe they're all committed
 
07:15:56.570 --> 07:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
to fix this we know there's a problem we
 
07:15:58.128 --> 07:15:58.138 align:start position:0%
know there's two vert things out there
 
07:15:59.750 --> 07:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
but I can't believe with all the talent
 
07:16:02.030 --> 07:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
we have we can't fix this so I'd rather
 
07:16:05.570 --> 07:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
see us do it next year and get it right
 
07:16:08.150 --> 07:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
and we're all committed in various ways
 
07:16:09.708 --> 07:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
whether we actually serve on that
 
07:16:12.590 --> 07:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or speak to it we're all
 
07:16:14.628 --> 07:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
committed to make this happen folks this
 
07:16:16.490 --> 07:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
isn't a political lie we don't like
 
07:16:19.010 --> 07:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
those here this is a promise to one
 
07:16:19.020 --> 07:16:19.910 align:start position:0%
those here this is a promise to one
another

07:16:19.910 --> 07:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
another
 
07:16:19.920 --> 07:16:21.288 align:start position:0%
another
yeah

07:16:21.288 --> 07:16:21.298 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:16:24.410 --> 07:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative canarick
 
07:16:26.150 --> 07:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
I would just like to point out that as
 
07:16:28.968 --> 07:16:28.978 align:start position:0%
Charlie McMahon says let's get this done
 
07:16:30.288 --> 07:16:30.298 align:start position:0%
while we're still young because a lot of
 
07:16:31.788 --> 07:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
us are getting old enough we may need
 
07:16:33.548 --> 07:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
the statute someday
 
07:16:36.530 --> 07:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
well you know that is that is one reason
 
07:16:39.048 --> 07:16:39.058 align:start position:0%
why I'm concerned about your loaning not
 
07:16:41.150 --> 07:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
loaning excess enthusiasm that's not
 
07:16:44.390 --> 07:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:46.368 --> 07:16:46.378 align:start position:0%
he's not old to Mr chairman he's
 
07:16:48.948 --> 07:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
aggressively mature thank you I was
 
07:16:50.750 --> 07:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for that all right the question
 
07:16:54.230 --> 07:16:54.240 align:start position:0%

07:16:57.048 --> 07:16:57.058 align:start position:0%
moved by King seconded by gay the clerk
 
07:16:59.750 --> 07:16:59.760 align:start position:0%

07:17:02.510 --> 07:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
himself and and let me just say that uh
 
07:17:06.288 --> 07:17:06.298 align:start position:0%

07:18:45.650 --> 07:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
representative Woods no
 
07:18:48.910 --> 07:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant yes
 
07:18:52.788 --> 07:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson did my side win I

will also want to help on another bill
 
07:18:54.840 --> 07:19:01.628 align:start position:0%
will also want to help on another bill
yes

07:19:01.628 --> 07:19:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:04.610 --> 07:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
and there will be a Minority Report Mr
 
07:19:07.670 --> 07:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
chairman when do you need it by
 
07:19:11.930 --> 07:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:17.570 --> 07:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh and uh the motion carries 15 to six
 
07:19:20.990 --> 07:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and um we would I would ask
 
07:19:25.810 --> 07:19:25.820 align:start position:0%
for the majority report to come from
 
07:19:28.368 --> 07:19:28.378 align:start position:0%
representative King if I could have it
 
07:19:31.430 --> 07:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
by tomorrow morning early and the reason
 
07:19:34.190 --> 07:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
for that is I want to get it to the
 
07:19:36.530 --> 07:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
clerk they may decide to put it on our
 
07:19:39.890 --> 07:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
calendar for voting next week or not but
 
07:19:41.990 --> 07:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
at least we need to do it
 
07:19:44.628 --> 07:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
so if I could have that we will again
 
07:19:46.968 --> 07:19:46.978 align:start position:0%
temporarily suspend you do not leave the
 
07:19:50.090 --> 07:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
room until I get the report
 
07:19:50.100 --> 07:19:51.730 align:start position:0%
room until I get the report
um

07:19:51.730 --> 07:19:51.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:55.430 --> 07:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
for next week because it's an early bill
 
07:19:57.110 --> 07:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
um in
 
07:19:57.120 --> 07:19:58.090 align:start position:0%
um in
um

07:19:58.090 --> 07:19:58.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:02.090 --> 07:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes yes that's an early Bill
 
07:20:06.110 --> 07:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay may I request maybe this is
 
07:20:07.850 --> 07:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
impossible to do may I request the
 
07:20:10.250 --> 07:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to change my vote from yes
 
07:20:11.628 --> 07:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
to know I had no I thought I was the
 
07:20:13.430 --> 07:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
only one that was going to vote no
 
07:20:16.430 --> 07:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
and so I voted yes could I could we it's
 
07:20:18.230 --> 07:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
still Fair it still fails but it would
 
07:20:21.590 --> 07:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
just be I believe that's in order short
 
07:20:25.368 --> 07:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
of me looking it up in in Mason's uh or
 
07:20:28.150 --> 07:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
looking it up in Weber
 
07:20:31.548 --> 07:20:31.558 align:start position:0%
I I think we can have an informal we
 
07:20:34.730 --> 07:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
have often had informal revisions to
 
07:20:36.410 --> 07:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
that and there isn't a lot in Masons
 
07:20:38.868 --> 07:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
about committee work so what would that
 
07:20:41.090 --> 07:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
both be now if I changed it
 
07:20:44.810 --> 07:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
um it would be 14 to 7.
 
07:20:47.448 --> 07:20:47.458 align:start position:0%
okay that's still it okay does anybody
 
07:20:49.510 --> 07:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
have any objection to that the results
 
07:20:52.070 --> 07:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately will be the same and I didn't
 
07:20:55.070 --> 07:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
drop the hammer so this hearing still is
 
07:20:57.350 --> 07:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
not I mean this exact session is not
 
07:20:58.910 --> 07:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
over on this bill
 
07:21:02.090 --> 07:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
and I think that means it's okay but if
 
07:21:04.750 --> 07:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
it isn't let's all pretend it is
 
07:21:07.010 --> 07:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I have checked
 
07:21:08.570 --> 07:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
with the clerk and he said it is not an
 
07:21:08.580 --> 07:21:09.530 align:start position:0%
with the clerk and he said it is not an
order

07:21:09.530 --> 07:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
order
 
07:21:11.090 --> 07:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
what quirk
 
07:21:13.190 --> 07:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
oh Paul
 
07:21:16.548 --> 07:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
to change your changes since Mason isn't
 
07:21:16.558 --> 07:21:17.830 align:start position:0%
to change your changes since Mason isn't
around

07:21:17.830 --> 07:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
around
 
07:21:20.448 --> 07:21:20.458 align:start position:0%
reconsider in order
 
07:21:24.410 --> 07:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't believe it yes that would be
 
07:21:27.530 --> 07:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
an order it is an emotion to reconsider
 
07:21:29.448 --> 07:21:29.458 align:start position:0%
would have to come from somebody voting
 
07:21:32.150 --> 07:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
on the prison prevailing side so if
 
07:21:34.190 --> 07:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
somebody on the prevailing side is
 
07:21:36.350 --> 07:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
07:21:39.410 --> 07:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
um is willing to move to reconsider than
 
07:21:42.110 --> 07:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
we can I'll make a motion to reconsider
 
07:21:45.770 --> 07:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
you're on The Winning Side yes
 
07:21:49.190 --> 07:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay I just since I know where the
 
07:21:52.548 --> 07:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
procedures limitations reconsider a
 
07:21:52.558 --> 07:21:54.230 align:start position:0%
procedures limitations reconsider a
second

07:21:54.230 --> 07:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:21:54.240 --> 07:21:56.650 align:start position:0%
second
um

07:21:56.650 --> 07:21:56.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:00.468 --> 07:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
no we don't debate it again we could
 
07:22:02.810 --> 07:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
debate it again if we debate it again
 
07:22:05.390 --> 07:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
you don't you really don't want to I was
 
07:22:10.510 --> 07:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:13.910 --> 07:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so the motion to reconsider is
 
07:22:15.948 --> 07:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
coming from king and the second is
 
07:22:18.410 --> 07:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
Merchant now motion is coming from
 
07:22:20.570 --> 07:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
Merchant the second I'm not sure I think
 
07:22:24.490 --> 07:22:24.500 align:start position:0%

07:24:19.910 --> 07:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
wished to change his vote in the best
 
07:24:22.250 --> 07:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
way that can be done is for us to
 
07:24:25.690 --> 07:24:25.700 align:start position:0%
reconsider the original vote
 
07:24:29.090 --> 07:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
whereby he will be voting in a different
 
07:24:31.850 --> 07:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
way and that will be a courtesy and so
 
07:24:34.310 --> 07:24:34.320 align:start position:0%

all right thank you now it seems that in
 
07:33:31.128 --> 07:33:31.138 align:start position:0%
my beautiful wonderful there has to be a
 
07:33:32.510 --> 07:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
problem here somewhere but I haven't
 
07:33:35.570 --> 07:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
found it I've just been pointed out that
 
07:33:38.090 --> 07:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
there is an early bill that we have to
 
07:33:40.788 --> 07:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
look at to get out the door I'm sorry
 
07:33:43.190 --> 07:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
that was it you were all heading for
 
07:33:45.830 --> 07:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
your early dinner but representative
 
07:33:48.230 --> 07:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
Marsh would you please introduce it
 
07:33:51.830 --> 07:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
while I find it uh yes House Bill 314 is
 
07:33:55.070 --> 07:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
also an early Bill uh my opinion on
 
07:33:57.410 --> 07:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 314 is it's problematic it's
 
07:34:00.650 --> 07:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
drafted we also received an amendment uh
 
07:34:03.230 --> 07:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's still problematic one of
 
07:34:05.390 --> 07:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
the reasons it's problematic is that it
 
07:34:07.368 --> 07:34:07.378 align:start position:0%
includes food and drink and what it
 
07:34:09.410 --> 07:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
would allow and I believe that would
 
07:34:11.990 --> 07:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
include alcoholic beverages uh and
 
07:34:13.670 --> 07:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
probably that would be a violation of a
 
07:34:15.468 --> 07:34:15.478 align:start position:0%
number of laws so I think this bill is
 
07:34:17.750 --> 07:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time uh whether we
 
07:34:19.968 --> 07:34:19.978 align:start position:0%
want the itl or or retain it it's a
 
07:34:22.190 --> 07:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
matter for the committee to consider
 
07:34:24.530 --> 07:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
is this the
 
07:34:27.430 --> 07:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes I don't believe we exactly
 
07:34:30.850 --> 07:34:30.860 align:start position:0%
Homestead Homestead
 
07:34:33.650 --> 07:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
Homestead food operating advice here
 
07:34:37.128 --> 07:34:37.138 align:start position:0%

07:34:43.390 --> 07:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:47.270 --> 07:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
I have this report with the HTS that
 
07:34:47.280 --> 07:34:48.128 align:start position:0%
I have this report with the HTS that
says

07:34:48.128 --> 07:34:48.138 align:start position:0%
says
 
07:34:52.310 --> 07:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
if you'd like us to vote again no oh
 
07:34:55.670 --> 07:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
please God no no I have the yeah that's
 
07:34:58.490 --> 07:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
what I got it must be that the
 
07:35:00.350 --> 07:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
documentation we got from upstairs is
 
07:35:02.750 --> 07:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect and I apologize for that I was
 
07:35:04.250 --> 07:35:04.260 align:start position:0%

repentance means change of behavior not
 
07:37:54.890 --> 07:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
just remorse and I would suggest that at
 
07:37:57.230 --> 07:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
a future date we all have a pet of our
 
07:38:00.048 --> 07:38:00.058 align:start position:0%

07:38:21.830 --> 07:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:24.288 --> 07:38:24.298 align:start position:0%
I can mess my household pet don't say
 
07:38:25.910 --> 07:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
that in the committee with therapist and
 
07:38:29.110 --> 07:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:32.090 --> 07:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
recording too guys my husband isn't real
 
07:38:34.070 --> 07:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
pleased either he's starting to voice
 
07:38:36.730 --> 07:38:36.740 align:start position:0%
his opinion in the other room good
 
07:38:40.490 --> 07:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
please tell me if this is legal can I
 
07:38:44.150 --> 07:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
send an email to everybody if it's not
 
07:38:46.190 --> 07:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
about a bill
 
07:38:46.200 --> 07:38:48.230 align:start position:0%
about a bill
yes

07:38:48.230 --> 07:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:38:50.448 --> 07:38:50.458 align:start position:0%
yes like thousands of people we won
 
07:38:52.250 --> 07:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
money or something
 
07:38:55.570 --> 07:38:55.580 align:start position:0%
so you're inviting us to a party
 
07:38:59.810 --> 07:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
I'd love to do that but no it's uh uh
 
07:39:03.948 --> 07:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
there's a movement afoot to ask for the
 
07:39:06.190 --> 07:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
wend him voting
 
07:39:09.048 --> 07:39:09.058 align:start position:0%
Escapade whatever you want to call it to
 
07:39:11.150 --> 07:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
be studied
 
07:39:13.128 --> 07:39:13.138 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take a lot of support
 
07:39:16.430 --> 07:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
to make that happen okay I'm very
 
07:39:19.010 --> 07:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
concerned because my town uses the same
 
07:39:21.770 --> 07:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
software well it's not about a bill it's
 
07:39:24.230 --> 07:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
anybody's facing I I don't see it why
 
07:39:26.868 --> 07:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
not we will do it or not no problem I
 
07:39:28.610 --> 07:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
will say there have been other things
 
07:39:31.190 --> 07:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
that people have found to be tacky there
 
07:39:33.890 --> 07:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
was a member at one point who was
 
07:39:35.330 --> 07:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
sending out
 
07:39:38.230 --> 07:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
um uh advertisements for his business
 
07:39:41.930 --> 07:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
probably not a good thing but if if you
 
07:39:44.750 --> 07:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
just have a petition of some kind I I
 
07:39:46.548 --> 07:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
don't see that there's any problem with
 
07:39:46.558 --> 07:39:47.270 align:start position:0%
don't see that there's any problem with
that

07:39:47.270 --> 07:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:39:50.570 --> 07:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:53.810 --> 07:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
good night could I ask a quick question
 
07:39:57.110 --> 07:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
I could not find a paper copy of the of
 
07:40:00.468 --> 07:40:00.478 align:start position:0%
a bill I think it was 617 oh is it 607
 
07:40:02.868 --> 07:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
that we itl'd I want to look it up and
 
07:40:04.910 --> 07:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to be looking for
 
07:40:11.048 --> 07:40:11.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:15.890 --> 07:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
617-617 because the sponsor uh withdrew
 
07:40:17.448 --> 07:40:17.458 align:start position:0%
it and she said it was no longer
 
07:40:21.128 --> 07:40:21.138 align:start position:0%
necessary yeah the one that she said
 
07:40:24.410 --> 07:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
could it could be done without any
 
07:40:27.170 --> 07:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements well it's
 
07:40:29.448 --> 07:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
redundant wasn't it there was already it
 
07:40:31.070 --> 07:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
just could have been taken care of under
 
07:40:33.708 --> 07:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
existing statute she just didn't get to
 
07:40:35.810 --> 07:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
the right place it's going to be done
 
07:40:38.390 --> 07:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
through rules she'd talk HHS and and
 
07:40:41.628 --> 07:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right the rules yeah are
 
07:40:43.430 --> 07:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to accommodate a real good
 
07:40:46.310 --> 07:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
