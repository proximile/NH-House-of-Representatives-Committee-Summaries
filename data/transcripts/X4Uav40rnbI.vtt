interim study bills to look
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
at some people deem interim study is a
 
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
good way to keep the house from voting
 
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
on a bill they don't don't like they
 
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
refer to it as death With Dignity I
 
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
failed to see the dignity in it I take
 
00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
the phrase interim study very seriously
 
00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
it means we study it we have a chance to
 
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
look further at an issue at hand we come
 
00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 align:start position:0%
back here and we vote we don't vote the
 
00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 align:start position:0%
bill the Bill's gone we vote whether we
 
00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
recommend that the subject is worthy of
 
00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 align:start position:0%
further study or not worthy of further
 
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
study that's it but along the way good
 
00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
work product can be
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
produced such as House Bill
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
1269 um it is on the subject of
 
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
restraints timeout rooms things like
 
00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
that you remember representative maau uh
 
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
brought that bill to
 
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
us months
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
ago we saw strengths weaknesses some of
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
us have since seen a film on it we've
 
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
done a lot of in-depth study on it and I
 
00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
asked representative Petrino to chair
 
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
the interim study committee on this
 
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill he has produced a
 
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
masterful report if I didn't know better
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
I would guess he had been a high school
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
social studies teacher for 40
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
years I missed that La you know
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
that and his report
 
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
is a whole page
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
long and he asked me um would he get in
 
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
trouble for doing it and I said probably
 
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
but since I sign off on it we'll get in
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
trouble together because what it does is
 
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
those who read this report with a view
 
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
of filing
 
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
legislation you know whether we
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
recommend filing legislation or not you
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
can't stop them they're going to do it
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
if they want to they've got a lot of the
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
preliminary work done for them this is a
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
masterful report so you all should have
 
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.870 align:start position:0%
masterful report so you all should have
received

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.990 align:start position:0%
received
it

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
um there were two meetings of the
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
committee there was a special viewing of
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
a movie the kids we lose which after I
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
watched it I sent him a lengthy critique
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
of the movie which was largely negative
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh and it said it exactly followed his
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
views on it he thought it was an ad I
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
thought it was an ad for a company
 
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
wanting to provide a service that really
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
didn't understand kids act out for
 
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
numbers of reasons not just the reason
 
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
where their company could make a
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
difference I'm not saying their company
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a difference I am saying
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
that kids act out for a lot of other
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
reasons than what their company
 
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
believes um he's done further research
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
many of you have done further research
 
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
so I present to the committee on his
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
behalf uh his report um for those of you
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
who have not had the opportunity to read
 
00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
it I'll give you a chance to do so we'll
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
quickly

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
looks like just about everybody is
 
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
finished uh his
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation as you can see from the
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
bottom is on the one
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
hand um he believes the chapter 126 U
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
limiting the use of child restraint
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
practices in schools and treatments
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
facilities um was appropriate as we have
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
it however he saw that there may be
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
future legislation regarding cameras in
 
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.630 align:start position:0%
future legislation regarding cameras in
seclusion

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
seclusion
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
areas um
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
camera issues may need to be
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
uh looked at in legislation because of
 
00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
the opposing virtues of uh privacy on
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
the one hand and making sure that uh
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
testimony of that teacher beat up the
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
student is not verified by uh the camera
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
showing differently so there's that one
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
issue the whole issue of cameras and
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
investigations and also the possib
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
possibility that we may have a willing
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
School District or two to Pilot uh
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
different what might be considered best
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
practices uh before any further
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
legislature so his report is before you
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
um I will be submitting that as the
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee report if it is so
 
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.269 align:start position:0%
committee report if it is so
voted

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
um any discussion on the report which
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
will be his motion yet yes we recommend
 
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.470 align:start position:0%
will be his motion yet yes we recommend
further

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
hi representative
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
grossan thank you um chairman
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
Pearson um having done some work with
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
trying to get cameras on buses on
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
special education buses and um things
 
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:28.519 align:start position:0%
like that in the past I know that this
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
is important
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
work but there are also those privacy
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
issues and the ACLU was very active when
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
um the bus issue came up as well but one
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the overriding um messages of this I
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
think is the importance of best
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
practice and encouraging school
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
districts um to consider other methods
 
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
of you know
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
um methodologies to help work with our
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
kids and our populations that that need
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
this um and one of the main concerns I
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
believe for these kids is that a lot of
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
times these children are not kids that
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
can report back to
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
you I'm the parent of one of those
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
so it's our duty to protect our kids you
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
to keep privacy I do not believe in
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
putting cameras on teachers um as was
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
body cameras as was suggested um but I
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
think that this
 
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
report is like you said very well done
 
00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:52.990 align:start position:0%
report is like you said very well done
and

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I would recommend this report um with
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
the recommending of best practice
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
disuse um and possibly working with
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
individual school districts to work in
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
seclusion rooms the motion before us
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
will be simply do we recommend this
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
topic worthy of future
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
legislation I do yes anyone else wish to
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
report representative panck thank you
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson uh my son was a a loyal police
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
officer and when they first started
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
bringing in the cameras they did not
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
like the idea they are so grateful to
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
have these cameras because it avoids a
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
lot of unnecessary lawsuits so I think
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
this also
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
protects the teachers as well as the
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
students so I'm in favor of something
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
like this that's it thank you
 
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.749 align:start position:0%
like this that's it thank you
anyone

00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
bigford hey far away from his name
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
plate wait what is that right no uh well
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
unless you wish to be Perez uh no but
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's the next one up is Bickford you can
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
be Hispanic or you can go to L and be
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
French or you can be
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
Bickford yeah um when we left off on the
 
00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:30.519 align:start position:0%
bill I recall that uh most of us didn't
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
really want to go with the first part of
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
the bill which was about filming in the
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
classroom and then it moves on to the
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
filming in the uh solitary area uh which
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
I think was cordoned off or sequestered
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
classroom and I didn't have any problem
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
with that um is there any way the report
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
can say mention that because I didn't
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
think anybody wanted the classroom
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
camera so it would be misrepresentation
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
if we just broadly said yes this thing
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
should be uh completely passed we're not
 
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
recommending any of these things this is
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
his simply his committee report what we
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
are voting on is whether we think there
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
should be future legislation we are not
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
giving the content of the future
 
00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:18.069 align:start position:0%
giving the content of the future
legislation

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
itself future legislation on the whole
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
thing would be no but on part of it yes
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
am I missing something yeah you're
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
missing the breadth don't overthink this
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
don't overd detail this should there be
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
we recommend future legislation of
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
whatever on this subject of restraints
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
or should there be no um future
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
legislation on the subject we're not
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
saying the details oh okay the
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation is yes to Future
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
legislation or no that's all we've got
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're not vote rev voting the bill the
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
bill is gone he's discussing that's I
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
know but somebody's going to pick up and
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
utilize it to get through why not
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
somebody can say to the contrary look
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
look they they've agreed to use cameras
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
in the classroom who did nobody has
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
no no it's not what this is this is
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
interim study it's not committee voting
 
00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:18.519 align:start position:0%
on a bill the Bill's
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
gone okay okay representative uh
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
grossen just to speak to what
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford they do
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
recommend to what you were saying about
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
how the discussion of not Universal
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
classrooms but that it's
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
designated one compromise one possible
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
compromise may be to permit cameras only
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
in designated seclusion areas that's in
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
the end of his I think that's what
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to right yes okay there
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
is a recommendation within that maybe
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
not representative D
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I fear that we're going to lose
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
the the act of which we are um
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
commissioned to do in this
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
case um we are to here decide whether
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
this committee report is conducive to us
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
stating and only stating to refer for
 
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.230 align:start position:0%
stating and only stating to refer for
future

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
legislation whatever that legislation
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
may or may not be will be decided in a
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing and vote at that time
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're not in this report trying to tell
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
anybody that they should create
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
legislation and if they decide to do so
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
what that legislation May
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
mean my reason
 
00:17:54.149 --> 00:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
for um agreeing to interim study I had
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
many one of them was there was no fiscal
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
note on the bill we
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
cannot go against our
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh 21A 21 28a oh 28 which
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
is no funding no
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
mandate I it would have been an unfunded
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
mandate for the state to say you shall
 
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.070 align:start position:0%
mandate for the state to say you shall
have

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
cameras that was the first thing that I
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
had a problem with the second thing that
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
I had a problem with was putting cameras
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
in various areas of a classroom of a
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
school May envelop kids who are just the
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
average student doing nothing wrong
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
going from one classroom to the next and
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
it may or may not be
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
useful the other thing that was never
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
discussed is the kids
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
who would benefit from a video of their
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
situation at the moment that caused them
 
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
to go there yet the bill itself didn't
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
speak to that and those kids may be
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
nonverbal they may be verbal but not
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
able to express themselves at the moment
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
so forth and so on so there were too
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
many conundrums as I saw it and that's
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
why I thought interim study would help
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
during the
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
study my questions really went
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
unanswered so if there is future
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that's not what we're
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
deciding today we're saying sure why not
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to do it let them do
 
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
it and we will debate that once the
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
legislation is written so this is pretty
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
much a synopsis of our many meetings
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
concerning the subject um and and we
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
were all wholeheartedly in agreement
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
with uh representative
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
petrino's uh report so that's all I I
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
hope I helped
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
you you understand where this report is
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
really going it's not going for to
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
suggest future legislation it's pretty
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
much saying sure if you want new
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
legislation have it we'll debate it at
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
that time if you don't no
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
problem any further discussion on the
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
report chair would entertain a motion to
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%

um be one of them has to is a is the
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
report that has to go in officially I
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
don't know whether there's one that's a
 
00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:00.039 align:start position:0%
keeper in the folder but whatever the
 
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
clerk does to say we've just passed
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
something okay that ends our work on
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
1269 um we go next to
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
1590 and open the work on that that is
 
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.430 align:start position:0%
1590 and open the work on that that is
relative

relative to the training regarding child
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
1590 and representative long I believe
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
you chaed that
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh I did and uh you looking
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
for a motion
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking no at first I'm looking
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
for a discussion so your report and uh
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
does everyone have a copy of his report
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.470 align:start position:0%
 
them

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.990 align:start position:0%
them
three

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
four and one for the kitty I'll give the
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
kitty the one one for the
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
so if I may uh yes please make your
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
report so so there was a group um what
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
what first got me to bring this uh Bill
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
forward was uh there was a group working
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
on something like this outside of us uh
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
they had called me um actually was two
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
or three days prior to you deadline for
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
submitting bills and I agreed to sub
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
submit a bill that just made sense to me
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
um as we had the hearing uh there was
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
some confusion on uh training um there
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
was also some mention of
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
um some of the uh like some of the
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics had concern about who would
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
be responsible for overseeing this um
 
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
those those were all questions that were
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
put in the air that we weren't ready to
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
qu to answer those questions that's why
 
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh I recommended the interim study uh
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
and it and in that there's
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
um there's still
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
some work that needs to be done
 
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
on whether this goes to your license
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
whether this is just a legislative
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
change um where we would require it what
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
would be the
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
um what would be the
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
training um how would you be able to
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
access that who would be responsible
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
again for overseeing this um and who
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
would be required actually I got an
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
email from another entity and I can't
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
recall them off hand that also wants to
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
be included in the training um they want
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
their people an association that wanted
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
their people to be included in this
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
training um
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
yeah was it's pretty basic uh I'm what
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to move whatever the Motions
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
needed is recommended for other
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislation okay anyone wish to speak to
 
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
representative Long's
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
presentation representative McMahon
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank youman representative specific to
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
the that you provided us um when it
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
states the minimum pH of positions only
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
taking the available training within
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
that available training is there none
 
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.029 align:start position:0%
 
identifying

00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
abuse well at this time is yeah they
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not necessarily abuse there's
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
training available now and there's a
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
minimum of uh Physicians that are
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
currently taking them
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
not not saying that those that aren't
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
taking it are bad uh we don't know what
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
that reason is all we've identified is
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's a minimum that are taken it and
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
then one followup follow up okay then
 
00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
just within the bill when it states
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
voluntary versus required that's what
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
you want to have additional legislation
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
on is requiring correct that would
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
include specificity correct on the
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
subject matter yep correct thank you any
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Nelson I
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
don't have a question I just had some
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson for a statement uh
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
I um we heard feedback that um you know
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
doctors learn about um what the
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
definition of child abuse is on in
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
medical school and training that they
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
have um when they're preparing to be on
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
their own as a doctor and I think that
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
something uh some piece of legislation
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be established because um as we
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
know you know the different definitions
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
of abuse um vary across the states we
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't know um where these people have
 
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
gotten their medical training and also
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
um continuing education because
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
legislation continues to change so um
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know I was really really um deeply
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
affected by the testimony of the two
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
doctors who told us about two infants
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
who were
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
um who were Chang changed for life
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
because the first time the abuse wasn't
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
reported and if it was reported maybe
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
there would be different outcomes for
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
those children so um I think that it's
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
really important that we continue to
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
um figure out what type of wording we're
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
going to use in legislation so that we
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
can have this happen any other Committee
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
Member representative
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
Grossman thank you chairman
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
Pearson um I absolutely think that this
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
should uh be recommended for further
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
legislation um but I received some
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
information from that group that there
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
is a potential pathway and it's through
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
lure um and if I can just read for
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
suggested future legislation
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire chapter of the
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics has
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
written a letter requesting that
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
education as outlined in HB 1590 be
 
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.630 align:start position:0%
education as outlined in HB 1590 be
mandat

00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
mandat
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
and this has been supported by the New
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Academy of family
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
practitioners there is already an
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
established pathway by which such
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
training could be made a mandatory
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
condition for lure this is how training
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
in opioid prescribing was made
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
compulsory several years
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
ago um despite the meeting with the
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine the Board of Nursing
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
and the office of Prof professional lure
 
00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:25.470 align:start position:0%
and the office of Prof professional lure
and

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
certification these entities have not
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
taken action yet so there is a way a
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
pathway and the subtleties what we're
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
hearing right now
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
about babies with broken bones the
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
subtleties that can happen in a
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
conversation where a
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
pediatrician a nurse needs special
 
00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519 align:start position:0%
training to be able to identify I mean
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
these are close held secrets in a family
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
um so if the possibility of going
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
through lure for future legislation um
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
because this is
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
important training that needs to happen
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
I believe thank
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
you anyone else in the committee
 
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.990 align:start position:0%
you anyone else in the committee
representative

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
dmoney thank you Mr chairman I too agree
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
that uh all medical professionals should
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
be well trained in the area of um
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing child abuse uh and being
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
aware of their New Hampshire state
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
laws in so far as what we
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
consider uh child abuse many many
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
Physicians come to our state and
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
thankfully so and they are aware of
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
other states um regulations on child
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
abuse and what constitutes child's abuse
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
and what does not uh so I think this
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
training could only assist assist those
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
Physicians I think that one of the
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
issues in that I had well I don't think
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
I know that one of the issues that I had
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
in this bill is it wasn't specific
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
enough as to what that training would be
 
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
in so far as there are so many um
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
trainings out there and many entities
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
offer training we needed to I believe be
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
more specific as to the criteria that
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
that should be met in this law as to the
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
training that Physicians Physicians
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
assistants and any other medical staff
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
should Avail themselves of uh so it it
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of words to say that it's
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
very simple to recommend this for future
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
legislation but be more
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
specific that's all I'm asking for thank
 
00:31:55.389 --> 00:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman is there yes
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford um yeah I I feel
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
the same exact way as representative D
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
Simon um there was a lot of hours that
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
doctors's going to spend according to
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
the bill um learning about something
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
over and over again it was a repe their
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
training was
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
repetitious and um I I know I've never
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
been to a doctor's office that they
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
weren't concerned about any kind of
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
abuse including including me you know
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
are you safe at home those things um
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
so and I feel the
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's end run around the regulatory
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
process that we we do through uh 551a I
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
think you know give the authority to
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory um
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh setting the standards and such by
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
them if we don't think to doing it right
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
then we do the end run and make
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
legislation over and above their uh
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
regulations and I just didn't hear any
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
of that I
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
mean do we even hear from can't remember
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
if we hear we usually hear from
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth but I'm not convinced that the
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
regulatory process is broke down and
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
when I when I am and that is the right
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
time to
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
overstep the uh regul regulatory uh
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
boards in fact I I saw a lot of stuff
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
coming in this year that was just
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
plucked out of the
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
regulations and uh waste of time
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm not in in favor of going forward
 
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.350 align:start position:0%
so I'm not in in favor of going forward
with

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
it representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
chairman and I'm sorry I'm a little out
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
of practice I don't think I said Thank
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman when I made my last you
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
buy a book of five and thank me
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
profusely several times and then you're
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
good for the rest of the day how's that
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and I apologize again to
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
the committee too sorry about that um
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
while I agree with what representative
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
Bickford is saying um and you know
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
certainly we you know want to make less
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
laws than more
 
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.430 align:start position:0%
laws than more
laws

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
um we did hear about
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
um children being hurt or
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
killed and I don't want to sit and wait
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
for another year or two or three years
 
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.589 align:start position:0%
for another year or two or three years
to

00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
see if self-re ulation is going to
 
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.589 align:start position:0%
see if self-re ulation is going to
change

00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
that anyone else on the committee second
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
bite of the Apple representative D
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you again Mr chairman and
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
and I apologize um for if anybody thinks
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
this is a waste of time um my daughter
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
is a or was for 12 years a pediatric
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
nurse uh at Children's Hospital in
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
Boston my da is hearing
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
impaired my daughter was in the
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
emergency room one day when parents came
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
in with a an
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
infant and the infant was um on its
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
route to being diagnosed with failure to
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
thrive when my daughter being hearing
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
imped and that's why it's relevant to
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
this um discussion she was watching over
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
at the parents and she reads
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
lips she saw one parent telling the
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
other parent gez I wonder if um they're
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
going to be able to find out that uh
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
I've been doing cocaine a lot even
 
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
though I'm breastfeeding
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
him so anybody who knows much about
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
cocaine is when you put it in your mouth
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
um your mouth goes
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
numb and that was one of the reasons
 
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
that this child could not
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
suckle the child was now or the infant
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
was now losing weight because the infant
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
could not suckle they tried to bottle
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah so my daughter saw saw
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
this and she looked over at the doctor
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
and she said can I see you outside for a
 
00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
minute please they went outside the room
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
she said can we do a toxicology on that
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
baby and the doctor said why would we do
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
that I didn't prescribe anything I don't
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
see anything in the record of this baby
 
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
receiving any medication she said could
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
you please just do it the doctor typical
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
of most doctors listened to the nurse MH
 
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.910 align:start position:0%
of most doctors listened to the nurse MH
and

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
said why not I can't figure anything out
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
know doctors practice nurses do will do
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
it they did it they found cocaine in the
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
baby system it was child abuse the
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
baby's life was saved my point is that
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's you know we put doctors and in most
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
cases rightfully so on such a high
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
pedestal and they deserve it in most
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
cases but they're
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
human and maybe an update of this is
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
abuse that's abuse the other thing is
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
abuse will help the doctors I don't see
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
this as punishing a doctor or trying to
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
take time out of a doctor's life I see
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
it as assisting a doctor to do the job
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
that they honestly want to do as well as
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
they can possibly do it would have there
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
have been no normal protocol call when
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
an infant presents with failure to
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
thrive to do a talk screen not always
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
from what I hear um they go through
 
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
multiple steps in the treatment of the
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
infant and that could be a part of it
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not a doctor so I couldn't tell you
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
but I do know that it my daughter seeing
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
what that person said And discussing it
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
physician um created a situation where
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
the child wouldn't have to go through
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
enough or or too many tests and so forth
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
and so on and luckily the one test that
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
they did which
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
was less invasive than many others
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
worked but again I just think that
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
doctors nurses
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
Pas uh and and so forth they work so
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
well together it's it's a great thing
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
but again they're human they something
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
could be missed and we can't afford
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
to be laxidasical about that and just
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
say it is what it is we have to at least
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
afford them the ability in their um
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
retraining uh every so many years and
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
they do have to um to do some of that
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
every so many years every year every
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
year or and in this case it would be
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
every two years they have to do it
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
anyway this can be just incorporated in
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
one of those training sessions is all
 
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:01.589 align:start position:0%
one of those training sessions is all
I'm

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
saying I'm going to take the authority
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the chair has
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
and ask if there is anyone in the
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
audience who would make no more than
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
three minute
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
presentation in favor of our
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
recommending for further legislation you
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
get three minutes no more don't Deep
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
dive just give us
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
State who you are and what your
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
credentials are if you wish you don't
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
have to do that anyone wish to do that
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
this good morning Mr chairman my name is
 
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
Wendy Gladstone I am a retired child
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
abuse pediatrician I'm one of the
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
people who came to you last January with
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
suggestions for this
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
legislation um we recognize that house
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
bill 1590 is not going to go anywhere um
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
but we feel very strongly that
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed to address this
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
problem as pointed out Physicians nurse
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
practitioners and physician assistants
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
want to do the right thing but many of
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
them do not understand how to evaluate a
 
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
child for the Poss ability of abuse they
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't know that we provide in this State
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
247 help from a system of Specialists
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
who can help them out when they get
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
stuck um they don't understand how the
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
laws in New Hampshire work even if they
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
were trained in this state but certainly
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
because many of them were trained
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
elsewhere as has been pointed out since
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
the original proposal of House Bill 1590
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
there has been written a 2hour
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
self-paced online free continuing
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
education course for Physicians and
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
nurses and physician assistants which
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
gives them the credit they would need to
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
have two hours completed every two years
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth is willing to give to the
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
office of professional Li Insurance
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
certification notification of which
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
people have completed that training um
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a system in place for it to
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
all happen it wouldn't cost a medical
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
provider anything and it would be part
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
of the education that already require to
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
have however we've had this propos we've
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
had this course available we've sent out
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
announcements to 5,000 providers and 60
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
of them have taken the course so clearly
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some sort of impetus
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
to get more people trained in this and
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
needed have you approached oplc with a
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
presentation suggesting that through
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
licensing um something is more than
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
encouraged yes we spoke to the office of
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
professional lure they deferred to the
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and the Board of
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
Nursing the Board of Medicine and the
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing have not taken action
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that we presented to
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
them with the same information we
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
presented to you which is that children
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
are being injured and are suffering and
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
in some extreme cases dying because it's
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
not recognized that they're being abused
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
and they're being returned to abusive
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
environments uh representative Gman for
 
00:42:34.359 --> 00:42:36.589 align:start position:0%
environments uh representative Gman for
the

00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
witness thank you chairman Pearson um so
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
would you suggest that that two-hour
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
training going forward maybe for next
 
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
session since we already have an online
 
00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
training it's just getting providers to
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
take it to access it if they're required
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
through lure
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
they'll take it is that a
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
suggestion that you would make or that
 
00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.069 align:start position:0%
suggestion that you would make or that
specific

00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
training our recommendation would be
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
that there be a requirement for two
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
hours of training that's accredited
 
00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
meaning that it follows evidence-based
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
practice and that it covers the topics
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
important when I go to my family
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
practice physician for my annual
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
physical I consider what I'm given is
 
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
substandard not because of the training
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
of the practitioner not because of her
 
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:43.559 align:start position:0%
sincerity because she tells me she has a
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
limited amount of time she shall use no
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
more than that unless I
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
code might I suggest that another place
 
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.270 align:start position:0%
code might I suggest that another place
to

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
attack is those for-profit medical
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
facilities that say to Young doctors who
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
will practice with these huge groups
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
because they've got to pay off their
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
student loans that maybe a 15minute
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
visit for something or a 45 minute
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
annual physical is malpractice on its
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
face and it may not be allowed in this
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
state um the only reason I get good
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
Medical Care is because I'm part-time
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
CEO of a medical facility by law my wife
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
cannot treat me so I go outside and I
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
have changed doctors several times and
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
when I say to them you know this is not
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
enough their response is we
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
know and maybe certain things that are
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
missed wouldn't be missed if they were
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to treat the patient the way the
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
patient needs to be treated and not the
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
way the people sign the check demand
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
they do it
 
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere that might be a line of attack
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
because people who don't spend much time
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
miss things that they were trained to
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
see so if they're going to look for this
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
what don't they look
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
for um thank you for your testimony does
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
anyone have a question to the
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
witness saying none thank you again I'm
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
it is important that Physicians nurse
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
practitioners and Physicians assistants
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
with direct contact with those of tender
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
age know the signs to look for having
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
done a spot check of medical schools I
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
can tell you that this is on the
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum everywhere I looked having
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
done a spot check with Physicians nurse
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
practitioners I've not spoken to any
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
physician assistant I can tell you that
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
without exception each person has been
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
trained in what to look
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
for um that they've received the
 
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
training that they don't need further
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
training they also indicate and believe
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
me I live in a house with this there are
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
required CMEs continuing medication
 
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.950 align:start position:0%
required CMEs continuing medication
medical

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
education hours each year lots of them
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
which one is you going to drop in order
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
to put this one in are you going to to
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
add two more
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
hours to people who already come home
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
tired from a long
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
shift and now face more medical
 
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
education credits that have to be done
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
by a certain time where will these extra
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
hours come from it's not a matter of
 
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
money it's a matter of time and
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
extremely busy and very tired and
 
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.870 align:start position:0%
extremely busy and very tired and
overworked

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
overworked
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
people a
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
physician serving in the New Hampshire
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives said to me that
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
a the Hampshire based study indicated
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
that while further training might
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
improve knowledge about recording
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
requirements there is no evidence that
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
this actually happened that the number
 
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
of reportings actually went up when
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
another group of people took continuing
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
ed in other words if it made a
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
difference it didn't show up in the data
 
00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
another physician wondered if there was
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
training in existence that has a
 
00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.270 align:start position:0%
training in existence that has a
demonstrated

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrated
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
evidence-based Effectiveness in other
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
words sounds good where it has been done
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.470 align:start position:0%
is it
working

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
um I wrote down here doctors should be
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
required or should
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
be people employing Physicians should
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to let doctors do SUB
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
standard care
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
because of the clock maybe that is the
 
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
approach maybe more would be seen and
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
not missed if they could have the time
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
to look
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
over um so for that reason I am a no on
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
this I think a lot of good stuff has
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
been brought up I don't think the
 
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
problem lies with
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
legislation uh unless the legislation
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
has to do with hours a doct or minutes a
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
doctor is allowed to see somebody is
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
there anybody in the audience who would
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
this okay so that's my Minority Report
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote no not because
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
of I don't care but because I don't
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
think this is the way to do
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
do representative law talk me out of it
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
yeah well I'm not going to talk you out
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
of it but my 18 years as a State Rep
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
this I've seen this all too often the
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
two the two the two constituents that
 
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
two the two the two constituents that
get

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
sideline are elders and
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
infants and I'm hearing you know there
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
they already busy they got the extra
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
hours those are the people that could
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
speak but we also heard
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
that children are dying children are
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
being abused more uh because of no um we
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
haven't identified it whe whether they
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to or not um so I you know I mean
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm even looking at this curriculum
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
to you know how do I deal with
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
detectives how do I deal with the child
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
advocate Center how do I deal you know
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
those could all make it easier for or um
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
for a doctor you know cuz okay if I
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
report this I'm going to get a call from
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
these three entities how do I deal with
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
them so there's there's time I'm
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
spending on that um so I think there's a
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
way with which we could
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
um be assured that they're all trained
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the way we believe they ought to be
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
trained and that belief would be in a
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
quicker uh quicker addressing um uh for
 
00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
the child development purposes uh that
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
the child's being neglected or
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
abused let me let me dialogue with you
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
if I may um some of the children that we
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a pediatric practice but we
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
do have young adults who come in who are
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
in homes with their
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
parents and we have
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
seen abuse and duly reported
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
it and as we looked at our records we
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
discovered we haven't seen this person
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
in 3
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
years and the abuse could have happened
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
in that period of time and let's say
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
that person didn't come in 3 years later
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
but abuse started in because the person
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
didn't come in didn't come in didn't
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
come in didn't come in and now there is
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
abuse it sure ain't the doctor's fault
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
in this case so I am wondering if the
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
scope is not J that Physicians need to
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
be trained but football coaches and band
 
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:27.799 align:start position:0%
Masters and other people who in the
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
schools may have more contact with
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
children and are more much more likely
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
to see abuse and neglect than a
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
physician who might see the kid annually
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
if we're lucky would you suggest that
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
that's a uh broadening where we to go to
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
Future legislation yeah I I I think what
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're addressing is uh medical experts
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
people that are in the health industry
 
00:51:56.599 --> 00:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
people that are in the health industry
coaches

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
coaches
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
aren't um other people aren't so I I you
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
know so I so I'm not uh I mean I I don't
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
believe that's debatable it's it's you
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
know and a further if further you want
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
to set up some training for coaches go
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
for it uh I'm looking at the touch and
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
base on uh the medical experts um that's
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm looking to gain here at
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
the very
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
least well with two people not of my
 
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
political iCal party but have MDS at the
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
end of their name um telling me they
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
don't see the value of this but they do
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
see um other people with much more
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
regular children contact I wonder if
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is going any effort that's going
 
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
into this is going in the right
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
direction so that's just my response
 
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.670 align:start position:0%
direction so that's just my response
representative

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
Grossman can I pass my turn to
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson who was so but to
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
piggy back I'll just she had her hand
 
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
up to piggy back on what representative
 
00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
long was
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
saying representative uh chairman peon
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
the sources you went to were
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
Physicians those are the people were
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
asking were requiring this training of
 
00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.990 align:start position:0%
asking were requiring this training of
so

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:28.799 align:start position:0%
in both cases they retired this would
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
not be for them but what about the
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
kids and I agree and we're not talking
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
about a broke you
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
know abuse we're talking about lives
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh-huh kids that die mhm I agree so if
 
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
we know that there is training that
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
we know that child and
 
00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
exists why would we not want to do
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
everything in our power to prevent
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
it I would want to suggest that I have
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
we had did not see any data that would
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
say for
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
example when it was discovered this
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
child had been
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
abused some of the broken bones clearly
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
years and the child had been seen by a
 
00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.990 align:start position:0%
years and the child had been seen by a
medical

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
provider during that period therefore
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
they missed it versus this broken bone
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
is 2 or three years old and there was no
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
record of this child having gotten
 
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
medical assistance during that period in
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
other words I want to see what is the
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
the extent
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
of the problem being medical providers
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
missing something when it wasn't in
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
front of them to miss or see because
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise we are saying they in this
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
case missed it they didn't have an it to
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
miss But the teacher did the coach did
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying representative
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman um actually
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
this is a good segue into what I was um
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
planning to say my husband is a hockey
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
coach um my son is involved in a hockey
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
program that is a part of USA Hockey my
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
husband has to take several hours of
 
00:55:44.349 --> 00:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
units uh of uh training and education on
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things safety within the
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
sport um identifying abuse
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
um etc etc um every year every year to
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
be recertified as a coach for USA Hockey
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
so personally I do not think it is over
 
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.029 align:start position:0%
so personally I do not think it is over
and

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:06.039 --> 00:56:08.069 align:start position:0%
and
Beyond

00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
Beyond
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
what um what should be expected for a
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
doctor to spend two hours every two
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
child um we know that there are several
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
advocates see groups that are
 
00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:34.039 align:start position:0%
also asking for additional mandated
 
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
cus to prevent other horrible
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
things and I am
 
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.230 align:start position:0%
things and I am
suggesting

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
um how many hours of
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
ceu should be mandated more than what we
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
have now because these others that I've
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
heard have made a good case face
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
too representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
chairman um the what uh represent Nelson
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
said is it's not is required by a
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
certification which is a regulatory
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
board as I pointed out okay and not by
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
law so you know that coaching stuff is
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
done without a law MH and I'm concerned
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
that we're not utilizing the the
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory boards or those that are want
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing more hours which are
 
00:57:35.549 --> 00:57:35.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes arbitrary are they actually do
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
you really need that much I don't know
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
so why would I legislate it you let the
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
people in the know that have the
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge to to do the regulations and
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of a board
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative long uh thank you Mr
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
chairman so the bottom line here is we
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the people present we need to
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
talk to that's the insurance companies
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay because the time allotted to
 
00:57:59.549 --> 00:57:59.559 align:start position:0%
doctors the insurance says here's what
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
time you got all right and they're not
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
here represented so the bottom line here
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
is a matter of the best interest of the
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
child the best in their development uh
 
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.069 align:start position:0%
child the best in their development uh
and

00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
not and not asking them because the B
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
not asking them how much time they have
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
because it's the insurance companies
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
that have given them that time would you
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
Advocate criminalizing Insurance
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
companies oh
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
yeah represent resentative D Simone
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I I'm going to
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
align a little bit more bottom than uh
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative long and here's the
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
bottom line as far as I see this leg
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
future legislation this is not
 
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that is geared
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
discipline a
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
physician this is not an attack on a
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
physician's knowledge
 
00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:57.910 align:start position:0%
physician's knowledge
or

00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
capabilities this is simply because in
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
we all know that our laws change
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
frequently specifically could change on
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
an annual basis now if we find that this
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
issue is child abuse this
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
year and a physician doesn't have the
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
time and I'm going to go into the time
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
element to check
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
online all the laws that we have passed
 
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
passed this twoyear update will assist
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
the physician that I have full
 
00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:45.039 align:start position:0%
confidence wants to do the job well they
 
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
want to have the information necessary
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
to protect their patients this
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
legislation if it is done correctly in
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
could assist the Physicians not attack
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
them I I don't believe that any
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
physician is out there to not do their
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
job I think that this is going to enable
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
them to do their job better I I just
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
think that we have lost five children in
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
the past couple of years due
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
to neglectful abuse on other
 
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
aspects uh on through state
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
agencies not through doctors they're
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
trying and I think they need our help
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
and I think a 2hour update every two
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
years may
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
be difficult for them but I don't think
 
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
it's too much to ask when we could have
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
a child live beyond the age of three or
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
five which is two of the specific deaths
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we've had in the last two years so
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's why I I don't see the harm in
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
else representative sidel thank you Mr
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um I just wanted to add um I
 
01:01:21.029 --> 01:01:21.039 align:start position:0%
was in a Christian band for 13 years you
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
were where in a Christian band for 13
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
years in my church okay one of the
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
requir ments for me to remain in the
 
01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:29.799 align:start position:0%
band and all of us in the band was every
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
year we had to take a an abuse course so
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
we could recognize abuse and how to deal
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
with children in order to just sing
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
voluntarily um so this I see as one more
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox to help our
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
physicians not hinder them that's all I
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
