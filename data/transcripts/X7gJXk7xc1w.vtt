00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.030 align:start position:0%
 
let

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 align:start position:0%
I guess so that that is truez did I G to
 
00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
say look at you okay it's uh 9:15
 
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
roughly uh give or take a few moments um
 
00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
we're here today for the first part of
 
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
today's work to look and to work on it
 
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee on HB
 
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
1517 that's a bill relative to the
 
00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax
 
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
commonly known as swep and excess
 
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
revenue from games of chance and we have
 
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Harrington here and
 
00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
along with folks from the uh Dr uh
 
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration so uh I'd like to
 
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
have uh represent Harrington f up first
 
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
and we can have you know a a work
 
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
session together on this um uh perhaps
 
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
the best thing to start this out
 
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
represent Harrington if you could give
 
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 align:start position:0%
us a brief overview of what the intent
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
the bill is yeah uh first of all let me
 
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
again apologize for missing the public
 
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
hearing I thought this was going
 
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 align:start position:0%
directly the ways and means but I guess
 
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 align:start position:0%
if it says anything about Statewide
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
education property tax it automatically
 
00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 align:start position:0%
comes here um the inten of the bill is
 
00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
pretty simple I think anybody who's um
 
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
been paying attention to what's going on
 
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or watches the six o00
 
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
news for example every night there's
 
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
more and more ads for casinos uh we just
 
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
saw in yesterday's paper a new casino
 
00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 align:start position:0%
was just approved in Conway and we're
 
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
not talking you casinos of 20 or 30
 
00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
years ago we're talking thousands of
 
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
well they call them historical horse
 
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
racing but they're effectively slot
 
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
machines uh the table Stakes are going
 
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
up to $50 now which is a big increase
 
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
from where it was back a few years ago
 
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
and like I say these are Big commercial
 
00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 align:start position:0%
establishments and they have to be
 
00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
associated with the charity but the
 
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
amount of gambling revenue is going to
 
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
be going way way up and my goal of the
 
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
Bill of this bill is to Simply say let's
 
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
not use the increase in gambling revenue
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
is an excuse to increase or grow
 
00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
government because you can use the
 
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
example from the state of New Hampshire
 
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
back um some 10 12 years ago uh they had
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
put in gambling down there I think
 
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
everybody remembers all the ads on TV
 
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
for the casinos and there was actually I
 
00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 align:start position:0%
hadn't gone but I've known people who
 
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
went and there were people lined up two
 
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
three four deep waiting in line just to
 
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
get to a blackjack table and the
 
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
revenues went way way up and then the
 
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 align:start position:0%
recession came and the revenues went
 
00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
down along with you know other tax
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
revenues in the state and they ended up
 
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
putting in big new increases in taxes
 
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
because they had expanded a bunch of
 
00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
programs with this new Revenue thinking
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
it was just going to come forever and
 
00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
you know I know over the next few years
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to see this big increase in
 
00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
revenues but it it will flatten out
 
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
because it eventually it'll get
 
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
saturated and you'll just be the demand
 
00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 align:start position:0%
for gambling will be fulfilled it's not
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
insatiable so the problem is though we
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
establish new government programs they
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
generally don't do that they keep
 
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
growing and growing and then they they
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
justify their existence by finding more
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
reasons for them to grow and that causes
 
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
of course the need for more tax revenue
 
00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this bill is to just
 
00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
not allow that to happen um like I said
 
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
I thought it was going to go to ways and
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
means I'm not an expert on uh taxes uh
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
by any stretch of the imagination it
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that the Statewide property
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
tax was the uh education property tax
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
was the best one to go after because
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
everybody pays that one way or the other
 
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
on the property tax bill even if you
 
00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
rent your landlords paying that for you
 
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
so decreasing that would save people
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
money um but I've also me talked to some
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
other people that are more knowledgeable
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
than I am and one of the other
 
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
suggestions was that you could use it
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
for something like paying down the state
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
retirement obligation which I which is
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
very very large I know we did some of
 
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
that last year but um uh that would also
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
help everybody because it makes the
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
credit ratings better and it saves the
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
cities and towns money and so forth so
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's just another possibility what I'm
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
trying to say here is the goal is to
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
make sure the new gambling revenues
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
aren't used to expand the government and
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
someone more knowledgeable than me on
 
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
the best way to do that I'd certainly be
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
more than willing to listen and sit down
 
00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
with them so thank you that's about
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
it are there any questions that we may
 
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 align:start position:0%
have as a committee that uh represent
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
Harrington might be able to
 
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
answer yes represent cordelli thank you
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for coming in
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
this morning um just wondering where the
 
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
from that's online
 
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
12 I believe that was
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's what ALS I believe came up
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
with that number it wasn't mine is um um
 
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
that was put into the bill because it's
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
that was what with the present level was
 
00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you H how does the Dr going to
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
how are they going to estimate the
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
amount that be that and the timing for
 
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
the revenues to go into the
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
weep is that a question for I think
 
00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
that's better answered by them I mean
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
all I what I was trying to do was set a
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
time frame where I'm assuming since the
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
the revenue is coming in and we know
 
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
where it's coming from that giv a date
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
we should be able to say any revenues in
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
excess of the amount collected
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
previously would be put into this new
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
bucket and but I'll I'll I'll leave that
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
to the revenue folks who have know more
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
about it than I do so with that we do
 
00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 align:start position:0%
have Dr here and I think a lot of the
 
00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 align:start position:0%
issues were going to have regarding the
 
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
timing and and and this amount of money
 
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
along with the 6.6 million um so if
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
there no more questions of represent
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
Harrington let's invite up Dr to help us
 
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
out with some of the timing and all this
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:35.629 align:start position:0%
 
least

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%

a position on this bill however um the

in terms of um administering the uh uh
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
the bill uh as identified by the
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
questions from uh representative L that
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
um first off is the the timing um so one
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
of the issues that we've identified uh
 
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
let me just go down here from what we
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
does everybody have that n Department of

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
guide okay that's what we might be
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
right some of the questions are internal
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
yes so the the the first thing that that
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
we we wanted we that we identify is the
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
the concern is that the bill doesn't
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
stipulate the the date range in terms of
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
the payment deposit into the ETF um so
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh it does say that okay the amounts
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
that's from the gambling uh Revenue goes
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
into the ETF and then anything in excess
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
of the $6.6 million is going to be used
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
to deduct against the uh the 363 million
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
uh swept warant
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
calculation however
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
um the the bill is not clear in terms of
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
um the date range in terms of uh when
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
when to from when to when that the
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
revenue would be considered the gambling
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
Revenue would be considered in terms of
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
the the math to calculate the uh to
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
deduct the $6.6 million um in addition
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
to that um we also uh we're not certain
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
as to at which stage the revenue
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
reporting uh for the gambling winnings
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
would be considered would it be at the
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
act for reporting level or or a cash
 
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
basis level um or would it be something
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
that would be identified To Us by State
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
Treasury or from uh gaming commission or
 
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
something like that it it it probably
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
would be more straightforward if they uh
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
did that amount is certified to us and
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
then we can just use that number and
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
deduct the $6.6 million or if it's
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
already deducted $6.6 million so
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
whichever it is and you can use that
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
number in straight to away take into the
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
account for the calculation for the swep
 
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
warrant um the other thing is also the
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
timing of when we would know that number
 
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.590 align:start position:0%
timing of when we would know that number
um

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
so I spoken to the uh to Bruce um our
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal uh you know the the person who
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
manages the uh the the uh the the tax
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
rate calculation for the uh Statewide
 
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
education property tax and um he
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
indicated that the probably the best
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
timing to let for us to know that number
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
would be in early September um so that
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
we can calculate start calculating the
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
warrant is is that a better issue that
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
we allow Ways and Means to make than the
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
policy committee dealing with education
 
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.829 align:start position:0%
policy committee dealing with education
policy

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I guess in terms of the um the the
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
timing and and the date range of of the
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
revenues um I I I I I would assume the
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
ways it means or or maybe um the the
 
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor might have have an indication of
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
of when well he indicated he thought the
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
bill was going to go to ways and means
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
but here we have it right here where
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
we're talking about adequacy and
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
everything else yeah and I'm not certain
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
how the bills get um sort it out between
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
um um so I I I I can't answer that
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry okay thank you are
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
there other questions from the committee
 
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
here for Revenue Administration yes
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
represent luno so thank you very much Mr
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair and thank you very much for
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
joining us again um could you talk a
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
little bit about um the uh the larger
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
picture in terms of how how monies flow
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh from the various Revenue sources into
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund obviously the
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
swept is just one of those U components
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
but um Lottery funds um I think are are
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated Lottery funds in excess of of
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
administrative cost prizes things like
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
that and then and then revenues that
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
come from uh business taxes and others I
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could sort of talk
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
about how all of that is done um in
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
general in general each each kind of a
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
revenue Source um within that particular
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
statute would have a distribution um
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
section in the statute that says okay
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
this particular Revenue um is there a
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of this Revenue that goes to
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and then the
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
remainder will go to general fund um so
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
there is no I don't think there's one
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
standard um law that applies to all
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
revenues so you need you'll need to look
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
at each particular reeven Revenue source
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
to see how that's being allocated uh by
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
legislature uh when when they drafted
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the bill to say okay we want a
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
certain percentage to go to to the
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund like U like for
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax for example the um
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle rental revenue is 100%
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
Going to the education trust fund so
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
that is in within the musing rooms um
 
00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:28.839 align:start position:0%
statute itself yeah so each each statute
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
will be different
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yes yes and so for for uh revenues
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
that let's say come from uh business
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
profits tax business Enterprise tax yes
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
those percentages are a little more
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
Dynamic maybe based on budget um years
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
and Ways and Means maybe or um it it was
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
but last year um there was a bill I
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
believe it was last session um where it
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
fix and now it slipped my mind I can't
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
can't remember the percentage rate but
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
they legislature had fixed the uh the
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
percentage that goes to the education
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
trust fund and the the remained going to
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
the ETF so it's now a fixed percentage
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
whereas in the past before that bill it
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
was very tied to the tax rate itself so
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a calculation that
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
ties to the tax rate and then from that
 
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage goes to the
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is C percentage
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
goes to the um to the general fund and
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
when the tax X rate changes the amount
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
goes to each of the funds changes so um
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
based on that so and and if you can look
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
back to the history of the U let's say
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
business profits tax rates um whenever
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislation would meet
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
and potentially each session there might
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
be a change in the in the tax rate to
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax so now um after
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
the last session uh legislature has
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
decided to okay let's fix the rate can't
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
remember the rate now might be 40% I
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
can't don't callot me oh just me right
 
00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:06.509 align:start position:0%
can't don't callot me oh just me right
now

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:06.519 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
yeah for the committee we were provided
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
a sheet regarding the education trust
 
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
fund and all those revenues that was
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
passed out I think several meetings back
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
it's a sheet that shows all these
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
revenues you can go from the business
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
profits tax business Enterprise tax
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
meals and room tobacco real estate Etc
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
write down the list there and see the
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues they coming in far as
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
out the
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
fy2 so that is available to
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
us so are there any other questions for
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration right
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
now yes represent cordelli thank you
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um so basically
 
00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839 align:start position:0%
what I understood you to be saying is
 
00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:52.150 align:start position:0%
what I understood you to be saying is
that

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
Dr would prefer to see an amount uh
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
certified to you by the treasury for the
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
excess over the 6.6 million and that
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
would um uh preferably happen in early
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
September for your calculations yes um
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
that would make it more straightforward
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
so that uh there's no question in uh as
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
to where we would get that uh where in
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
the accounts like is it the act or is it
 
00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
the cash flow um we will get the the the
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
amount um and and which date range so if
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
we were to be informed okay this is the
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
number that we to we to use so that
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
would help make it more straightfor but
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
if if there's other methods you know as
 
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
long as there's a fixed and um and
 
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.069 align:start position:0%
long as there's a fixed and um and
known

00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
known
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
um uh I guess um qualification for that
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
number we can do that too as long as
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
that's very clear to us okay yep thank
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
you yep and if we have this information
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
by September as you've
 
00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
stated is that timing enough for for
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
districts to know or know what their
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
rates are going to be taxing so that
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
number we inform at least at least by
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
September one yeah um and then that will
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
go into the and then be receiving all
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
the information from from the
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then we would be
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
calculating the tax rate and that would
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
generate the warrant to go out to the
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities so all this will happen
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
before the issuance of the warrant yeah
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing thank you very much
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so committee we have this
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
um I think where we are is that there's
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues to have to be resolved
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
but it's best resolved in Ways and
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
Means unless you're going to look at
 
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.390 align:start position:0%
Means unless you're going to look at
intent

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
yes again I want to apologize because I
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
expected this was going to Ways and
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
Means and that we'd be working on an
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I like I said I'm not a tax
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
expert so I guess my goal would be to
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
get it two ways and means so I could sit
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
down with people over there and make an
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill it's obviously
 
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
going to need some changes to fix it up
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
and uh that that was my goal I didn't I
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was going to come here
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
so um if that could be possible I I'll
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
certainly say that I'll be working with
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
the people in ways and means to come up
 
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that addresses the
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
concerns that not only raised here but
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
raised by uh the department as well just
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
to let you know okay thank you thank you
 
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.230 align:start position:0%
to let you know okay thank you thank you
very

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
much uh any other discussion right here
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
Boni thank you Mr chair um my question
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
actually is too intent um so right now
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
100% of Lottery funds raised less costs
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
go into the education trust fund and if
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
that's the case uh aren't we we're
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
really reducing Revenue into the
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund that's going to
 
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
sources I don't have an answer to
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's why I think it needs to
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
be you know I don't have all those
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
figures in front of me right now so I
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
can't respond to that but and there our
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
committees that have that information
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
and are constantly thinking dollars and
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
cents whereas we are not we're talking
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
overall policy you know why we need the
 
00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:35.029 align:start position:0%
overall policy you know why we need the
sweat

00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
sweat
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
so yes represent
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
leus it looks to me in reading this and
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
that they're making sure that we're
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
not reducing the amount that we've been
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
getting because what we got in 23 three
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
was the 6,600 th000 and so they're say
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
so it looks like what they're saying
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
is what comes in over that is what's
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to be used to help reduce the the
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
property tax the swept property
 
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
tax and that's why that 6.6 million is
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
because that's what we've been getting
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
and so they're taking it's a way of
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
defining the excess because if you say
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
excess you have to Define it so they're
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
defining it as whatever is above what we
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
got in
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
23 representative
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair good morning
 
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
everybody I'm troubled with doing
 
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
anything that uh addresses swept when
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
the court in November said swep was
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so it doesn't make any
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
sense to me at all to deal with this in
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
this way and maybe the
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
sponsors remark that perhaps it should
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
be if one wants to address the revenue
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
from games of
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
chance in the way that he's saying but
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
he spoke about maybe it would go towards
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
paying down the retirement debt that
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
makes sense to
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
me f discussion represent cardelli yeah
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
it's not my understanding that the court
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
said that uh swept was unconstitutional
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
reaching further than the court
 
00:21:32.919 --> 00:21:36.110 align:start position:0%
reaching further than the court
specified

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps thanks very much Mr chair um
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
actually I think the court did say that
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
the way that um that swept was currently
 
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
being um um uh administered is
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and they called it an
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional tax so so I think
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's characterization
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
was spot on that but but the point I
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
really wanted to make I think is um
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
is when we're you know when we take a
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
look at at House Bill
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
1516 and it seeks to um uh
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
reduce uh revenue flowing into the
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund through the
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide um through through swept uh
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh then um then you know you know you
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
take a look at that trust fund it's um
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's got to gener a certain
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
amount of cash to uh to fund public
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
schools to fund efas to fund building
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
Aid to fund uh special education Aid to
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
fund there may be some other items as
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
well but when we're when we're taking um
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
when we're
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
reducing uh re a supply revenue from One
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
Source in case of the swep it actually
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
puts greater Demand on um Revenue from
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
other sources such as business profits
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
tax business Enterprise tax rooms and
 
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
meals tax and and others and uh the um
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
the report that I think the chair held
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
up is uh is right out of the um the the
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
most recent cfer the comprehensive
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
annual financial report uh which is
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
something that um that that all of us
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
should uh should be getting because it
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
it it it does show where uh where the
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
money's come from but uh yeah we reduce
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
it in leftt it's got to be made up for
 
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.830 align:start position:0%
it in leftt it's got to be made up for
somewhere

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
else represent
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
leus can we just reassign this to Ways
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
and Means because the things that people
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
are saying and are concerned about does
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
not is not what the bill is actually
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
saying so I think there are enough of us
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
that don't understand how this bill
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
Works can we just have it reassigned you
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
know just whatever that term is they use
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
but send it to Ways and Means
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
reassign it to ways and means it's
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
pretty late to be vacating an early bill
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
um the early bill has to be out here
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
this week so there's another way of
 
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
getting it the way means put it on
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
consent and send the ways means it comes
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
back to the the floor for a vote uh how
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
you'd have to be very careful in how you
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
wrote your committee report up with the
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
intent of why we'd like to see it go
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
there uh there's a bigger picture to
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
this whole thing right now with the
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
education trust and that's something
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
that this policy committee ought to be
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
aware of I'm not looking at that Revenue
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
sheet right now but if you look at the
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
figure in the bottom right hand column
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
on the very
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
bottom total revenues there are what 222
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
million dollar as I
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
recall in in the
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
fund now that money which is not used
 
00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:54.919 align:start position:0%
would then there's an effort to put it
 
00:24:58.269 --> 00:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
back into the general fund and use that
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
money to support other aspects of
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
running this
 
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.990 align:start position:0%
running this
state

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
now there one can read pluses to that or
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
in one can read minuses but I think each
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
one of you need to be considering where
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
we're going in terms of some of the
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
issues that are affecting education
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out how to
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
support catastrophic Aid We're trying to
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
support figure out how to support
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
building Aid we're trying to figure out
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
how to support adequacy all these things
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
are going on right now uh we we just
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
passed a bill not too long ago on a 12
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
to8 vat which dealt with uh providing
 
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
meal plans for breakfast or lunch which
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
is a costway program I think that zeroed
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
in somewhere between $4 and $50 million
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
where's that money going to come from
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
right so there there are a lot of policy
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
considerations that have to be looked at
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of of the bigger picture uh
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
where are we going with the education
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
and and this one right here I don't
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
think this committee is
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
really qualified right now to make some
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
of these decisions regarding we're
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
qualified yes but uh from a policy
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
perspective but our job is also to try
 
00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:14.919 align:start position:0%
and figure out where the revenues are
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
coming from and how that it meshes out
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
with everything else that we're using
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
revenues for to run the state and that
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
is the job of ways and means um so uh I
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
kind of agree with represent that
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
because I like to get this thing over
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
the way of means somehow and and U try
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
to write in some kind of a committee
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
report that you know we don't really
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
take a position on this we just want to
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
get this thing out and get a better idea
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
of the impacts to it graan
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
luno thanks very much Mr chair you know
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
the I I I don't know why we feel like or
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
why why there may be such a why we're in
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
a rush to get this over to ways and
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
means I don't know why the games of
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
chance under 287 D20 are necessarily any
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
different than any other than any other
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources that may go up or down
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
in any in any given year uh certainly
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor could file this bill
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
again and uh and then maybe it would be
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
rooted routed um more directly over to
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
ways and means but I certainly don't
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
don't see that that we should
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily consider this particular
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
um which is
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
in the grand scheme of of Lottery uh as
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
being something that that then offsets
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh another Revenue Source frankly I
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
don't know how the watery commission be
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
able to consider to be able to say every
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
dollar goes to uh goes to schools if
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
it's all of a sudden taking away a
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
dollar from from somewhere else so so I
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
I really don't see any reason to uh to
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
FastTrack this to uh to ways of me means
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
um um it doesn't appear that that the um
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
that the that the amount is going to be
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
terribly large uh but uh but that the
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
impact I think on on other Revenue
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
sources down the road uh would uh would
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
not be good and um and you know I I I
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
think we could just take care of it
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
right here represent cordelli did you
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just say that I I think
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
that the goal is to apply
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
the excess over 6.6 million and let um
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
let the treasury work that out um as
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
suggested by Dr um that that be applied
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
to swep to reduce local property taxes
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
local local school taxes um that would
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
come straight off the the state line on
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
our tax statement um for any amount uh
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
in in excess that was applied um I think
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's a a worthy goal and something
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
that um we should look at and um get
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
over to Dr and I would be all in favor
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
of I'm sorry yes Ways and Means um
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
getting ahead of myself um uh check with
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
the um maybe the speaker's office and
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
see if um we could vacate it to stay
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
within the time frames of reporting by
 
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.590 align:start position:0%
within the time frames of reporting by
the

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
15th that we can check yes we can check
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
that out represent Miler U thank you Mr
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
chairman you know I I may be uh way out
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
in left field here I don't know but uh I
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
recall when Governor Hassen was the
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
governor and she was pushing gaming big
 
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:41.559 align:start position:0%
time I was against it then and I'm
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
against it now and uh I just I just I
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned you know as I see these
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
ads on TV I I when I saw these ads on TV
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
about gambling here and gambling there
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
I'm saying where the hell this come from
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
oh this is Charity game gaming right
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
charity gaming right 35% supposed to go
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
to local charities there's a heck of a
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
lot of money going to those who own this
 
00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:08.710 align:start position:0%
lot of money going to those who own this
gaming

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
establishment and uh I I frankly I'm I'm
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to gambling I'm opposed to this
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
bill and I may be way out there but I'm
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
going to stick by my guns I was against
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
it when Governor hasson did it I'm
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
against it now I don't like to see the
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
ads on TV and I think this is is a an
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
kind of an IFC come uh source of
 
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh and I I'm just opposed to the
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
concept alog together and we've never
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
had a gaming bill that we've decided in
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
this committee it's gone elsewhere to
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
other committees thank you so that
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's we have we have not acted on any
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
that's been ever since I've been in the
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
house we've had gaming bills coming up
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
and and uh the house has never been
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
supportive of that whereas the Senate
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
May is maybe uh so it's repesent
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
leus is Ways and Means the second
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
committee that this would go to I I
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that's a decision that's made
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
by because I was just thinking if that
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
was the second committee then all we're
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
doing by vacating it is moving it to
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
them a week early because they would be
 
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
getting it and be under the second
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
committee time but maybe not but that's
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
what I was
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
thinking to do that
 
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't stop this bill doesn't
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
stop charitable gaming the money's
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
coming in now the excess money would
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
still be going
 
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:40.519 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund because
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change that
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
law all this says is if there is extra
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
it goes to help offset property tax yeah
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
so where we are right now is we're going
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
to have the debate on this tomorrow it's
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
up for executing tomorrow it's an early
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
early bill that's why we do have a rush
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
on the bill um and we you know had the
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
really the bill presented to us uh by
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
the representative that brought forward
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
today and that's the first time I've
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
really even dealt with this thing and of
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
course on top of the all the 23 early
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
bills we've had and the 49 other bills
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
that have fiscal notes attached to them
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's been a very burdens and type
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
uh last several months so um if we have
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
nothing else say on this right now I
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
will go forward and see if it can be
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
vacated but I doubt that that's going to
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
be the case seeing that we have
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
possession of it and there's only you
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
know it's got to be acted on by the
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
house floor or submitted for Action by
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
the 15th and so we're in that week so Mr
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
chair yes um another and I think it's
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
good to check on on whether whether this
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
could be vacated uh but um but you know
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
just a just another comment on this as a
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
policy as we the the way the funding
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
formula works and correct me if I'm
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
wrong is that is that is that the state
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant the direct state adequacy
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
grants um get paid um directly
 
00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:19.190 align:start position:0%
grants um get paid um directly
to

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh after the swept has
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
been collected so that when less swept
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
is collected there will be for whatever
 
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
that that difference is less that will
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
be additional
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
State funds that come from the education
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
trust fund to make up for that
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
difference so if we short the swept by
 
00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:44.919 align:start position:0%
say I mean just which we've done before
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
but by $100 million right right if by so
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
just like what we what what happened
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
three years ago if you short the swept
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
by $100 million it means two things it
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
means $100 million needs to come in to
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund to make it for
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
that different difference and another
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
100 million has to come in because
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
you've got increased direct adequacy
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
grants that need to be made for those
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
communities that are now paying that are
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
now um uh raising Less in sweat towards
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
their adequacy amount it it's a double
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
it's a double Guta represent cordelli
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and three years ago when we
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
did the reduction um of $100 million in
 
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.909 align:start position:0%
did the reduction um of $100 million in
Swat

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
Swat
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
um we did take money uh from um Surplus
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
I believe to um compensate for that so
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
that there was no shortfall in the
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
education trust fund by $100 million um
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
so that that difference was made up and
 
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
I think we're talking about um an amount
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
in excess of the 6.6 which um you know I
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
I think again Ways and Means would have
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
a better handle on if that's the right
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
number or
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
not6 we don't know what that is but uh
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
if that is what we have been getting
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund from uh
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
the lottery uh from all sorts of gaming
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
um then uh I don't see a problem because
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
anything in the future um with possibly
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
more uh gaming and and I understand the
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to gaming um but it would
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
just be additional revenues we see in
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
the future uh over and above what we're
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
getting now that would go to reduce the
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
swept in the property
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
tax okay so we're gonna close this work
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
session down right now because we've
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
gone beyond our time but we will pick
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
this up tomorrow during the exact
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
session so we take about a four or five
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
minute break right now and then we're
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
gonna CAU us pardon me were we going to
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
CAU us now or did you want to talk yeah
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
well that's what we're going to take the
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
break and then we're going to go talk
 
00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
y um basically you don't have to put it
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
out yet because we want to go talk of
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
them then come back and then we'll put
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:58:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
party caucus for a few moments here and
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
we will probably be back in about 20 20
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
minutes so approximately by that clock
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
around quarter after
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
thereabouts the hour excuse me I'm
 
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
looking now it's a shadow on it um so
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be coming back here probably
 
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.910 align:start position:0%
we'll be coming back here probably
around

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
earlier I don't think they know they're
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
not supposed to so so during caucus all
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
people are not on the committee need to
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
room you
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.839 --> 00:59:19.710 align:start position:0%
 
12:45

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
12:45
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
B I got find my
 
00:59:22.039 --> 00:59:23.630 align:start position:0%
B I got find my
amendments

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:59:23.640 --> 01:23:56.430 align:start position:0%
amendments
yeah

01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
I want to remind committee members that
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
if you make a motion that the motion uh
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
you have to write the committee report
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to have those committee
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
reports done as quickly as possible
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
today so with that let's get into the
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
business of the first bill which we're
 
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
going to take up and we will we'll go
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
down in a sequential order but we're
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to jump over a few
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
bills uh and then come back I okay the
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%

brought forward again this year after
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
issues were found last year with the
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
organization that was to be listed on
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
the back of the um student ID cards and
 
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
this is related to
 
01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
um eating disorders and awareness
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
building awareness in high school
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
students of eating disorders and this
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
year the it was when it was brought
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
forward the number is for the National
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
Alliance for eating disorders and we
 
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
have been assured that this organization
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
is well vetted and has been around for
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
long enough that we can be assured that
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
they won't have issues with their card
 
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
and they plan on extending the hours
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
that they are available to take live
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
calls but as we were working on the bill
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
and looking up um looking up the laws we
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
noticed that the um Suicide Hotline That
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be on the back of ID
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
cards also needed to be update and so we
 
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
brought forth this amendment to update
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
the um title of the suicide the 988
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
suicide in crisis lifeline and so that's
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it puts two
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
numbers on the back of the ID cards
 
01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Amon do you have any
 
01:28:01.639 --> 01:28:03.470 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Amon do you have any
further

01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
discussion Echo all of what
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
representative peternell said and just
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
clear the amendment adds to the original
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
Bill language so the bill language
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
regarding the National Alliance foring
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
service hel line is exactly the same and
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
then just adds this section to update
 
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
the correct title of what was the
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
National Suicide Prevention and is now
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
the 988 suicide and crisis Lifeline so
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
students will have access to both
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
numbers and can use what is relevant to
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
their particular needs thank you is
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion from the
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
leus I just want to commend rep Damon
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
and rep Pell for what I understand was a
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
complicated process to do
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
what looks like a simple thing I guess
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
it was very complicated so thank you
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
very much represent Cordell thank you Mr
 
01:29:02.669 --> 01:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
chair um I guess I want to second that
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
what representative Lua said because as
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
you all both are all know I was very
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
much against the original bill due to
 
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
the lack of 247 coverage and some other
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
issues uh you all know that but I feel
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
like this is a great example of um doing
 
01:29:19.149 --> 01:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
what's best for the kids and getting
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
this uh the the language changed here
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
and an updated Suicide Hotline I don't
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
think it's perfect I'm still concerned
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
about this organization they say they're
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
going to go 24 you know increase their
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
hours I hope they abide by that um but I
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
will be voting for this amendment and
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you further discussion
 
01:29:40.109 --> 01:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
represented Ry thank you very much this
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
is not a hill I want to die on um but um
 
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
I just want to reiterate that the the
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
still the trend is to go to 988 it's to
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
go to three-digit numbers to make it
 
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
easy here's the emergency numbers in
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County that could all go easily
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
on the back of an ID because they're all
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
important um and we're moving towards
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
the easiest way to get there you get a
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
real person
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
247 on the 988 hotline at this point and
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I feel is important I
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
understand where you are all coming from
 
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:13.960 align:start position:0%

speak to your motion yes to um the bill
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
that was presented initially had some
 
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
language added uh in line 789 pertaining
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
to how the members were selected would
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
strike all of that in the amendment
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
there's no need for it keep the original
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
um law and the only change would be uh
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
in the requirement in line 16 uh
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
attending all school board meetings just
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
taking the word all so that it said it
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
reads as original attending school board
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
meetings and then strike the Bold that
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
came in after that so it just removes
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
all and districts can decide which
 
01:35:59.950 --> 01:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
school board meetings they need to
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
attend they can attend them all or they
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%

right okay so good job uh going down to
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
the next bill which we have on the
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
docket that we're jumping a couple here
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
is HB
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
1356 this is relative to the use of
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
children's names and pronouns by Public
 
01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
School Employees a look to
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh leus to for a
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
motion I move to itl hb13 1856 is there
 
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.629 align:start position:0%
motion I move to itl hb13 1856 is there
a

01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
second who who made that
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
one did represent Damon make that motion
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
I think she okay represent Damon makes
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
so okay motion made by itl by represent
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
leus and second by representative Damon
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
our representative leus would you like
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yes um I think
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
was not written right and the biggest
 
01:39:24.189 --> 01:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
thing that jumped out at me before I
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
even got very far down reading it was
 
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
well partly just given names and knowing
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
that some kids never liked their given
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
names and never went by them in school
 
01:39:37.589 --> 01:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
and the other part is just nicknames in
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
general whether it's sports teams or
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
whatever nicknames are an important part
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
of acceptance to a kid you get a
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
nickname it means you know you're known
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're recognized whatever and so
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
the idea that we can't give kids
 
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
nicknames without parental permission is
 
01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.790 align:start position:0%
nicknames without parental permission is
just

01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
wrong represent represent
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
Amon what she

01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
um as a prior teacher myself as a prior
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
principal later uh administrator outside
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
the state um the it's the responsibility
 
01:41:14.589 --> 01:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
and I'll take kindergarten for example
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
and I've said this before in committee
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
everything a kid should know is learned
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
and taught in kindergarten
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
and that means having to work together
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
collaborate together respect the other
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
person that's coming in and out of the
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
door uh and that's all social
 
01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
interaction and so I I believe that
 
01:41:37.629 --> 01:41:37.639 align:start position:0%
there's this this bill is uh uh there
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
got a lot of stuff in it and when it's
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
in indicating to a teacher you got to be
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
very careful in terms of uh in teaching
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
these social skills which are
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
extremely important to listen when the
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
teacher is talking you don't sit there
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
you know gabbing with a friend uh that's
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
a social skill and it's also a necessary
 
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
skill in in order to learn so this is
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
why I'm opposing uh and the the passage
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill it's it's a skill that's
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
necessary the social experiences in
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
athletics and is extremely important
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to it thank you very
 
01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
much representer yes thank you uh
 
01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
chairman cordelli uh I think in the in
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
the um 12 years I've been on this
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
committee that this hearing um was
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
probably the they had the broadest
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
breath of individuals that came before
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
us I mean we had Corrections people we
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
had social workers we had counselors we
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
had teachers we had parents and I think
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
this was a very telling uh hearing that
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
really talked about the breath of the
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
need for to deal with kids social
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
emotional learning and also I think the
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
issue too that when we talk about
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
businesses one of the things that the
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
business people say that we need to have
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
people who can communicate with one
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
another who can deal with one another so
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
I I I totally agree with the itl on this
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%

01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
it we're slowing down a little bit here
 
01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
we're getting ahead of our clerk no it's
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
1496 okay we have a motion on the table
 
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
it's to itl 1496 the motion's made by
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
represent Miler and second by
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
representative lad representative Miler
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
you're recognized yes I think I think
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
this is uh again is a there's no
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
question in our minds that that students
 
01:44:59.229 --> 01:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
need to be protected and I believe that
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
currently that uh schools have done uh a
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
great job in uh making that available
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
particularly in the environment that we
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
have across the country and within this
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
state to make sure that students do have
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
the benefit of going to school and
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
parents have the benefit of that they're
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
going to be safe so I don't think this
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
is necessary thank you
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
and as making the of the seven the
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
second here uh on line five the bill
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's mentioned to local parentice in
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
this bill and I think it's extremely
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
important that um we don't have it
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in statute and school
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
districts years and years ago had this
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
terminology in and we got into real
 
01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
problem areas with it I think it's best
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
that local Apprentice not be put into
 
01:45:46.719 --> 01:45:49.470 align:start position:0%
that local Apprentice not be put into
statutory

01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
language further discussion on the bill
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative beler thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add to what um you
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
commented on that I I think I understand
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
the underlining intent of the bill and I
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a good intent but the
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
possibility has been raised that by
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
adding in local parenes to the bill
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're not sure if we're actually
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
expanding the scope of requirement and
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
possible uh interventions on the part of
 
01:46:15.629 --> 01:46:15.639 align:start position:0%
the school so I think the safest thing
 
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
to do is itl and uh maybe we'll see this
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
again with different language in the
 
01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.109 align:start position:0%
again with different language in the
future

01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:28.760 align:start position:0%

second second by representative Miler
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
um anything uh to comment uh I'm trying
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
okay this bill is addressing to the
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
requirement of a of an
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
assessment for
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
graduation and
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
um the in the high school the Statewide
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
assessment would be the SAT and that's
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
given in the 11th grade I don't think
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's a proper assessment of the
 
01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
curriculum maybe that's provided in that
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
particular School even though it's one
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
we use uh in the 11th grade so um I I
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
think there's multiple ways of De
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
determining uh a student being competent
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
in these areas and I don't think it's
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily done through a singular
 
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
test represent Miler I
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
did thank you um anything further from
 
01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.109 align:start position:0%
did thank you um anything further from
the

01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:46.069 --> 01:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
committee uh seen yes representative
 
01:50:49.709 --> 01:50:49.719 align:start position:0%
Lakers I see I just wanted to say that I
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
think think this could be done through
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
like the GED or the highet or something
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
but there is nothing in here specifying
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
what it is well there is but what as
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative L as chairman lad
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
said it's the SAT and I think that is
 
01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:11.800 align:start position:0%
not at all the appropriate test thank
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%

02:04:00.549 --> 02:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
Belcher yes thank you Mr chair so what
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to do is it it expands
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
the Board of Education in the state from
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
Seven members to 11 um and it designates
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh that the new positions will be filled
 
02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:15.719 align:start position:0%
primarily by those who are um
 
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the field of Education
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
or Administration now we've heard
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um that from the Board of
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
Education that this really this this
 
02:04:28.229 --> 02:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
bill would flip the historical intent of
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
the board of education on its head where
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
the board was originally founded to be a
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
a facet of our government of by and for
 
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
the people run by a civilian um
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
nonprofessional oversight um by putting
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
these positions in there it would really
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
move it toward a more administrative
 
02:04:49.629 --> 02:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
model it would put put people in the
 
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
position of regulating their own fields
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
that they're um actively employed in
 
02:04:56.350 --> 02:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
which is generally not considered the
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
best practice from fields to
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals to finance and Beyond um
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
as it creates incentives uh that could
 
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
be not great um in terms of
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
self-regulation like that um so it would
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
create a moral hazard in that effect
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much from the
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%

02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
various boards and certifications and
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
whatever to try to do away with any
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
places where you have the people
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
regulating themselves because they have
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
found problems with that through the
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
years and they have been going through
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
to make them independent or advisory
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
only Etc and so this sort of goes
 
02:05:57.870 --> 02:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
backwards from what we're trying to do
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
in all in across the state in all the
 
02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:02.709 align:start position:0%
in all in across the state in all the
other

02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
areas thank you represent
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
Tanner um thank you uh this is my bill
 
02:06:10.589 --> 02:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
and I do have an amendment that changes
 
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
it um which I would offer if it if we
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
get a chance but um whenever you have a
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
board like this that is making decisions
 
02:06:21.149 --> 02:06:21.159 align:start position:0%
like they're going to actually make a
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
decision on the 306 standards they um
 
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
have become the the the board that uh
 
02:06:33.629 --> 02:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
makes a ton of decisions uh affecting
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
education in the state and yet no one on
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
the on the board has any education
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
background or at least is not um versed
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
in that and I find that very difficult
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure on the the um AMA they have
 
02:06:51.069 --> 02:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
a few doctors uh retired doctors or
 
02:06:53.229 --> 02:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
people that have been in in the medical
 
02:06:56.549 --> 02:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
field um you know just because you're uh
 
02:06:59.069 --> 02:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
Ride On A Plane uh you don't become a
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
pilot and um you know I think people
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh use the idea that they've
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
gone to school for the 12 years um of
 
02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
schooling and then post-graduate or post
 
02:07:15.149 --> 02:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
yeah postsecondary education
 
02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
post-graduate education um that they
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
know what is happening in classrooms and
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
teachers uh and our public education
 
02:07:25.950 --> 02:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
across the state and I think in the
 
02:07:27.629 --> 02:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
recent years the reason I brought this
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
forward is I've been
 
02:07:32.430 --> 02:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
seeing uh a lot of misunderstandings
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
coming from that state board level and I
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
I think that it needs to be expanded
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
certainly we have a lot more on their
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
plate than they did in uh 1919 when it
 
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
was formed uh you know we we've expanded
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh um our population our population of
 
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh children to educate and um I just
 
02:07:58.030 --> 02:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
feel that it it's necessary to have this
 
02:08:01.709 --> 02:08:01.719 align:start position:0%
discussion um about the state board and
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's a shame uh really to have
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
to look at boards and try to filter out
 
02:08:09.149 --> 02:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
anybody that might have any expertise in
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
that field thank you represent McDonald
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm not going to
 
02:08:18.030 --> 02:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
speak to the qualifications of the board
 
02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:18.950 align:start position:0%
speak to the qualifications of the board
memb

02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
memb
 
02:08:20.910 --> 02:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
as listed in statute or in the bill or
 
02:08:23.549 --> 02:08:23.559 align:start position:0%
amended I'm more concerned about the
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
fact that we are expanding the number of
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
members on the board and it seems to me
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
to be an expansion of government that is
 
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
unwarranted have we heard testimony that
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
more members should be on this board and
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
what purpose that serves to me it's
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
deeply concerning with those questions
 
02:08:41.950 --> 02:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
unanswered so I will not be supporting
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you represent Cornell I I
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
think I was most concerned about the
 
02:08:51.149 --> 02:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
lack of an application process when the
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
chair of the board was asked how do
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
people get put on the board or what is
 
02:08:57.790 --> 02:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
the application process he I think he
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
said I don't know I got a call out of
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
the blue asking me if I wanted to be on
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
it so I said yes and to me that's a
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
little bit concerning that there isn't
 
02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
any method of choosing the people that
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
are on it if you can get a call out of
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
the blue and say do you want to be on
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
this board and you say oh yeah sure that
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
that's concerning to
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
me representative
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
wood thank you chairman L um I just want
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
to follow up a moment if I may on uh
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner's comments the
 
02:09:33.069 --> 02:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
same ilk here when I look around this
 
02:09:35.790 --> 02:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
particular board that we're sitting in
 
02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:40.119 align:start position:0%
right here now and we try to establish
 
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
policy and how many times that people on
 
02:09:45.870 --> 02:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
this board said I was a teacher I was an
 
02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
administrator and I bring this to the
 
02:09:50.669 --> 02:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
board and others who are not there who
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
are not teachers early balance it out so
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
we have a wider perspective what we're
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
saying here is we don't want that wider
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
perspective I I think we need to have uh
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and the folks around this table who
 
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
have backgrounds and education who have
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
taught always bring a different
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
perspective than those that haven't and
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
that's how we get a balance of good
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
policy I think this the board definitely
 
02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:14.599 align:start position:0%
needs to have some professional balance
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
on here I would I would follow uh as
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tana has said that it's
 
02:10:20.750 --> 02:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
probably imperative of this board
 
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
particularly with the rural State
 
02:10:24.189 --> 02:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
education thank you chairman lad further
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Damon and then
 
02:10:26.719 --> 02:10:27.669 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Damon and then
represent

02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chair I'm opposed to
 
02:10:33.629 --> 02:10:33.639 align:start position:0%
the itl I think in
 
02:10:37.149 --> 02:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
any area of knowledge there are people
 
02:10:39.629 --> 02:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
who are educated and have
 
02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
expertise that we should want to have
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
participate in decision making I
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want the Department of
 
02:10:50.910 --> 02:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental services to pass
 
02:10:53.310 --> 02:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
regulations for septic design without
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
folks who have expertise in septic
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
systems to provide input to that I would
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
not want a pharmacy board or the FDA
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
process for approving meds not to
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
involve the folks who know the most
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
about pharmaceutical studies I think
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's a frankly absurd idea that we
 
02:11:20.109 --> 02:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't involve educated trained
 
02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:23.719 align:start position:0%
education professionals on the board of
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
education represent dry thank you for uh
 
02:11:31.950 --> 02:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I the governor and Council
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
appoint the members of the board that
 
02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
means there is some vetting going on it
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
has to go through the governor and
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
council meeting and uh just like a judge
 
02:11:42.669 --> 02:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
or any other appointment so I'm thinking
 
02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
there is more than just answering a
 
02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.430 align:start position:0%
there is more than just answering a
phone

02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
phone
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
call represent uh cordelli thank you Mr
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
chairman um just in terms of uh the uh
 
02:11:58.270 --> 02:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
selection of members um having been a
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
member of heak home education advisory
 
02:12:03.870 --> 02:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
Council and the uh special education
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
advisory Council um I have recommended
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
people for both of those um
 
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
organizations um myself um uh some go
 
02:12:20.589 --> 02:12:20.599 align:start position:0%
through through to the governor's office
 
02:12:20.599 --> 02:12:21.350 align:start position:0%
through through to the governor's office
my

02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:12:24.430 --> 02:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations um he act um just goes
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
through if there's an opening to the
 
02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
speaker's office um but I remember also
 
02:12:31.790 --> 02:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
there was a period in time with uh uh
 
02:12:35.149 --> 02:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
the special education advisory Council
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
when leadership of that Council was
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
requiring prospective members to come in
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
and be interviewed by the council which
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
I strongly objected to um you know
 
02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:48.549 align:start position:0%
I strongly objected to um you know
filtering

02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:48.559 align:start position:0%
filtering
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
applicants by the the council themselves
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
so I I think that the uh current process
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh works well and as representative dry
 
02:12:58.549 --> 02:12:58.559 align:start position:0%
said it all goes through the governor
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
and the executive counsel that's why we
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
have an executive Council thank
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:11.950 --> 02:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
chair okay I'm going to put the elephant
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
here Mr it wise has come
 
02:13:19.950 --> 02:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
forward in the
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
past the board of educ state board of
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
education has had a very balanced
 
02:13:27.549 --> 02:13:27.559 align:start position:0%
approach to looking at
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
issues you've had people who've been
 
02:13:32.229 --> 02:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
conservative you had people who've been
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
liberal unfortunately at this point in
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
time because of the current leadership
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
state we have an ultraconservative State
 
02:13:43.549 --> 02:13:43.559 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
Education with no
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
balance that's my concern no
 
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
balance and I think the this has been I
 
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
don't know the motive behind
 
02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:55.709 align:start position:0%
don't know the motive behind
representative

02:13:55.709 --> 02:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:58.549 --> 02:13:58.559 align:start position:0%
Tanner's uh Amendment
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
here but I think it represents a
 
02:14:04.750 --> 02:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
need for the Department of Education the
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education to have a more
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
balanced look at what's happening in
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
education and the decision-making
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
process that needs to take place and I'm
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
not talking about having a liberal board
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
or or a total conservative board I'm
 
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
talking about a
 
02:14:25.229 --> 02:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
balance and in the past there has been a
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
balance on that
 
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
board there is no balance on the board
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
as it sits right now based upon the
 
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
decision making that they
 
02:14:38.589 --> 02:14:38.599 align:start position:0%
have we have the 306s that are coming up
 
02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
major issue that's going to direct
 
02:14:43.549 --> 02:14:43.559 align:start position:0%
public education in this
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
state and I have a great deal of fear of
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
what's going to come out of that state
 
02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
board based upon the particular
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
persuasion political persuasion they
 
02:14:56.589 --> 02:14:56.599 align:start position:0%
have right now now we do have thanks to
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
Chairman lad thank you we've had we
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
passed uh 1673 early in this session
 
02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
that talks about an oversight of those
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
rules so that that kind of neutrals my
 
02:15:14.109 --> 02:15:14.119 align:start position:0%
sense a little bit because there'll be
 
02:15:16.270 --> 02:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
some legislative oversight to the
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
decision that's going to take place
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
but I think the motive behind the
 
02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
expanding this we didn't need this
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
before because there was a balanced
 
02:15:30.430 --> 02:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
approach and I think this bill at least
 
02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
provides some sense of people who've had
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
some experience because we have no one
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
in there that really has the experience
 
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
now and I think that's a deficit to the
 
02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
decision-making process that directs
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
public education thank you Mr chair okay
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take an opportunity to speak
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
to this too
 
02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe we need this
 
02:15:56.910 --> 02:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
now and for for numerous
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
reasons we're saying that no one on the
 
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education has the
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
understanding the knowledge the
 
02:16:07.149 --> 02:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
experience and education I don't think
 
02:16:07.159 --> 02:16:07.950 align:start position:0%
experience and education I don't think
that's

02:16:07.950 --> 02:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
so and I don't think it's so that you
 
02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
have to be working in a school to have
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
that experience and that wisdom I also
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
look at the bill as it was introduced
 
02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
us and as it is being submitted
 
02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere where it
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
says there shall not be professionally
 
02:16:30.069 --> 02:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
the person that we have there on the
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
board shall not be engaged in school
 
02:16:35.709 --> 02:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
work Educators or professionally engaged
 
02:16:38.589 --> 02:16:38.599 align:start position:0%
in school work I wonder why that was put
 
02:16:41.549 --> 02:16:41.559 align:start position:0%
into law years ago we don't have the
 
02:16:43.150 --> 02:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent of school sitting on the
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
school board at the local school
 
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
district is there a reason for that of
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
course there's a reason for
 
02:16:53.150 --> 02:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
it and there's a reason why we shouldn't
 
02:16:55.309 --> 02:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
have a superintendent school sitting on
 
02:16:58.270 --> 02:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
too the superintendent of schools is's
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
going to come in with a lot of ownership
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
on topics and engaged in certain
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
organizations which you're going to now
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
be doing the lobbying from the
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
inside I don't think that's right I
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
think this is a citizen legislature we
 
02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
need to have a citizen board
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
running our schools state board and
 
02:17:23.309 --> 02:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's appointed by governor and counsel
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
and our forefathers had the wisdom to
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
check the balance of the governor
 
02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
through a
 
02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
councel and so we have these checks and
 
02:17:36.750 --> 02:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
balances in place the people have to be
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
approved by governor and
 
02:17:43.309 --> 02:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
councel and there the governor and
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
councel are elected by the residents of
 
02:17:48.429 --> 02:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
this state so it's refle reflecting
 
02:17:51.309 --> 02:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
where we are at that moment in time it
 
02:17:54.190 --> 02:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
may not be like it is for as we see it
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
right now 10 years from now it could go
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
the opposite side that's okay one year
 
02:18:01.070 --> 02:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
from now that that's the way democracy
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
works and I I think it's a dreadful err
 
02:18:06.750 --> 02:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
that we people put people on the State
 
02:18:09.389 --> 02:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
Board who are professionally
 
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
engaged in the business of Education
 
02:18:14.349 --> 02:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
where they're making their welfare and
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
their income from that and they're also
 
02:18:18.429 --> 02:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
going to be the ones that are deciding
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
on issues of professionalism on the part
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
of a teacher when that comes up for
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
appeal and action by the state board or
 
02:18:28.709 --> 02:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
other issues uh so uh I'm I I'd be
 
02:18:30.669 --> 02:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
really cautious before moving this this
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
bill forward it seems to me that we're
 
02:18:35.309 --> 02:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
we could be putting people into the
 
02:18:37.629 --> 02:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
State Board who really have conflicts of
 
02:18:40.750 --> 02:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
interest thank you representa cordelli
 
02:18:43.469 --> 02:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
thank you following on to that one of
 
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
the duties of the State Board is to hear
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
a appeals Whenever there is dispute
 
02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
between um a parent and a local school
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
board that's in statute now so if we
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
have um people on there who uh are not
 
02:19:06.509 --> 02:19:06.519 align:start position:0%
citizen um members of the board but
 
02:19:08.910 --> 02:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
professional Educators it might swing
 
02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
the balance in terms of hearing those
 
02:19:14.110 --> 02:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
appeals would there be Rec recusals
 
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
necessary so I think that um that's one
 
02:19:19.870 --> 02:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
area where uh I can see a problem if we
 
02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh move forward with this
 
02:19:24.990 --> 02:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
legislation represent
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
leus our local school boards are elected
 
02:19:31.389 --> 02:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
locally by the
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
citizens this is
 
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
like the state level of that so to
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
individually elect those by the all the
 
02:19:45.549 --> 02:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
people would be unwieldy so instead the
 
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
citizens elect the governor and the
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
executive board and we have had times
 
02:19:54.750 --> 02:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
when those were very divided and the
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
governor voted one way or recommended
 
02:20:02.830 --> 02:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
and the counselors um voted against him
 
02:20:05.309 --> 02:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
depending upon they are representing the
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
makeup of the citizens and the will of
 
02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
the citizens at that time that's what
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
this government is set up for it's a
 
02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:12.910 align:start position:0%
this government is set up for it's a
representative

02:20:12.910 --> 02:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:20:15.309 --> 02:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
democracy and this is furthering that
 
02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
rep representative democracy
 
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
the representatives are the counselors
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
in this case and they're voting the will
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the people who elected them there
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
have been times when it was solidly in
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
one party now it's solidly in another
 
02:20:35.309 --> 02:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
party but that goes back and forth
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
depending upon the will of the people
 
02:20:39.550 --> 02:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
very often it's mixed because very often
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have a mix so it's
 
02:20:45.309 --> 02:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
representing the will of the people
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
which is the point of the school board
 
02:20:50.110 --> 02:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's the appoint of the local school
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
board and this is just the Statewide
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
school board and it needs to be made up
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
and elected the same way in effect as
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
our local school boards and represent
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state representa
 
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um first of all I'd
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
like to say that all the surrounding
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
states uh have Representatives on their
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
on their school boards of even uh
 
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
teachers unions uh aft uh Nea they have
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh superintendents they have teachers um
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
so it's not we're not trying to break uh
 
02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
like the national Trend or anything like
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
that the original school board was also
 
02:21:34.510 --> 02:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
meant uh another F phrase in there that
 
02:21:37.389 --> 02:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
came out was that it was supposed to be
 
02:21:40.030 --> 02:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
uh bipartisan and they had actually a
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
requirement in the initial uh Charter
 
02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
that no more than three people of one
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
party could be on the on on the uh
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
School Board of five so they were they
 
02:21:52.990 --> 02:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
were very um conscious of having it
 
02:21:56.590 --> 02:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
become too political which it has um my
 
02:21:58.750 --> 02:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment takes out the the professional
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
teachers um uh I think it also adds a
 
02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
student uh representative on the board
 
02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
which I think is really really important
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
I think also uh my bill uh speaks to the
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
number of terms and the and the years of
 
02:22:18.670 --> 02:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
terms uh and I think that people that um
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
are appointed uh and we're not sure how
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
they actually get to that position uh
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
could be there for many many many years
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
with the with the four consecutive terms
 
02:22:32.910 --> 02:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
and three-year terms that's a long time
 
02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
to have somebody in so it's not a not a
 
02:22:39.309 --> 02:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
flip that happens on a regular basis um
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have the opportunity to put
 
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
forward the amendment um so um that's my
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
little spe brother discussion on the
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
part of the committee represent Damon Mr
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
chair I have a procedural question um as
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%

02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
OTP the itl has to be voted down and OT
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%

02:23:13.950 --> 02:23:13.960 align:start position:0%

02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
speaks to uh in section three that the
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
governor with the consent of the
 
02:26:08.190 --> 02:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
executive Council shall appoint the
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
members of the board um and the five
 
02:26:13.349 --> 02:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
members shall be selected one each from
 
02:26:15.389 --> 02:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
five executive council districts which
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
is as it is right now so those are
 
02:26:21.309 --> 02:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
people from the community um two members
 
02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
shall be selected from the public at
 
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
large so you have seven members on an 11
 
02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
member board that are community members
 
02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
in addition to that I have one retired
 
02:26:34.590 --> 02:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
public school classroom teacher one
 
02:26:37.030 --> 02:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
parent of a current excuse me is that a
 
02:26:39.469 --> 02:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
retired I says one public school
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
retire pardon me okay I'm looking at the
 
02:26:47.790 --> 02:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
wrong sorry apologize
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
ol one parent of a Current public school
 
02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
student which I think a parent um is
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
really important and then one member of
 
02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school administrators
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
Association and lastly one student who's
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
serving on a public school board and
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
representing as a non- voting member
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
shall be selected so I think this
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
balances out the board it gives um at
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
least some uh input from people who are
 
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
currently working with schools or have
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh recently working with schools and I
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
would hope that that retired teacher
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
might be the teacher of the year but um
 
02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
I would kind of gave that up um and um I
 
02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
think having a student and a parent on
 
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
the board is is going to offer a lot of
 
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
insight and and balance to the board and
 
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
um I know on local school boards the
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
students uh that serve offer a good
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
perspective and are very important on
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
school boards and um so I'm offering
 
02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:47.590 align:start position:0%
school boards and um so I'm offering
this

02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:27:51.230 --> 02:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
Miler okay represent cordelli thank you
 
02:27:58.830 --> 02:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
um the first problem I I see with the
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is that uh you would have a
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
student uh who is on a local school
 
02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
board as a non- voting member now being
 
02:28:10.030 --> 02:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
on the State Board of Education as a
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
voting member as a as a non voting non
 
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
voting uh the way I read it is a student
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
who's serving on Public School Board as
 
02:28:20.349 --> 02:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
a non-voting member shall be
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
selected I I take it to read there onest
 
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's right on a local school board as
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
a non- voting member yeah that's the way
 
02:28:32.429 --> 02:28:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:36.150 --> 02:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
it further discussion represent
 
02:28:39.710 --> 02:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
Damon um in response to representative
 
02:28:43.870 --> 02:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
cordell's remark so if the amendment
 
02:28:47.469 --> 02:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
were adjusted to specify that the
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
student was non- Voting would that be
 
02:28:52.269 --> 02:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
acceptable that was just my
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
first but the answer to the question
 
02:28:57.469 --> 02:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
acceptable the amendment still would not
 
02:28:59.439 --> 02:29:00.710 align:start position:0%
acceptable the amendment still would not
be

02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:29:04.030 --> 02:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable represent Bel thank you Mr
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
shair and to follow up on that that same
 
02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
line from rep cordelli um if it is a
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
voting member that would seem to be a
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
problem to me but if it's not a voting
 
02:29:16.830 --> 02:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
member then we actually only have we're
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
going from Seven votes to 10 votes which
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
is an even number which puts us in a
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
position to have stalemates coming out
 
02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:25.910 align:start position:0%
position to have stalemates coming out
of

02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.990 --> 02:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
this further discussion represent
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
dry thank you so I'm I'm curious as to
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
why I changed it from governor and
 
02:29:37.309 --> 02:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
councel shall point point to governor
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
Council why I change that um because
 
02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's I'm sorry that that's the way it
 
02:29:51.870 --> 02:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
should it should be stated rather than
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
the governor and executive Council shall
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
appoint um it should be with the consent
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
consent further discussion representa
 
02:30:08.469 --> 02:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair uh question
 
02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:30:13.389 --> 02:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
representative the word current is used
 
02:30:16.830 --> 02:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
as a parent who is current of a public
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
school student and a student who is
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
currently serving my question is if it's
 
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
a freear term what happens when the
 
02:30:26.349 --> 02:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
student graduates or the parent their
 
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
child perhaps chooses to go to a
 
02:30:31.309 --> 02:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
non-public school are they still on this
 
02:30:33.150 --> 02:30:33.160 align:start position:0%
committee if they're no longer current
 
02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
is it current at the time of selection
 
02:30:37.389 --> 02:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
or current for the entire three years of
 
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
the term they would be fulfilling their
 
02:30:43.269 --> 02:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
term of three years thank you further
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
02:30:45.439 --> 02:30:46.990 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
amendment

02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
gra gson whitcock question to the chair
 
02:30:53.269 --> 02:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh on a memo like this if if uh and
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
listening to represent quell's comment
 
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
if the inclusion of a comma would
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
satisfy the amendment uh in terms of
 
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
that concern inion of what a comma
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
gramar grammatical yeah is that is that
 
02:31:10.670 --> 02:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
typically done um by Os or before it
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
goes into to
 
02:31:16.110 --> 02:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
our sometimes a comma is very important
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe extremely important so that
 
02:31:21.389 --> 02:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
tyly done the grammatical correction
 
02:31:21.399 --> 02:31:23.030 align:start position:0%
tyly done the grammatical correction
down

02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
there but the question represent leas
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
I'm talking to Chairman last if you can
 
02:31:31.870 --> 02:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
read that two different ways you know
 
02:31:35.230 --> 02:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
due to the comma then it's not a simple
 
02:31:37.269 --> 02:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
change on the part of legislative
 
02:31:40.429 --> 02:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
Services okay so it would have to have
 
02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have certainly made that
 
02:31:44.990 --> 02:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
change before taking action okay can as
 
02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
yes if in some other Bill if it was just
 
02:31:50.510 --> 02:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
a simple grammatical change would
 
02:31:52.429 --> 02:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
typically legis it's just a question for
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
me chairman would legis typically
 
02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:55.630 align:start position:0%
me chairman would legis typically
correct

02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
that yeah if it was a spelling area
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
Okay problem or if it was wrong tense of
 
02:32:07.389 --> 02:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
a verb right maybe okay because you know
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
past or present or future could be
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
interpreted so it has to be very very
 
02:32:14.429 --> 02:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
small technical correction okay thank
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
you appreciate it
 
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
amendment I see on the amendment I still
 
02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
raised the question here now you have
 
02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
from one person from the New Hampshire
 
02:32:33.550 --> 02:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:35.469 --> 02:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
Association yeah we have a lot of
 
02:32:39.309 --> 02:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
associations out there and um why why
 
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
was this one picked vers you know Nea or
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
why uh not the New Hampshire school
 
02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
board s
 
02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:56.269 --> 02:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
they so I I I I still I guess my first
 
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
discussion is is appr propo to this
 
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
well further discussion on the amendment
 
02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:05.910 align:start position:0%
well further discussion on the amendment
represent

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
Amon thank you Mr
 
02:33:11.710 --> 02:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
chair I've been reflecting on the
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
remarks made so far and thinking about
 
02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
the experience of being on this
 
02:33:20.670 --> 02:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
committee and how
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
routinely one or more of us from the
 
02:33:27.870 --> 02:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
chair to anybody seated here ask for
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
input from our
 
02:33:34.510 --> 02:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
members who have worked in schools and
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
learn from and benefit including with
 
02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
great respect Mr chair you reference
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
your career experiences very helpfully
 
02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
and usefully every day I just really
 
02:33:49.630 --> 02:33:49.640 align:start position:0%
don't understand why we wouldn't
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:59.269 --> 02:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
doe as member of the legislature we're
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
here to make
 
02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
law that's not the responsibility of the
 
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education they're in the
 
02:34:13.230 --> 02:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
executive the management side of of how
 
02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
we function as a
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
country and they're
 
02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:19.550 align:start position:0%
country and they're
also

02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:34:21.630 --> 02:34:21.640 align:start position:0%
representing possibly various
 
02:34:23.469 --> 02:34:23.479 align:start position:0%
associations or groups according to the
 
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
way this would be written right here and
 
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
I think we want to eliminate conflict of
 
02:34:30.030 --> 02:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
interest and certainly if there's a
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest on a house bill the
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
person is going to have a fiscal gain
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
from that they have to recuse themselves
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
from that action um
 
02:34:44.269 --> 02:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
so I guess that you know I I I think
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
that it's important to have a a body
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
such as this which can have people that
 
02:34:53.269 --> 02:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
are elected coming from various
 
02:34:55.870 --> 02:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
professions that's fine and that can
 
02:34:58.030 --> 02:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
happen too with the State Board too be
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
by being appointed there we've had
 
02:35:02.110 --> 02:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
people in the past that have educator
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
backgrounds we just don't have it maybe
 
02:35:06.429 --> 02:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
right now maybe they're having they have
 
02:35:07.950 --> 02:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
it from some other perspective I don't
 
02:35:10.030 --> 02:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
know the background of all the people on
 
02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
the state board right now I don't know
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
it so I can't speak to
 
02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
it so I'm I'm not going to ser stand in
 
02:35:19.630 --> 02:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
judgment whether they do or do not
 
02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
possess understandings of how schools
 
02:35:24.750 --> 02:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:29.469 --> 02:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
state yeah represent Tanner so on our
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
current state school board I think we do
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
have members that are uh working for
 
02:35:38.389 --> 02:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
groups that are lobbyist groups um so I
 
02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
think that um I I think that the
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
administrators are so vital to whether
 
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
they're superintendents or principles or
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
however they're in administration are so
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
vital to the decisions that the State
 
02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
Board of Education makes and even though
 
02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's will be a a 10 group here we are 20
 
02:36:01.710 --> 02:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
group 1010
 
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
55 uh we know how that comes out so um I
 
02:36:08.910 --> 02:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh those two issues are kind
 
02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:10.510 align:start position:0%
think that uh those two issues are kind
of

02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
subis I'm not going to stand here in
 
02:36:14.190 --> 02:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
Judgment of the people on the State
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
Board I think they're all there because
 
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
they want to have the best possible
 
02:36:19.150 --> 02:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
education system in the state of New
 
02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:21.030 align:start position:0%
education system in the state of New
Hampshire

02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
period And I don't think anybody out
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
there's trying to represent one group or
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
another group they're representing
 
02:36:29.710 --> 02:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
various they have certainly everybody
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
here at on on this table has different
 
02:36:34.469 --> 02:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
perspectives and how to see an issue but
 
02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
we're all here in education because we
 
02:36:39.070 --> 02:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
believe that education is important
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're all there on the State Board
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
because they believe education is
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
important in the state they may not be
 
02:36:47.469 --> 02:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
coming from the same perspective of
 
02:36:47.479 --> 02:36:48.510 align:start position:0%
coming from the same perspective of
another

02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
group well that's that's going to happen
 
02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
you know we we often times have this you
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
know you're damned if you do damned if
 
02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:56.030 align:start position:0%
know you're damned if you do damned if
you

02:36:56.030 --> 02:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:36:58.830 --> 02:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
don't and that's just part of our
 
02:37:01.389 --> 02:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
democracy and that if you don't like it
 
02:37:04.349 --> 02:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
that's what you have The Ballot Box
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
for represent Bel thank you Mr chair I
 
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify my my belief on
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
on this so if I were receptive generally
 
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
to the concept of uh expanding the
 
02:37:17.950 --> 02:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
school board something like what's
 
02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
changed here to a retired classroom
 
02:37:21.469 --> 02:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
teacher instead of an currently employed
 
02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
one that goes a long way towards solving
 
02:37:25.950 --> 02:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
my problem with that particular position
 
02:37:28.349 --> 02:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
however then we introduce a parent with
 
02:37:30.750 --> 02:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
a a parent with a student currently in
 
02:37:33.309 --> 02:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
school which that creates a possible
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
special uh special interest that is
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
different that could be different from
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
the general interest then we go on and
 
02:37:41.790 --> 02:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
and we add I mean these are this is a
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
lobbyist organization when they come in
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
here they wear The Red Badge and we
 
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
would be mandating the president
 
02:37:47.469 --> 02:37:47.479 align:start position:0%
presence of one of them again that
 
02:37:50.590 --> 02:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
creates a conflict of interests so I
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
don't think I have a problem I don't
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
think most people in here probably don't
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the concept of
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
people having an educational background
 
02:37:57.790 --> 02:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
on the committee but it's that perverse
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
incentive that is created by putting
 
02:38:01.630 --> 02:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
people in positions that could have an
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
interest that differs from the general
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
will in such a way that it creates
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
conflict that's that's where I would see
 
02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:09.269 align:start position:0%
conflict that's that's where I would see
a

02:38:09.269 --> 02:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
problem further discussion represent
 
02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
leus couple comments one is yes yes we
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
have an even number and yes we have 10
 
02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
10 but we are not the final say it goes
 
02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:23.150 align:start position:0%
10 but we are not the final say it goes
to

02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
the it goes to session we have another
 
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
whole thing and another whole vote and
 
02:38:29.950 --> 02:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's unlik you
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
know and that's even set up so that
 
02:38:36.429 --> 02:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
generally we don't have a
 
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
tie although occasionally we do um but
 
02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
the other one is the school board is
 
02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
kind of the balance to us so we have as
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
part of the legislative branch yes we
 
02:38:53.309 --> 02:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
have most people in this room are
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
Educators whether they're public school
 
02:38:59.070 --> 02:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
home school whatever just most people in
 
02:39:01.389 --> 02:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
here are Educators and so that's sort of
 
02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
the representation of the schools the
 
02:39:06.870 --> 02:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
system the teacher you know Etc and so
 
02:39:09.150 --> 02:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
the school board is our
 
02:39:11.429 --> 02:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
counterbalance any further discussion on
 
02:39:11.439 --> 02:39:12.150 align:start position:0%
counterbalance any further discussion on
the

02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%

03:52:33.920 --> 03:52:38.030 align:start position:0%
intent of um the uh requirement to
inform

03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:40.750 --> 03:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
parents is there
 
03:52:44.790 --> 03:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
a um any discussion from the maker of
 
03:52:46.830 --> 03:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
the second represent
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
leus no thank you further discussion
 
03:52:53.070 --> 03:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:52:55.229 --> 03:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
committee everybody's reading it trying
 
03:52:58.389 --> 03:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
to wake up here represent
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
bone um yeah I have a lot of questions
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
about this in terms of what exactly it's
 
03:53:08.710 --> 03:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do um one of the uh persons
 
03:53:10.550 --> 03:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
that came up and spoke to it was talking
 
03:53:13.229 --> 03:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
about the data that was being released
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
and referencing a particular uh a study
 
03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
that keing state had done and I'm
 
03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if uh the representative could
 
03:53:25.870 --> 03:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
share a little more light as to why this
 
03:53:29.229 --> 03:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
is needed and particularly it was it
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear what actual information is
 
03:53:31.840 --> 03:53:33.790 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear what actual information is
being

03:53:33.790 --> 03:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:53:38.590 --> 03:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
shared um do do do I discuss this in the
 
03:53:40.630 --> 03:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
context to the whole bill or just stick
 
03:53:41.870 --> 03:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
amendment well for purposes right here
 
03:53:47.149 --> 03:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
stick to the amendment but also if you
 
03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
show how it relates to the bill okay yes
 
03:53:54.149 --> 03:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
um going back uh to the bill um you know
 
03:54:01.710 --> 03:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
I I can provide the information from
 
03:54:06.309 --> 03:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
furpa um if you want uh that's uh in uh
 
03:54:11.790 --> 03:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
c one on lines 5 through uh 8 uh talking
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
about furpa um and uh furpa was uh
 
03:54:17.229 --> 03:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
revised in
 
03:54:20.309 --> 03:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
2011 um loosened considerably in terms
 
03:54:24.349 --> 03:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
of uh the availabil availability of a
 
03:54:26.750 --> 03:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
student identifiable
 
03:54:30.510 --> 03:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
information and um that's why I felt
 
03:54:34.510 --> 03:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
that the need to um at least notify
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
parents when personally identifiable
 
03:54:39.269 --> 03:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
information was being released um and
 
03:54:43.229 --> 03:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
that's in section two and modified in uh
 
03:54:47.469 --> 03:54:47.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we just passed out um
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
yeah student excuse me schools are
 
03:54:54.349 --> 03:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
Contracting um with third parties um
 
03:54:56.269 --> 03:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
such as the the one that was mentioned
 
03:54:59.070 --> 03:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
the Behavioral Institute at ke State um
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
for various services and uh in some
 
03:55:04.950 --> 03:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
cases sharing uh personally identifiable
 
03:55:08.269 --> 03:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
information and that is um allowable
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
under number of
 
03:55:14.269 --> 03:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances um by uh furpa these days
 
03:55:16.950 --> 03:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
and um there's not much I can I can do
 
03:55:20.830 --> 03:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
about that so um I think uh um the next
 
03:55:23.550 --> 03:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
best thing is to at least notify parents
 
03:55:26.229 --> 03:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
when their students data is being shared
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
with a third
 
03:55:30.349 --> 03:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
party that's the
 
03:55:33.670 --> 03:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
intent represent TNA or represent Bon
 
03:55:35.229 --> 03:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
did you have a
 
03:55:37.990 --> 03:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
followup uh yes I guess I there's there
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
are already
 
03:55:43.469 --> 03:55:43.479 align:start position:0%
some other uh ways that that personally
 
03:55:45.990 --> 03:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
identified identifiable information are
 
03:55:48.189 --> 03:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
already regulated there's the children's
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
internet protection act the health
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
insurance portability and accountability
 
03:55:55.750 --> 03:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
act payment card industry data security
 
03:55:58.830 --> 03:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
standard and New Hampshire State rsas
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
and I'll list a bunch of them here but I
 
03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
guess my point is it seems to me that
 
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
there already is a lot of regulation in
 
03:56:08.830 --> 03:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
how that data can be used and I believe
 
03:56:10.750 --> 03:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
school districts are following those
 
03:56:13.710 --> 03:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
policies um I just to follow up if I
 
03:56:16.229 --> 03:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
might um I don't believe that Hippa
 
03:56:20.469 --> 03:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
applies to schools um secondly um some
 
03:56:23.389 --> 03:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
of those rsas that you just mentioned I
 
03:56:26.710 --> 03:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
wrote so I'm I'm well aware of um the
 
03:56:29.229 --> 03:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
requirements um in terms of directory
 
03:56:31.750 --> 03:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
information and so forth um and I
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
certainly hope there're being followed
 
03:56:34.830 --> 03:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
because one of the provisions in a
 
03:56:37.309 --> 03:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
number of those sections of law is that
 
03:56:38.990 --> 03:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh in the handbooks student
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
handbook um including uh copies of furpa
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't think that completely
 
03:56:48.990 --> 03:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
addresses um the thirdparty release of
 
03:56:51.870 --> 03:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
information and um that's why I wanted
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
to bring this
 
03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
forward representative Tanner and then
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden thank you I I
 
03:57:00.990 --> 03:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
have two questions one is does this
 
03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
restrict local schools and school
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
districts uh from working with student
 
03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
data um that was the purpose of the
 
03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it clear that uh they
 
03:57:16.349 --> 03:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh are allowed to uh share information
 
03:57:19.750 --> 03:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
as required by Statute in in most cases
 
03:57:22.110 --> 03:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
um with the Department of Education and
 
03:57:24.309 --> 03:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
that was a request of the department to
 
03:57:27.189 --> 03:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
make that clear my question was within
 
03:57:30.110 --> 03:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
the school and the district itself I
 
03:57:32.590 --> 03:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
don't think so I I don't think that's uh
 
03:57:35.189 --> 03:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh sharing information with third
 
03:57:38.309 --> 03:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
parties if it's within the school or a
 
03:57:40.870 --> 03:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
school District yeah sure okay and and
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
my my second question is needs both
 
03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.269 --> 03:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
off I'm not following your question I
 
03:57:52.630 --> 03:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
don't think the notification is it to
 
03:57:52.640 --> 03:57:54.670 align:start position:0%
don't think the notification is it to
both

03:57:54.670 --> 03:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:57:58.429 --> 03:57:58.439 align:start position:0%
parents or guardians or parents or
 
03:58:01.469 --> 03:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
guardians but both parents because
 
03:58:04.710 --> 03:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:09.189 --> 03:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
issue the uh primary um uh parent who is
 
03:58:10.950 --> 03:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh responsible for the child and has
 
03:58:13.269 --> 03:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
custody of the
 
03:58:16.830 --> 03:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
cascad um so I I had two questions um
 
03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
this additional language does it um make
 
03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
furpa more
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
regulated or does it add more than what
 
03:58:34.429 --> 03:58:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:34.439 --> 03:58:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
requires

03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:37.520 --> 03:58:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:41.550 --> 03:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
I I think it
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the parental notification is not in
 
03:58:48.910 --> 03:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
for so this would be something
 
03:58:52.590 --> 03:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
beyond your your mic's not oh I'm sorry
 
03:58:55.349 --> 03:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh so yes it's it's not required under
 
03:58:58.750 --> 03:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
furpa yeah yes go ahead um so when I'm
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
thinking about third party I'm also
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
thinking about um the
 
03:59:05.870 --> 03:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
online progress monitoring and screening
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
tools that schools purchase like in the
 
03:59:09.149 --> 03:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
AM web or
 
03:59:10.950 --> 03:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
used to buy the Dibbles or the newer
 
03:59:13.750 --> 03:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
Dibbles so is that considered a third
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
party because we feed student data into
 
03:59:16.560 --> 03:59:17.950 align:start position:0%
party because we feed student data into
that

03:59:17.950 --> 03:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:20.269 --> 03:59:20.279 align:start position:0%
system I'm thinking of that and what
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
about colleges don't they have
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
conversations with guidance counselers
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
back and forth I I think that's covered
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
under other areas of Statute
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
um uh but just um if I could refer back
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
to um representative Tanner's question
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
um under I can share this with you this
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
is an a student guide for relation to
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
furpa and there's a section under the
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:53.830 --> 03:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
exception represent
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you um I would like to ask a
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
question so if a school district
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
lists on their parent square or where
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
wherever they list it on the website
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere a list of the apps that are
 
04:00:09.870 --> 04:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
approved by the district is that
 
04:00:12.510 --> 04:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
considered parental consent that they
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
on um yeah um I'm not sure
 
04:00:27.309 --> 04:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
um why where the listing of an app or
 
04:00:29.670 --> 04:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
anything on the website would require
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
parental consent no but would it count
 
04:00:35.070 --> 04:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
as parental consent would it count as
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
they're all set the school district's
 
04:00:38.830 --> 04:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
all set they they put a list out of
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
approved apps on their Chromebooks are
 
04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
they good to go parents have been
 
04:00:44.349 --> 04:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
notified since it's on their website
 
04:00:45.950 --> 04:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's another statute that deals with
 
04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
online systems
 
04:00:53.070 --> 04:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
um um and I can it's 18
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
18965 I believe that deals with online
 
04:01:00.670 --> 04:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
systems so can I follow up um so during
 
04:01:03.670 --> 04:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
testimony you spoke of Grants
 
04:01:04.990 --> 04:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
specifically I think you were talking
 
04:01:06.990 --> 04:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
about and then Anar Banfield got up and
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
spoke about the app so
 
04:01:10.750 --> 04:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
what she spoke about you think that was
 
04:01:13.070 --> 04:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
not really what you were talking about
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't remember the detail of
 
04:01:18.870 --> 04:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
her testimony in terms of apps but um
 
04:01:21.990 --> 04:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
that uh you know that would not be
 
04:01:24.030 --> 04:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
something that I'm considering in this
 
04:01:25.790 --> 04:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
okay so that's why it was confusion
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
thank you represent cascaden um thank
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
you just another um Clarity in my mind
 
04:01:34.349 --> 04:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
so you pointed out School official is
 
04:01:37.149 --> 04:01:37.159 align:start position:0%
exempt from consent requirement so I
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
hear reference of data being provided to
 
04:01:44.349 --> 04:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
Keen I'm not really sure what data
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
you're talking about or what's provided
 
04:01:51.670 --> 04:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
to Keen is it a program I mean I don't
 
04:01:54.990 --> 04:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
know but I just wonder if it's a school
 
04:01:57.229 --> 04:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
official providing that then why is
 
04:01:59.630 --> 04:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
there a need for this and if not I mean
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
again I I don't know what what the issue
 
04:02:07.590 --> 04:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
is here um there is uh a I believe the
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
name is beh Al Institute um part of keen
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
state that does provide services um to
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
students uh in um in schools um and it
 
04:02:22.510 --> 04:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that um part of that
 
04:02:24.750 --> 04:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh is sharing of confidential
 
04:02:27.469 --> 04:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
information that's just one example that
 
04:02:31.990 --> 04:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm um I've been uh made aware of um but
 
04:02:34.830 --> 04:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
I think any information like that that
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
is being shared with um contractor or
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
this Falls within the exception under
 
04:02:46.590 --> 04:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
furpa um I I can find that and read it
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
to you
 
04:02:51.309 --> 04:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
um contractors that are performing a
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
service for the school for instance is
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
one of the exceptions um providing in
 
04:03:00.229 --> 04:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
student information to those uh third
 
04:03:03.630 --> 04:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
parties is what is allowed under
 
04:03:03.640 --> 04:03:05.510 align:start position:0%
parties is what is allowed under
furpa

04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
furpa
 
04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
um and that is the focus of in that in
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
those cases when they are providing that
 
04:03:13.710 --> 04:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
in student information to a third party
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
um then I think the parent should be
 
04:03:18.110 --> 04:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
notified that they are doing
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
that it's I I think um you know we talk
 
04:03:24.510 --> 04:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
about parental involvement and
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
everything but um if um their child's
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
information is providing being provided
 
04:03:34.149 --> 04:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
to non-school
 
04:03:37.590 --> 04:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
officials um as allowed under furpa then
 
04:03:38.990 --> 04:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think at at least they should know
 
04:03:39.000 --> 04:03:43.590 align:start position:0%
I think at at least they should know
about

04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
it yes represent bbon um my question is
 
04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.110 --> 04:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
schools why is this necessary are
 
04:04:03.269 --> 04:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
parents complaining that something's
 
04:04:03.279 --> 04:04:04.309 align:start position:0%
parents complaining that something's
going

04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:04:04.319 --> 04:04:06.990 align:start position:0%
going
on

04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:04:07.000 --> 04:04:08.990 align:start position:0%
on
um

04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
a year or so ago I I did um receive s
 
04:04:13.439 --> 04:04:14.309 align:start position:0%
a year or so ago I I did um receive s
such

04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
such
 
04:04:14.319 --> 04:04:16.670 align:start position:0%
such
information

04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:04:20.149 --> 04:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
um how widespread these contracts are in
 
04:04:22.830 --> 04:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
school districts I have I have no idea
 
04:04:27.990 --> 04:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
um but I think this is um uh at minimum
 
04:04:32.389 --> 04:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
precautionary um and um needed so that
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
parents can be involved in their kids'
 
04:04:37.469 --> 04:04:37.479 align:start position:0%
education and should should at least be
 
04:04:40.750 --> 04:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
aware if information is being provided
 
04:04:44.229 --> 04:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%

04:05:00.750 --> 04:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
doing if if uh confidential information
 
04:05:02.910 --> 04:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
if confidential information is being
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
available and it's um allowed under one
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the exceptions to furpa
 
04:05:09.840 --> 04:05:11.229 align:start position:0%

Miler so I guess I'm kind of in the dark

here thank you Mr chair what kind of
 
04:05:22.840 --> 04:05:22.850 align:start position:0%
information are we talking
 
04:05:22.850 --> 04:05:24.870 align:start position:0%

about

04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:05:31.149 --> 04:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
um I think elsewhere in statute um it's
 
04:05:34.910 --> 04:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
um we have what's defined as personal
 
04:05:34.920 --> 04:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
um we have what's defined as personal
identifiable

04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
identifiable
 
04:05:36.880 --> 04:05:42.030 align:start position:0%

04:05:44.070 --> 04:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
social security number address things
 
04:05:44.080 --> 04:05:46.830 align:start position:0%
social security number address things
like

04:05:46.830 --> 04:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%

y

04:05:56.790 --> 04:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
sociality that
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
may represent Tanner thank you um so
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
this is the Behavioral Institute at Keen
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
that that uh brought up the the problem
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
and they didn't bring up the problem but
 
04:06:17.469 --> 04:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
the was released
 
04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
aware their work for a number of school
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
dist okay and and what exactly is the
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
nature of their work for the different
 
04:06:24.399 --> 04:06:26.670 align:start position:0%
nature of their work for the different
school

04:06:26.670 --> 04:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:06:26.680 --> 04:06:29.870 align:start position:0%
school
districts

04:06:29.870 --> 04:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't remember um specifically I
 
04:06:33.520 --> 04:06:34.790 align:start position:0%
I I don't remember um specifically I
never

04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
never
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
saw well it says behavioral Institute so
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
is it connected to some program that's
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
currently in in schools that they would
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
contract with this is it part of the
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
discipline the what is it m Mt
 
04:06:54.110 --> 04:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
mtssb mtssb is it connected with that uh
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
I am not sure if it's connecting with
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
not but but again that's you know one
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
example I'm I'm concerned about the
 
04:07:09.149 --> 04:07:09.159 align:start position:0%
broader picture um you know because
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
clearly it is allowed under furpa that
 
04:07:15.550 --> 04:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
um there are exceptions in terms of
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
providing um information on students
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
um and this is trying to uh we we talk
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
about guard rails this isn't exactly a
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
guard rails but an information rail if
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
you will for parents represent
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
leus just making sure I understand this
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
does not in any way stop these things
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
from going on Etc it doesn't require
 
04:07:46.750 --> 04:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
permission it all still happens all this
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
does is let the parents know that yes we
 
04:07:50.040 --> 04:07:51.030 align:start position:0%
does is let the parents know that yes we
provided

04:07:51.030 --> 04:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:07:56.229 --> 04:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
information to this entity of this type
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
of your children is that it does not
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
prevent anything from going on um it
 
04:08:03.550 --> 04:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
just lets parents know that it's going
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
on thank
 
04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
you further discussion from the
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Bon um yes um I
 
04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
had reached out to a superintendent to
 
04:08:17.830 --> 04:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
find out more about this and uh she had
 
04:08:19.710 --> 04:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
told me that U most of the school
 
04:08:21.630 --> 04:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
districts uh participate in the New
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire data privacy
 
04:08:25.710 --> 04:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
Consortium um and they only work with
 
04:08:27.149 --> 04:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
vendors who can meet the standards for
 
04:08:28.990 --> 04:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining dat data
 
04:08:31.510 --> 04:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
privacy um and if vendors don't agree to
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
those terms the districts are advised to
 
04:08:36.269 --> 04:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
seek explicit parental
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
consent yes that that's in statute also
 
04:08:42.030 --> 04:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
under governance um
 
04:08:42.040 --> 04:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
under governance um
requirements

04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:08:47.950 --> 04:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
yeah further discussion from the
 
04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:08:52.030 --> 04:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair so just
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
following up on that last inquiry and
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
answer it's not clear to
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
me if we have the New Hampshire data
 
04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
privacy Consortium standards and its in
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
statute for schools
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
to um align with that
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
it seems that like that addresses this
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
situation or this concern
 
04:09:14.399 --> 04:09:16.269 align:start position:0%
situation or this concern
rather

04:09:16.269 --> 04:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
rather
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
um I I think that that's more in line
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
that the um the agency will protect that
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
data um it does not say that information
 
04:09:33.790 --> 04:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
cannot be shared with that um uh
 
04:09:36.990 --> 04:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
institution um or vendor um this is
 
04:09:39.550 --> 04:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
saying that that um the information can
 
04:09:42.510 --> 04:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
be shared with those vendors if they
 
04:09:44.830 --> 04:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
qualify under
 
04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
furpa um it's just saying if we do
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
provide if they do send that information
 
04:09:54.189 --> 04:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:56.750 --> 04:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
know further discussion from the
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Damon thank you
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
just one
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
more so if a school district informed
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
parents either by way of the student
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
hand book or by a notification at the
 
04:10:10.990 --> 04:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
beginning of the
 
04:10:11.000 --> 04:10:12.790 align:start position:0%
beginning of the
year

04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:10:16.269 --> 04:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
of their usual practices in terms of
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
sharing uh this information would that
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
be adequate or are is the bill asking
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
for individual notifications to every
 
04:10:26.319 --> 04:10:27.349 align:start position:0%
for individual notifications to every
parent

04:10:27.349 --> 04:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:10:30.189 --> 04:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
ongoing um or something in between the
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
um the language um is that uh if it's
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
information is released within 14 days
 
04:10:40.429 --> 04:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
they have to notify the parent of what
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
information was released to Who and the
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
educational Ser purpose for which it is
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
being provided which is um in accordance
 
04:10:49.359 --> 04:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
being provided which is um in accordance
with

04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
fura are there
 
04:10:58.990 --> 04:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
additional questions or discussion from
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
the committee represent
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
leus so this is just part of that

that correct uh that is my
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
intent further if I just point out um
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative Hall I think was talking
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
about some online apps and so forth uh
 
04:11:31.070 --> 04:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:33.870 --> 04:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
68-a further
 
04:11:36.149 --> 04:11:36.159 align:start position:0%

district um those are exceptions um and
 
04:12:50.429 --> 04:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
so this is trying to address the
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
exceptions to
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%

04:13:03.149 --> 04:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
furpa um have those exceptions for third
 
04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
party I wish I
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
knew so Ju Just just a just a followup
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we know though to make sure
 
04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
that we're not putting some roadblock up
 
04:13:16.750 --> 04:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
that breaks down maybe a very important
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
part of of Records transfer that affects
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
kids shouldn't we know uh know what I'm
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
not sure what what you just said I wish
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
we knew shouldn't we
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
know why why why allows has those
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions for third
 
04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
parties uh
 
04:13:40.830 --> 04:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
I I remember one of the exceptions is
 
04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
that the third party is performing a
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
service on behalf um of the um the
 
04:13:51.189 --> 04:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
district for educational purposes is one
 
04:13:54.109 --> 04:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
of the exceptions so with that as an
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
exception to the written consent for the
 
04:14:02.189 --> 04:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
release of information um this um at
 
04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
least notifies the
 
04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
parent okay so so
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
so so so could and I I I know there were
 
04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
other examples concerns with respect to
 
04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning and mtssb that
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
came up earlier but let's pick a pick
 
04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
another one let's say um Medicaid
 
04:14:27.030 --> 04:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:30.870 --> 04:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
should parent parents clearly are aware
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
that that that the child is receiving
 
04:14:38.109 --> 04:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
services in school the parent is
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
completely aware that the child is
 
04:14:44.269 --> 04:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enrolled because they had to
 
04:14:48.429 --> 04:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
consent to that and should the school
 
04:14:53.429 --> 04:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
district need to Bill CMS for um for
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services Services provided by
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
the school Under Medicaid um would this
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
then prevent such um you know such an
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
action by the by the school district I
 
04:15:14.030 --> 04:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.309 --> 04:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
so further discussion we'd want to
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
know further discussion from anybody
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%

motion represent
 
04:17:40.510 --> 04:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
luno sure um yeah I just think there's
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
there's too many things we don't know
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
about the problems that this um this
 
04:17:48.510 --> 04:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
bill um as proposed um could cause and I
 
04:17:51.030 --> 04:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
think this committee would benefit from
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
knowing what those those would be before
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
it proceeds to approve um something like
 
04:18:01.269 --> 04:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
this further discussion on the bill not
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
seeing mam clerk would you call Ro
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
please represent represent Caden sorry
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
I'm s not I just had to um my take on
 
04:18:12.910 --> 04:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
this in practice is
 
04:18:15.309 --> 04:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
that I would recommend people read
 
04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
school policies because this what this
 
04:18:21.309 --> 04:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
bill does I absolutely agree with parent
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
notification absolutely there shouldn't
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
be anything that happens in schools
 
04:18:27.070 --> 04:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
without parent notification and there
 
04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
are strict laws to follow that what this
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill does is to give the public a
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
perception that schools are not doing
 
04:18:35.550 --> 04:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to be doing and
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:42.750 --> 04:18:42.760 align:start position:0%

stud okay there's a motion to interim
study

04:19:31.469 --> 04:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
1695 is there a second represent Tanner
 
04:19:39.030 --> 04:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to caucus on this one
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
right now you don't want me to speak to
 
04:19:42.600 --> 04:19:44.630 align:start position:0%
right now you don't want me to speak to
it

04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:19:49.389 --> 04:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
first um sure if you want to speak well
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
I I guess I think the reason why I inter
 
04:19:55.389 --> 04:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
study this because obviously there
 
04:19:59.149 --> 04:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
there's concerns about allowing parents
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
information Etc but as we've had the
 
04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
conversation there is a lot of ambiguity
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
about what exactly what is it that we're
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
doing what's available and I just
 
04:20:12.309 --> 04:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
thought that rather than lose the
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
concept here and having to take this to
 
04:20:17.309 --> 04:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
the floor to have a debate on it that
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
keep it within the committee so we have
 
04:20:23.229 --> 04:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
a chance to have a convers a further um
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
clarification of exactly what we're
 
04:20:27.630 --> 04:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
talking about about here I mean we we've
 
04:20:29.630 --> 04:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
had a lot of bills here in this
 
04:20:31.149 --> 04:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
committee that deal with privacy and I
 
04:20:33.389 --> 04:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
think we're all concerned about privacy
 
04:20:35.229 --> 04:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
but I want to just make sure that we
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
understand the nature of what we're
 
04:20:39.790 --> 04:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
talking about what is allowed what's not
 
04:20:41.630 --> 04:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
allowed Etc and I think it would just
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
give us a little more time to have a
 
04:20:45.750 --> 04:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
further conversation on thank you Mr
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
okay with that we will go into
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
caucus shouldn't take too long we'll be
 
04:20:51.720 --> 04:21:05.429 align:start position:0%
caucus shouldn't take too long we'll be
right

04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:10.429 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.439 --> 04:31:15.469 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:18.630 --> 04:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
and deal is 1695 we do have a motion on
 
04:31:20.950 --> 04:31:20.960 align:start position:0%

04:31:34.630 --> 04:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have yet to speak on this
 
04:31:37.950 --> 04:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
bill and just want to say that I don't
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
believe there's anything more that needs
 
04:31:41.469 --> 04:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
to be studied and the people of New
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deserve a debate on this issue
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
I know I've had several constituents
 
04:31:47.590 --> 04:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
reach out to me in support of this bill
 
04:31:50.590 --> 04:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure other members against this bill
 
04:31:53.229 --> 04:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
and not with standing either side it
 
04:31:54.590 --> 04:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
should be debated that's what we're here
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
to do so I would like to send this to
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
the floor and I hope you vote against
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
