00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
army yes
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
the motion has passed yes
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
it is open for
 
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.749 align:start position:0%
it is open for
further

00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:34.629 align:start position:0%
further
well

00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
and at this point we need to we we're
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
reconsidering that the vote that we took
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
and that i voted for to adopt the
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and so now we need to take
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
that vote again
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
and this time
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
i will be voting no and would urge
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
everyone to do the same so voting on the
 
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.350 align:start position:0%
everyone to do the same so voting on the
amendment

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
and you're recommending itl on the
 
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.710 align:start position:0%
and you're recommending itl on the
amendment

00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.710 align:start position:0%
amendment
yes

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.269 align:start position:0%
yes
everyone

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
so first we had to reconsider the ought
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
second we have to reconsider
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
so we're now
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
reconsidered both of them so we're back
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
to where we were
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
we now have the amendment
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
which was brought forth
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we will vote that down
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh and then we can uh vote to adopt the
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
initial bill if you'd like so
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative alma has a question on
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
just that we aren't trying to itl the
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
amendment we're just not accepting the
 
00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:34.150 align:start position:0%
amendment we're just not accepting the
amendment

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
amendment
okay

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay so what is the motion
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
if it's not
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.310 align:start position:0%
if it's
motion

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.189 align:start position:0%
motion
right

00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
and we don't
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
i'm just having a brain cramp here let
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
me figure out so the amendments on the
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
table were voting against the amendment
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
you're just doing it the way you
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
normally would yeah okay sorry are you
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
correct it's not an ito
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
um do you know the amendment number by
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
chance i do i'll find it for you here
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
because everyone brought their packages
 
00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:24.710 align:start position:0%
because everyone brought their packages
right

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
you know i may have tossed it
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
it may have even
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
know if we had the paper copies on our
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
what is the amendment number
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.549 align:start position:0%
 
1835h

00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
yes i thought
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
because a senator it drafted the version
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
that was that was in front of us so it
 
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.870 align:start position:0%
that was that was in front of us so it
wasn't

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
that was another reason it was not
 
00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:41.590 align:start position:0%
that was another reason it was not
correct

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
1489 yes
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.440 --> 00:19:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor is
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
well we already adopted it
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
so what we have done now is we
 
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.070 align:start position:0%
so what we have done now is we
reconsidered

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
reconsidered
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
i think we have to
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
since we reconsidered the adoption we
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
we have to reconsider both there's a
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's okay it's good to have the
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
conversation about the procedure so we
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
passed a bill with an amendment so we
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
have to both reconsider the bill
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
as passed with the amendment and the
 
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
as passed with the amendment and the
amendment

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
so we reconsider them so now back in
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
front of us
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
is the bill as amended
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
or so now we have to
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
unamend it
 
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.669 align:start position:0%
unamend it
yeah

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
can mr chairman can the chairman just
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
rule that that amendment is non-germane
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
and since we haven't had a public
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
hearing that it can't be considered
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
the only reason i'm doing as i act have
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
i asked for specific instructions from
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
the house clerk okay so i would rather
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
we follow the explicit construction
 
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.549 align:start position:0%
we follow the explicit construction
follow

00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
the clerk okay
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
i already have two strikes against me so
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
and from that standpoint we're in the
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
voting mode we're in the process of
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
voting in this amendment and have been
 
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.830 align:start position:0%
voting in this amendment and have been
for

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
quite some time now and so we have to
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
finish what we're doing we can't just
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
stop and say ah let's forget this and do
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
something else mr chairman
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative move the question on
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.549 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
the the third go ahead representative
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
the motion of the floor is
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%

00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
version of the bill
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
because all it does is changes the
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements to make it clear
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
that the reports have to be delivered on
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
time and that they have to go to ways
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
and means in both the house and the
 
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.350 align:start position:0%
and means in both the house and the
senate

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.149 align:start position:0%
senate
so

00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
um in our discussion nobody had any
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
issue with this portion of the bill
 
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.789 align:start position:0%
issue with this portion of the bill
i

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh will therefore be voting yes to pass
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
the original version
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sullivan
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
seeing how representative almi is here
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
to supervise this process i would
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
yes i questioned as well why that bill
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
this bill came to us but oh well
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
we have more committees and i guess they
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
do so i don't know so anyone else like
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
to speak on behalf
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
of the ought to pass on house senate
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%

on with this piece of legislation and
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to do down there
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
which will probably be good for all of
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%

you mr chairman um there were some
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
questions as to whether we should be
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
expanding some of this to include uh
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
given the testimony that it was to or
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
from security details or to and from
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
off-duty details
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
to cover the time traveled between their
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
home and going home
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
also to include fish and game maybe the
 
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.110 align:start position:0%
also to include fish and game maybe the
sheriff's

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
sheriff's
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
office also has vehicles that are taken
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
home by their employees that are also
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
used for details or outside
 
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.590 align:start position:0%
used for details or outside
off-duty

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
off-duty
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
special details and security um also if
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's a local officer that leaves
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
their jurisdiction would they be covered
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
um those were the questions i had and
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
none of them were
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
seem to have any answers so that's the
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
reason for the interim study so we can
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
get answers and maybe expand this
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
to include
 
00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:47.830 align:start position:0%
to include
other

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
sullivan followed by representative
 
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.070 align:start position:0%
sullivan followed by representative
cahill

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
cahill
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
i frankly don't disagree with any of
 
00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:58.789 align:start position:0%
i frankly don't disagree with any of
that

00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:58.799 --> 00:25:59.909 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
however i
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
think we have an opportunity here to
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
solve a problem for the state police
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
and then if it needs to be expanded i
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
mean if we get answers to all those
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
questions um which we should
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
um and we find that we need to expand it
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
we can expand it with a new bill
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
um but if we pass this bill we can solve
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
a problem for the state police it seemed
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
like a legitimate problem seemed like
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know we would leave them still
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to not getting the workers
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
comp that they ought to
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
and if we pass it now we can solve one
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
problem if there are other problems to
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
be solved
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
next year's another year we can do that
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
um with a new bill
 
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.350 align:start position:0%
um with a new bill
so

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
i would uh vote against the uh
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
the interim study and would prefer not
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
to pass so that we can as i said solve
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
one problem and then later perhaps solve
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
others thank you
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative cahill followed by um
 
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.070 align:start position:0%
representative cahill followed by um
warden

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
warden
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and basically what
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
what he said but i you know we've this
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
problem has been identified and there
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
while there may be others and i agree
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
with mr avilani that we should look at
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
that but next year we could we could do
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
that we'll have the time and i think we
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
i would vote out to pass on
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
in reading the plain language of the
 
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.669 align:start position:0%
in reading the plain language of the
bill

00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
reads me by the way it says there shall
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
be a premium prima facie presumption
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
that any injury sustained by a troop
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
and to my
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
understanding and interpretation of that
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
plain language that only refers to the
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
trooper while operating the state police
 
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.310 align:start position:0%
trooper while operating the state police
vehicle

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
yet we heard a bunch of testimony in the
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
public hearing about
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
stopping for a detail or stopping for an
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
accident details slip and fall outside
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
the vehicle but this
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
clear definition here would only apply
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
to somebody behind the wheel
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
driving or operating that vehicle and
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
from the test point that wasn't the
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
intent so that's why i agree with the
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
idea of our interim study to really
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
drill down on this make sure we're all
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
on the same page of what the original
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
intent was and see if we can address
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.190 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
i am angry that i have to be the tying
 
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
i am angry that i have to be the tying
oh

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's poor legislation
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%

didn't receive a call back
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know what the impetus was
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
behind this
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
was there a claim denied is there a
 
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.470 align:start position:0%
was there a claim denied is there a
problem

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
i am a big supporter as you all know
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.549 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
surprised by
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
my fellow republicans with the concerns
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
the expeditious part of me said let's
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
just pass it and we'll fix it
 
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
just pass it and we'll fix it
well

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to solve
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
is it as soon as they get called because
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're closer to the closest
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
officer to the scene
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
or they happen to see something
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know see some
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
reckless drivers going whatever doing
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
crazy stuff and they have to respond
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
the current law allows for certain
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
things i mean
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
in current workers compensation law
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
if i have a job or i have to stop and
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
see four
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
clients during the day the minute i
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
leave my house i'm covered
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
to go see all those people no matter
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
what happens to me whether i slept in
 
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
the parking lot or i get in a car
 
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.029 align:start position:0%
the parking lot or i get in a car
accident

00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
accident
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
yet if i go to my office first i'm not
 
00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:13.669 align:start position:0%
yet if i go to my office first i'm not
um

00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of different
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
machinations and i don't think we've
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
covered them here what are they what are
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
they trying to solve
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
and it bothers
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
really bothers me
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:33.029 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
what are we passing and what are we
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
solving what was the problem that
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
started it
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
and what are we trying
 
00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:40.149 align:start position:0%
and what are we trying
to

00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
define and get covered i don't think
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's any question
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
that the people that are going to vote
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%

the whole thing was
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%

at every point
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh that this bill has been discussed in
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
a hearing whether it was senate commerce
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
or here
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
a week or two weeks ago um the concept
 
01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.390 align:start position:0%
a week or two weeks ago um the concept
of

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
a labor shortage has been
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
one way or another used as a
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
justification uh for the expansion of
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
ours um i'm very concerned that instead
 
01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.589 align:start position:0%
ours um i'm very concerned that instead
of

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
doing things like raising the minimum
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
wage uh having better workplace
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
protections um
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
doing anything to make the currently
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
unfilled jobs
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
actually more attractive to potential
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
applicants uh
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
the theory behind it seems to be in some
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
part well we'll just have the kids do
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
that um i don't like that i i've
 
01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.950 align:start position:0%
that um i don't like that i i've
expressed

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:51.750 align:start position:0%
expressed
my

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
concern that students being
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
out working that late
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh at 9 or 10 p.m
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
or 10 p.m is in the original language uh
 
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.630 align:start position:0%
or 10 p.m is in the original language uh
would

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
make it so that they have a difficult
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
time doing their homework especially if
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
they have a longer commute time
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
i know i grew up in bridgewater new
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i worked at the tilton
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
market basket um that was a 35 minute
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
drive easily um under the new
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
legislation i'd be getting home at about
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
10 30 10 40 10 45
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that's just too late so um
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think setting an 8 pm time is good um
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%

01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
seasonal businesses
 
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.270 align:start position:0%
seasonal businesses
and

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
this apparently is a year-round
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
restriction the way it's written
 
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.950 align:start position:0%
restriction the way it's written
and

01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
frankly that is impossible there's too
 
01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:02.069 align:start position:0%
frankly that is impossible there's too
many

01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
children who are youth who are perfectly
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
willing to work those hours the parents
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
are perfectly willing to have them work
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
those hours
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason we should be
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
restricting their ability to work those
 
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.910 align:start position:0%
restricting their ability to work those
hours

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%

chairman
uh

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
in in this amendment we we limit the
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
work for 16 and 17 year olds to
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh during the months in which school is
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
in session
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
now that may vary it may be that one one
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
place starts
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
after labor day another does the last
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
week of august but in either case
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's they're not in sessions so
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
if they're not in session they are free
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
to work unlimited hours but during the
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
time that the school is in session
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
then 16 to 17 year olds will not work
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
more than 35 hours
 
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.230 align:start position:0%
more than 35 hours
in

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.270 align:start position:0%
in
in

01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
the week other than the school's
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
vacation week so we know that those vary
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
but i think the employer
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
and the department would know when the
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
school is in session that in that
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
district that area and when their
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
vacation week occurs so outside of
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
outside when they're not in school
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
either through the school's vacation or
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
through the summer months
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
there's no limit on on their working
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
within those times 35 hours
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
and then we go on to talk about night
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
work so the uh they will be during the
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
school when school is in session they
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
could not work later than nine o'clock
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
which i think is better than 10 o'clock
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
which was in the original bill
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh sunday through thursday and could
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
work until 12 a.m on friday and saturday
 
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.349 align:start position:0%
work until 12 a.m on friday and saturday
nights

01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
nights
 
01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:42.150 align:start position:0%
nights
so

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
we're giving them the 35 hours that was
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
requested and we're just dialing back
 
01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.069 align:start position:0%
requested and we're just dialing back
uh

01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
from 10 to nine
 
01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.029 align:start position:0%
from 10 to nine
and

01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
making quite a bit simpler just asking
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
limiting the the
 
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.109 align:start position:0%
limiting the the
hours

01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
during the school when school is in
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
session which is the time we're trying
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're doing their
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
homework studying for the test preparing
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their working careers
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.109 align:start position:0%
thank you
seaworth

01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
seaworth
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll um
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
stick to section two since i'll talk to
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
section three next
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
um my concern here well i'll back up so
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
came to us from the senate
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
in an effort to
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
redu take areas of the law where there's
 
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.910 align:start position:0%
redu take areas of the law where there's
confusion

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
and burdens on the employers trying to
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
comply with how things are written
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
and and simplify that
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
to me section 2
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
in practice would be
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
pretty similar to what the the
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
suggests

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
but to me it's also more complicated it
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
has people trying to figure out these
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
things about whether it's a month when
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
school's in session when it's a week
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
that it's a school vacation week
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.270 align:start position:0%
i think
to

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
cut to the chase i think this adds
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
complexity to the regulation rather than
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
reduces it
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%

out of state goes to maine massachusetts
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
or vermont for schooling would we have
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
to follow their school year or we would
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.719 --> 01:08:45.510 align:start position:0%

when i see that penn
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
i know there's a good question coming
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
from mr avilani and i don't know the
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
answer and i don't know what happens
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have attitude you say is
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
there a giant difference between the
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
school years on one side of the
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
connecticut river and the other
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%

um if it's in a week other than a
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
school's vacation week we had discussion
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
of kids that are on work study
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
would they be able to partake in that
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
because it specifically says they
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to work one 35
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
35 hours only during a school vacation
 
01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:36.149 align:start position:0%
35 hours only during a school vacation
week

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i'm not
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
quite sure how the department looks at
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
work study if they are familiar with the
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
issue i'm sure they have a way to
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate that and not penalize the
 
01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.630 align:start position:0%
evaluate that and not penalize the
employer

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
or the young person who wants to work
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
i also do appreciate
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
i say this with sincerity uh
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative cahill's uh
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
amendments and intent and he and i with
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
a number of emails going back and forth
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
and while i agree with where he's trying
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
to go with this i i expressed that i am
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
concerned that it's not so much the
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's the employers themselves we heard
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
from a couple employers that there's a
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion in the law and the
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
whole goal is to make this more simple
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
and i do believe that that word month
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
it could be problematic um you know the
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
kid gets out two weeks
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
the second week of june and well that's
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
a school month well is that a vacation
 
01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.070 align:start position:0%
a school month well is that a vacation
week

01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
because it's school vacation is summer
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
actually school vacation summer i don't
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
know or is that just like no school
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
sessions so
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
i i i do appreciate it i'm i'm i can't
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
support it but i do appreciate what
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
you've done because i just think we're
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
trying to make it more
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
succinct and this may have just opened
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
it to be more confusing
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
while this might come up slightly short
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
of being perfectly clear
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that it is far more
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
clear than the current statute
 
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.470 align:start position:0%
clear than the current statute
which

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
i agree we heard lots of testimony maybe
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
not lots we've heard testimony that
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
employers are confused by the current
 
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.669 align:start position:0%
employers are confused by the current
statute

01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
and i believe this
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
amendment is far clearer than the
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
current statute is
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative did i say i was going to
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
recognize you and i didn't recognize you
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
i apologize sorry i just want to point
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
out that the west
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
has a different school vacation week
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh my
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
my question would be is how how would
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
this apply to homeschoolers uh they you
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
know they have different schooling hours
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
different vacations different everything
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing in this that
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
that applies to them
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i've
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
discussed that issue with deputy
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
ogden and he says that currently and i
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
imagine this would continue they look at
 
01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:25.189 align:start position:0%
imagine this would continue they look at
the

01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
district and where the student lives
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
so if you're in home school or you're in
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
your town it would be the same
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe this would encourage
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
people to
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
hollow the uh
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
hire the youth knowing that it's not
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's either summertime or it isn't
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
and it's a school vacation it's you know
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's twice a year that happens it's not
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
that difficult to follow and i did work
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
rather closely with mr ogden getting
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation prepared
 
01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.870 align:start position:0%
this legislation prepared
so

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%

you're recognized to speak to your
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
motion thank you and as i hinted now i
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
get to talk about the third section of
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
it was it was a number of terms ago we
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
had a bill with a lot of pieces that
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
came to this committee to deal with
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
youth employment
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
and during the testimony people kept
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
asking well is this bill gonna deal with
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
night work is this gonna fix night work
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
what are you gonna do about night work
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i thought to myself what what is
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
this night work
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
and sometimes i regret that i ever asked
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
that question because over the years i
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
came to learn a lot about night work
 
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.470 align:start position:0%
came to learn a lot about night work
um

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
i offer this amendment which is is very
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
short it repeals two sections of the law
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
the first one is the night work section
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's in a13 and then a14 it also
 
01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.110 align:start position:0%
that's in a13 and then a14 it also
repeals

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
repeals
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
the ability of the commissioner to give
 
01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.030 align:start position:0%
the ability of the commissioner to give
exceptions

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
to 213 so the two have to come together
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
and in doing this i think i've taken the
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
one common denominator to every
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that's um
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
that's come into this bill every single
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
amendment repeals the existing law
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
the existing night work law and this was
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
how it was written from the beginning
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's how it's held up through the
 
01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.390 align:start position:0%
it's how it's held up through the
amendments

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
is basically a restriction on overtime
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a complicated restriction
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
on overtime and then it has to do with
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
hours of work and number of days work
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
and and once you hit the right
 
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.709 align:start position:0%
and and once you hit the right
combination

01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
combination
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
then your shifts are limited to eight
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
hours a day but that's what it hits it's
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
not really
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
defining conditions for working at night
 
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.189 align:start position:0%
defining conditions for working at night
as

01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
the title might imply and the result of
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is that
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
employers either don't understand how it
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
applies and are afraid of it so they try
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
to stay away from the whole area or they
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
do understand
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
but it's too complicated for them to
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
keep track of all these moving pieces
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
and so they don't hire teens because of
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
fear of this law from the department of
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
labor we've heard that the problems are
 
01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:56.830 align:start position:0%
labor we've heard that the problems are
again

01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings people thinking that
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
there are laws that don't exist and
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
saying but isn't there this night work
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
and doesn't that do something and they
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
have to explain no so again the common
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
denominator was repealing this existing
 
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.110 align:start position:0%
denominator was repealing this existing
law

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
is supported across the board
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
in the underlying bill the senate has
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
put forth
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
something else not a limitation on
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
overtime as the law that's repealed is
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
but a new restriction kind of a curfew
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
on when
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
what hours
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 year olds can work and when
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
we heard during testimony we've talked
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
about in in as these amendments come
 
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
about in in as these amendments come
forward

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
it seems kind of that they didn't fully
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
think through the implication of what
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
they wrote
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
and i would argue this is
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
the problem is in the process that in
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
repealing to also then in add in a new
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
area of law that impacts
 
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.350 align:start position:0%
area of law that impacts
employers

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
students families in ways that we just
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
haven't thought through
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's a result from rushing it and i
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't think the right way to fix that
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
a senate rush job is for then us in the
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
house to try to throw something together
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
um over a holiday weekend
 
01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.149 align:start position:0%
um over a holiday weekend
so

01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to support this simple
 
01:18:27.199 --> 01:18:28.229 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to support this simple
repeal

01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's something we all agree on
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
um if a new bill is is desired that
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
wants to put more restrictions on teen
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
workers and employers
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
maybe that should be its own bill
 
01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.390 align:start position:0%
maybe that should be its own bill
um

01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
as i said i've spent a lot of years in
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
night work i i worked on the language
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's in there
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
i kind of felt that the night work would
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
be my legacy
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
that my contribution to the future of
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
would be night work
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
i am willing to let go of night work and
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
i asked my friends on the committee to
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
do the same
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
followed by sullivan
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh representative
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
seaworth if you'd mind answering uh just
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
to be clear under this language um
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
repealing the night work section it
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
would in fact be possible for a 16 year
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
old to work until 5am the following day
 
01:19:26.239 --> 01:19:29.030 align:start position:0%
old to work until 5am the following day
correct

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
that is correct and even if we don't
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
repeal it it would be possible for a
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
teenager to work until 5 00 pm the
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
following day
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
5 am five five a.m
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
no further
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
um one thing i will say for this it is
 
01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.070 align:start position:0%
um one thing i will say for this it is
simple

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
maybe a little too simple um
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
right now as i understand it from the
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
most employers because the current
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
statute is quite confusing and hard to
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
manage they simply don't have kids work
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
past eight um so if effectively um the
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
current language could read
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
no um
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
16 or 17 year olds shall work past 8 pm
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
on any day
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's being interpreted um
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
and or applied not interpreted um
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
the senate opened it up and said
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
let's put some limit on it
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
they tried to do it
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
10 p.m
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
on school nights i think they missed
 
01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.189 align:start position:0%
on school nights i think they missed
and

01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
12 a.m on
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
saturday or friday and saturday
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
then i think the senator acknowledged
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey acknowledged that
 
01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.629 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey acknowledged that
her

01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
i think having no limitations on night
 
01:20:54.159 --> 01:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
i think having no limitations on night
work

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.669 align:start position:0%
work
for

01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 year olds is a step too far
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i would suggest that some type of
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
limitation is appropriate um i could
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
live with i think eight o'clock is too
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
early um
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
i could live with nine o'clock i could
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
live a ten ten o'clock on a school night
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
i think 12 a.m on a friday and saturday
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
um is also just fine
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
i think no limitation is a step too far
 
01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:21.990 align:start position:0%
i think no limitation is a step too far
so

01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
i would not support
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
this very simple
 
01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.510 align:start position:0%
this very simple
amendment

01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman in researching um
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
to refresh myself seeing as this is my
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
first term in the labor committee and
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
i've had to learn a lot this year
 
01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:38.709 align:start position:0%
i've had to learn a lot this year
um

01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
i looked into what the federal um
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
labor laws are pertaining to 14 and 15
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
year olds the current maximum cap is 18
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
hours a week
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
and it's no earlier and no later than 7
 
01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
and it's no earlier and no later than 7
pm

01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
pm
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
under the proposed amendment
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
you would be going from a 15 year old
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
who is not allowed to work past
 
01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.790 align:start position:0%
who is not allowed to work past
7

01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
7
 
01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.070 align:start position:0%
7
pm

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
pm
 
01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:08.950 align:start position:0%
pm
to

01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
the day after they turn 16
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
devoid of any further context or changes
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
in their school workload
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh or anything else you have a student
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
that starts their junior year where
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're starting to take ap classes at
 
01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.550 align:start position:0%
they're starting to take ap classes at
15

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden they turn 16 and now
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no restriction to
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that an employer can
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
schedule them i'm not even going to say
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
that the kid can work it's the employer
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
can schedule them because we were all
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
here when deputy commissioner ogden sat
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
up there
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
and said oftentimes the department of
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
labor fields
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
calls from parents who say
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
well my kid got scheduled to work until
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
11 pm i don't want them working until 11
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
pm but i understand that if i complain
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
to the manager then my student will get
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
replaced by as he put it somebody else
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
who can
 
01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.550 align:start position:0%
who can
um

01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
i i recognize the amendment that i put
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
forward earlier um was a bit too much
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
for folks that's fine um but i also
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
think this is too far in the other
 
01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.470 align:start position:0%
think this is too far in the other
direction

01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else like to speak
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mike i did call i did
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
recognize my merchant of cahill followed
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
by avilani thank you mr chair uh i will
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
oppose this amendment i i think it is uh
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
way too far
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
we i we do have a responsibility to our
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
our children
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
and and and the employers to be fine to
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
balance and i think that during the
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
school year
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have people working late i
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
spoke to a parent this morning a parent
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
of twin boys
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
and he said he'd like them in bed at 10
 
01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:54.870 align:start position:0%
and he said he'd like them in bed at 10
o'clock

01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
he doesn't really want i mean whether we
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
know the kids may not be at 10 o'clock
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
they may be reading or doing
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
video games but they're home and they're
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
not at an employer which pulls them some
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
distance away working
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
until you know who knows what hour i
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
guess it could be 5 p and the next day
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
under this under this amendment
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
you could just work unlimited hours
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
so i i think this is too far and i think
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
as far you know it's very simple but the
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
complexity we have now
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
was put there by the author of this
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
simple amendment
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
and we can't just undo all of that i
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
think we could simplify with uh maybe we
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
have an amendment or two left
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
or we could reconsider
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh a previous uh vote and and make it
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
simple for everyone concerned but this
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
removing the restrictions on night work
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
for youth
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
um would be for 16 and 17 year olds
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
um to representative adjudance points if
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
a youth can't work past eight o'clock i
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
mean heard testimony from the gentleman
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
from aroma joe's they just schedule
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else anyways so if that youth
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
worked on nine o'clock he might be
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled to close that day instead of
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
losing that shift to something that's
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
older and doesn't has the ability to
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
stay longer
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
again to 12 a.m on friday saturday night
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
what if there is a culinary student or
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
electrical student that wants to do a
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
special project they're unable to do
 
01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.030 align:start position:0%
special project they're unable to do
that

01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
if it's an overnight job i mean
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
where do we
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
tell you if they can work and then can't
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
work and are we removing people from the
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
workforce based on arbitrary numbers
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
my two cents thank you
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
all right you're gonna have to listen to
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
my mother grew up in caribou maine
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
and they used to take two weeks off
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
after school started to pick potatoes
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
because her dad was a farmer and that's
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
how you
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
made your money to have money for the
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
school year and new clothes and so i
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
grew up hearing stories about my mom
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
picking potatoes my dad reading meters
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
up in up in canton new york in the
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
freezing cold having to read electric
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
meters and
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully someone would let him in and
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
give him a hot cup of coffee or cocoa or
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
something when he's doing that so
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
obviously things have changed you know
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
when the first 7-eleven opened that's
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
because they were open from 7 a.m to 11
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
p.m some of the people or themselves and
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
you and i remember as kids when things
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
were shut down at five o'clock that's it
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
mom had to go shopping during the week
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
because at five or six o'clock the
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
stores close down
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
so obviously now we have a 24 hour
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
not just united states but global
 
01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.470 align:start position:0%
not just united states but global
economy

01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.310 align:start position:0%
economy
where

01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
kids are put into all different
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
aspects and every single one of you
 
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
makes a great point
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
something where someone has to drive 30
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
miles away or more in the north country
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
versus someone sitting in the lakes
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
region where their
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
july 4th weekend they can you know work
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
as late as they can because they just
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
need more and more employees
 
01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.189 align:start position:0%
need more and more employees
so

01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated situation and we
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
try to
 
01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
try to
make

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.830 align:start position:0%
make
this

01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
work for everybody
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i remember getting into an argument
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago what is was someone
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
with a goal here in the labor committee
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
and they said well it's to take care of
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
employees and someone said no it's not
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
to take care of employers no it's not
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
let's take care of everybody as best we
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
can as even as we can as fairly as we
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
can but everyone's different everyone
 
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
has a different situation
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
we have kids that come to the boys and
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
girls club every morning
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know um in manchester because they
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
haven't eaten
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe we don't understand that but
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
there's certain people that have to work
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
and there's certain people that it's
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
more of a luxury to have to work
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
when they're in high school so we're
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
trying to take all these different
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
things that exist here and put them all
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
into one thing it's very difficult and i
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate everyone's willingness to try
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
but even some of the things we've talked
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
about today
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily going to work
 
01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.950 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily going to work
transportation

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee in the legislature passed a
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
bill a few years ago that said if you're
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
under 18 you can't drive past 11 o'clock
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
so is this going to preclude certain
 
01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.550 align:start position:0%
so is this going to preclude certain
people

01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
from working till 11 o'clock at night
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
their parents have to come pick them up
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
because technically they're not supposed
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
to drive
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
i talked to the department of labor he
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
said what happens if a kid goes to work
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
at 3am
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
because he's got to be at the farm for
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
the farmer at 3 a.m so he can help milk
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
the cows and do everything so he can get
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
to school by 8.
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
no restrictions on that so we're we're
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
trying to worry about a kid going to bed
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
at night
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
and what time they're going to go to bed
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
during a school night or a week night
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
or weekend night it was at eight nine
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
ten o'clock a good night but it's okay
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
if they get up at three o'clock in the
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
morning to go work at the farm
 
01:28:56.719 --> 01:28:58.629 align:start position:0%
morning to go work at the farm
so

01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
honestly this entire concept should have
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
gone to some big study committee and
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
dealt with appropriately
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you for listening to my
 
01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.070 align:start position:0%
so thank you for listening to my
diatribe

01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
diatribe
 
01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.030 align:start position:0%
diatribe
um

01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.149 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's how i try to make my thought
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
process trying to take in all the
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.159 --> 01:29:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
life

01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
try to make the best decision possible
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
trying to remember what it was like when
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
all of us remember when all of you were
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
16 and 17.
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
you worked who worked in the grocery
 
01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:29.990 align:start position:0%
you worked who worked in the grocery
store

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
store
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
i worked in the grand union
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay and so i i
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know i tried to take all those
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
things into play and quite frankly
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
nothing we have here is perfect and
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
i question um this night work
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be applicable
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
because again at 11 o'clock brian you
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
can't be driving in the road the state
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
police this police can stop you because
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
of a youthful driver you can't drive
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
after 11 o'clock
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
so who knows how that's going to affect
 
01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.270 align:start position:0%
so who knows how that's going to affect
this

01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have to figure it out and
 
01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:02.310 align:start position:0%
we'll have to figure it out and
hopefully

01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
if we pass something here and it goes to
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
the senate we can have a committee
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
conference and
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
and and i can uh make make uh
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative attitude cahill and
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
avilani work work hard on that and
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
figure out a solution that's going to
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
make everybody happy but in the interim
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
so that is my that is my point here this
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
nothing's perfect um
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm trying to take into effect that
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
people that do need to work
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
because they need it
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
the their parents don't have the
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
discretionary income for the things they
 
01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:33.030 align:start position:0%
discretionary income for the things they
need

01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
versus those that you know
 
01:30:35.199 --> 01:30:36.950 align:start position:0%
versus those that you know
um

01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's more of a a nicety
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
apologize but that's my uh my comments
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
and well i will support this albeit not
 
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.310 align:start position:0%
and well i will support this albeit not
perfect

01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh rubs of agent
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i did hear you say
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
during uh your commentary um that you
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
wished this had gone to a big study
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee um i would like to point out
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
for the committee that it is entirely
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
possible um that the otp motion could be
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
defeated and that this could be sent to
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
interim study which is something that we
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
did earlier
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
so i agree that this
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
should be looked into more because there
 
01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:14.550 align:start position:0%
should be looked into more because there
are

01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
a considerable number of
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh things to be discussed
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
i suggested in the last couple days
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
punting this to a work session um but
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
we're really pressed up against
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
deadlines so
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem like that was going to
 
01:31:27.679 --> 01:31:28.830 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem like that was going to
happen

01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
um i i would just put that out there
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
that uh we are not tied to the current
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
i will rise in support of this uh
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
i believe the bureaucracy that governs
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
best governs least and i also have a lot
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
of faith in uh
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
parents the underage youth employee
 
01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.950 align:start position:0%
parents the underage youth employee
employee

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
the employee and the employer
 
01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.830 align:start position:0%
the employee and the employer
relationship

01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:32:07.199 --> 01:32:09.510 align:start position:0%
and i think
as

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
this with many other bills
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
the the less we get involved
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
implementing what we as individuals or
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
as group think believe should happen
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
that it's best left to the individuals
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
that are involved in the situation to
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
make that decision so i fully support
 
01:32:30.159 --> 01:32:31.510 align:start position:0%
make that decision so i fully support
this

01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
is that representative bouchard
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you

for taking my
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
testimony here and i just wanted to uh
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
add to representative turcotte's idea of
 
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:52.550 align:start position:0%
add to representative turcotte's idea of
letting

01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
letting
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
parents and
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
industry decide
 
01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.350 align:start position:0%
industry decide
uh

01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
what's best i come from a city
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh manchester that
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
had that type of
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
philosophy with the amiscake mills so
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
that is the reason why i think
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
possibly what we need to do is to go
 
01:33:11.679 --> 01:33:12.550 align:start position:0%
possibly what we need to do is to go
through

01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
interim study thank you
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
references to george orwell 1984 would
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
group think i will ask the clerk to call
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
the role i was out of brutality
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman um
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
we all believe that
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
we all love our children and want to
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
take care of them
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
but there are people out there who don't
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
care that much about their children
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
and don't care how much they work
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
during our caucus i mentioned a family
 
01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.470 align:start position:0%
during our caucus i mentioned a family
where

01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
three underprivileged kids would work
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
their father would take them to work
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
pick them up and collect their paycheck
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
and that guy didn't work at all
 
01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.270 align:start position:0%
and that guy didn't work at all
so

01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
we all don't i mean i think we're all
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
decent people here but the real world is
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
not everybody cares for their kids like
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
we would
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
um basically the only change hopefully
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
motion's been made seconded by
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
representatives sorry
 
01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.310 align:start position:0%
representatives sorry
sullivan

01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
sullivan
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
motion's been made and seconded your
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized to
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
speak anymore thank you um
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
the last two lines on this amendment are
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
really what
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think answers the middle ground
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
between managing too closely and being
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
confusing and throwing the whole law out
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
with a bathwater
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
i think we have to be very careful
 
01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.950 align:start position:0%
i think we have to be very careful
to

01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
set limits for our children i think we
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
have to set limits to protect businesses
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
and our children
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think we have to worry about where
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
they are what they're doing
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
and this is very clear if you have
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
school the following day you may not
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
work past nine o'clock
 
01:36:24.159 --> 01:36:26.070 align:start position:0%
work past nine o'clock
period

01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
on friday and saturday you're free to
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
work until
 
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.350 align:start position:0%
work until
12.

01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
you can work 35 hours a week and that
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
i think working till nine as a
 
01:36:44.639 --> 01:36:45.590 align:start position:0%
i think working till nine as a
youth

01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
youth
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
is an appropriate time even if you have
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
to drive home you're not going to work
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
an hour from home
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
it would be very reasonable hours
 
01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.590 align:start position:0%
it would be very reasonable hours
and

01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
it simplified this we received a letter
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
recently from an employer who said this
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
is so confusing i can't follow it this
 
01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.270 align:start position:0%
is so confusing i can't follow it this
is

01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
convoluted and we know it is this law
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
labor law has been in there and changed
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
year after year after year and for all
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
the years i've been here we have found
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
more crazy things in law that need to be
 
01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.109 align:start position:0%
more crazy things in law that need to be
changed

01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
we we thought perhaps there would be a
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee working on all of labor law
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
then on a portion of it
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
it would be a good idea to overhaul it
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
with the help of the labor department
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
but i think until now this clarifies
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
for employers what they can schedule
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
and helps protect our kids from working
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
too many hours
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative proud
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
some only questions i have reading the
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
news section we're talking about for
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
night work in this amendment is it
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem clear what the restriction
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
is or if there's any at all on
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
for a sunday night when monday's a
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
holiday it looks like that night would
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
be unrestricted
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
youth employee could work as late as
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
they wanted i think this is this is
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
entirely clear if you have school the
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
following day then you can't work past
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
nine that would take care of monday
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
holidays it would even for wednesday
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
when the teachers are off and school is
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
yes when the available day was a holiday
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
so they could work to past midnight till
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
1am 3 am
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
anytime at all
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
in when there's a monday holiday on any
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
school day
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm pausing because i'm thinking because
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
i think i i see the disconnect here
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps the last line instead of the
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
last three words instead of on friday or
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
saturday it should say other days
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think would make it a lot more clear
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
to address the issue i'm trying to get
 
01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:29.189 align:start position:0%
to address the issue i'm trying to get
at

01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:36.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
yeah

01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else represent sullivan and then
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
followed by cahill
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
i i agree that there is a little glitch
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
there um i would however say this is uh
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
probably um it's not as simple as um
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth's um but it does
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
provide some sort of guidance as to
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
how late a
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
student can
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
can work
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i think having
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
no limitation on any day
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
is as i said a step too far this does uh
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
provide some guidance um
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if there's a way that we
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
could agree to amend the amendment
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
um and and then continue to vote with
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
without it having a official number
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
but um or we could
 
01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.750 align:start position:0%
but um or we could
but

01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think the the improvement that uh
 
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.430 align:start position:0%
i think the the improvement that uh
representative

01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.310 align:start position:0%
representative
schmidt

01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
suggested would would be great
 
01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:33.910 align:start position:0%
suggested would would be great
but

01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
i would say this is probably the
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
clearest one we've got so far that
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
provides some guidance i will support it
 
01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.510 align:start position:0%
provides some guidance i will support it
representative

01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i think that
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
this would be the preferred amendment uh
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
for this bill if in fact we could either
 
01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:52.950 align:start position:0%
for this bill if in fact we could either
uh

01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
suspend and and worked on the other bill
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
while the
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
amendment was
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh pursued with lls maybe we could get
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
it done today or we could have a floor
 
01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
it done today or we could have a floor
amendment

01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
to correct that small piece at the end
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
so that we would have the protections
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
for our youth and the clarity that is
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just a question on
 
01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:23.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just a question on
um

01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
line four and five um i understand the
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
designated work week but could you
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
define what julie enrolled in school
 
01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
define what julie enrolled in school
means

01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why you think it's unclear
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
um if someone has left school at 17
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
because they no longer want to be in
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
school then they wouldn't fall under
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.669 align:start position:0%
 
clarification

01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um so a homeschooler is not
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
duly enrolled in school
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
or a charter school is not julie
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
enrolled in school charter is so it's
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
school year for the district school year
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
well charter schools are duly enrolled
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
students i'm not exactly sure how home
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
school students
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
isn't the dually enrolled in school
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
current law yes it is
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
well then you look at rules all right so
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
are you uh
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
finished with your inquiry or your
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
question representative about it or
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
would you like to follow up or or
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're all set
 
01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.189 align:start position:0%
you're all set
um

01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
an issue i hadn't really considered much
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
until rep beloved brought it up on a on
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
one of the other previous bills is the
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
home schools
 
01:43:07.119 --> 01:43:08.310 align:start position:0%
home schools
so

01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
we were told that the homeschoolers this
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
would apply to the district with chin
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
within within that that student is
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
located is the way i understood it
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
so let's just say the home and i'm not
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure how the
 
01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:31.430 align:start position:0%
sure how the
homeschoolers

01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily structure their their
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
schedules or their week but let's just
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
say that the homeschooler
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
their school week consisted of
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
friday saturday sunday and monday work
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
where they were off during the middle of
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
the week
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
this would preclude those homeschoolers
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
then from working at night because their
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
regulations are based upon
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
night work contained in this rsa
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
i believe that homeschoolers
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
their schedule is the same as the
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
location that they are they are in
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that's correct uh this
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
the home school this law would apply to
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
a home school person as
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh as as their school district
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
operates but if a homeschooling parent
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
has a homeschooling schedule of friday
 
01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.830 align:start position:0%
has a homeschooling schedule of friday
through

01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
monday say a four day
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
homeschooling week and their off days
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
are tuesday wednesday and thursday this
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
law here
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
would prevent that those school children
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
from working tuesday wednesday or
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
if if i may
 
01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.070 align:start position:0%
if if i may
the

01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
that is correct but that is the current
 
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.430 align:start position:0%
that is correct but that is the current
law

01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
and because it is way too complicated to
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
find out you know how many people are
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and what their schedules
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
might be if you if you'd like to make it
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
difficult for employers
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative army
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like to point out i
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
believe that we still have laws against
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
leaving children alone during the day
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
under a certain age and that a
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
homeschooler would have to be figuring
 
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
out what he was going to do with those
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
there was another c
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman there were a
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
couple of references to the current law
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
that i i wanted to make clear because
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
not everybody does understand what the
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
current law means
 
01:45:59.590 --> 01:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
um it applies to 16 and 17 year olds so
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think leaving them them at home
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
is a legal issue
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
um it also does not res the current law
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
does not restrict homeschoolers from
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
working on a tuesday night
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
past eight past nine
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
past 11 if that's what
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
works for their situation
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
so the contrast is not with current law
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
which and i'll say it again to be clear
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
it does not restrict hours it restricts
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
the contrast is with these counter
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
proposals that have come up
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
as a substitute for night work which
 
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:43.430 align:start position:0%
as a substitute for night work which
would

01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
offer to restrict
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
either during the school year or the
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
current law applies only all year round
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
the current night work law has nothing
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
to do whether school's in session or not
 
01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
to do whether school's in session or not
it's

01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:57.270 align:start position:0%
it's
it's

01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
purely based on age
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
and it's purely a restriction on
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
working more than eight hours in a day
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
if you have worked certain hours
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
at least three days during the week
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
was it a problem
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'll reiterate a point which i brought
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
up as a question to the senator
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill at the public
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
hearing which was um
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
most of the replacements uh for the
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
night work session has said you can't
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
work past a certain time and
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
chairman you allude to this and
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
your comments as well they don't
 
01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.870 align:start position:0%
your comments as well they don't
restrict

01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
when you can begin working
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
so you know if the restriction is you
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
can't work later than 9 pm
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
if a shift starts at 9 30 pm and goes
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
all the way through the night it would
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
appear to be in compliance and that just
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense it doesn't
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
say you know
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
not later than 9 pm and not before dawn
 
01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
or or any or not later than midnight not
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
before dawn it just
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
all these um replacements just seem to
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
be absent the other half of the equation
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.629 align:start position:0%
if the
to

01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:17.109 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
are you talking about 16 and 17 year
 
01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.990 align:start position:0%
are you talking about 16 and 17 year
olds

01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes that's what where this section would
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
apply to okay um well there are limits
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
to um when they can drive from what i
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
understand they can't drive after 11
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
o'clock was that that's my understanding
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the law so i think
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think what we can do obviously is make
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
certain assumptions that
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
if we make a law that takes every single
 
01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:45.830 align:start position:0%
if we make a law that takes every single
possibility

01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.030 align:start position:0%
possibility
into

01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.550 align:start position:0%
into
account

01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
that this would be huge and it would be
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
more confusing than anybody could ever
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
i i still need to
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
i need to answer that businessman who
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
says i need a simple law to follow
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
aside from throwing out all of the law i
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
think this clarifies it and makes it
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
easier for people to to perform
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
working past night at night it's implied
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
that you're not going to work at 10 or
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're not going to work at two
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
starting hours
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that matters as long as
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
you adhere to the 35 hours a week and no
 
01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.790 align:start position:0%
you adhere to the 35 hours a week and no
more

01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
so i think that answers your question
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you yes it does but one follow-up
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
yes one additional comment um i think we
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
focused a lot on the aspect of driving
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
hours uh and at least my high school job
 
01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.030 align:start position:0%
hours uh and at least my high school job
was

01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:46.709 align:start position:0%
was
i'm

01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
software development and coding
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
something that perfectly would have been
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
possible in today's age to do from home
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
completely with no driving and i think
 
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
all these proposals would equally apply
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
if it was an in-person job where you had
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
to report to a business
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
or if you were a work-from-home job as a
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
16 or 17 year old as well
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
where all the driving issues would not
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative smith i do like the way
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
you've tried to toward these things it
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
was some of the comments and and
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
um about how to alter some of these
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
things and some of those guys with
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
orange badges in the back
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh maybe you can and work on some kind
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
of a floor amendment because
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not a big fan of
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
no restrictions whatsoever um
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
as well for the points that
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
we all know to be true and what
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative baruti said about
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
may have different
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
since we're changing this parental this
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
needs to go back to the senate is that
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:04.870 align:start position:0%
if we
pass

01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:09.669 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
so it does have to go back to
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
they can they can concur
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
they can not concur and request a
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
committee conference which i'd like to
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
see committee of conference for this
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
all right any additional questions

01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak to motion
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't want to
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
belabor the point we've certainly
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
discussed um in detail the issues with
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
this this bill
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
as i said when i was talking
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
about some of the amendments i think
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
this came to us from the senate with a
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
clear purpose
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
to simplify three areas of law where
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
employers are feeling
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
tied down by the complexity
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
as amended i am comfortable it does just
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i had a feeling
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
the amendments were going to go the way
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
they did today so to follow your lead i
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
prepared my own soliloquy
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
if you've gone into any of your local
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants shops on your main streets
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
or you've listened to your voicemails
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know that we have a really severe
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage in the state
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
when was that said
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
that was the prime sponsor of this bill
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
in senate commerce in january of 2022
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
that sentence word for word devoid of
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
any further context could have been and
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
was said over and over and over
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
from march 2020 to august 2021
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
for the first time in my lifetime the
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
federal government had stepped in to
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
support and enhance the material
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
conditions of people's lives in the face
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
of a crisis by introducing enhanced
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits almost immediately
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
forces in mainstream media swore up and
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
down that the 600 and then 300 benefits
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
were the sole thing the single thing
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
stopping our competitive labor market
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
from bouncing back and if only president
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
biden would stop paying people to stay
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
home we could once again go to our
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
favorite restaurants where a server in a
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
mask and a shield who has no sick pay
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
could take our orders
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
envy was used to pit lower income
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
americans against lower income americans
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
and it worked
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
in august of 2021 president biden ended
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
enhanced unemployment benefits and the
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
following jobs report was a wet plastic
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
bag business interest had convinced the
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
federal government to end the single
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
most impactful piece of support for
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
american workers since the new deal and
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
it flopped
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
turns out there was a correlation and
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
some may say causation that the reason
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
why nobody wanted to be a server who was
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
only guaranteed 327 an hour was because
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
they were a server who would only be
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
guaranteed 327 an hour
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
the reactionary method of ending
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment didn't fix the problem
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
were we then to consider a minimum wage
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
increase to make the low-paying jobs
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
more attractive to applicants what about
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
paid time off what about streamlining
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
the formation of strong labor unions to
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
bargain for rights or literally anything
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
else that has historically proven to
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
support the economic needs of the common
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
everyday person
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
nope of course not instead we're here
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
considering a bill to expand the amount
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
of hours that the time and the time that
 
01:55:53.669 --> 01:55:53.679 align:start position:0%
children can work as a means of trying
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
to plug the shortage of people willing
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
to work for wages that nobody can
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
possibly live on you can tell me all you
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
want oh josh these aren't kids they're
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
16 and 17. they can't vote they can't
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
drink they can't smoke they can't enlist
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
they can't get a credit card and they
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
can't drop out of school in the eyes of
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
god in the state of new hampshire they
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
are children and most importantly they
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
are children who have homework to do
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
that they will not be able to accomplish
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
if they're working until 10 pm or beyond
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
10 pm now as the bill allows whenever
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
it sacrifices a student educational
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
attainment allegedly the great american
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
equalizer so that people don't have to
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
wait in line as shaw's it wait in line
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
at shaw's as long and i think that is
 
01:56:34.639 --> 01:56:35.510 align:start position:0%
at shaw's as long and i think that is
wrong

01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
but josh this just allows kids to work
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
until whenever they want to it doesn't
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
require them to they can just ask their
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
manager not to schedule them
 
01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
we were all here when deputy
 
01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner ogden told this committee
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i quote
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's a large part of the dialogue in
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
these conversations you'd think you'd
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
say to that parent well then don't let
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
them work but the parents will often say
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
to us well if i tell my kid that they
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
can't work that late the employer will
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
just replace them with someone who can
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
parents see it that if they set the
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
barriers the kids may lose their job
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
well josh some families need more money
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
than others so their kids will have to
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
work nearly full time i agree that there
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
are poorer families than others that's
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
why i support bringing back the child
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
tax credit that's slash childhood
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
poverty in america that's why i support
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
bolstering ebt and cash assistance or
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an
 
01:57:23.599 --> 01:57:24.390 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an
hour

01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
i agreed that the nightwork rule
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
currently in statute is confusing if we
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
want to clean that up and set good
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions i support that that can be
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
done while keeping a cap at 9pm so our
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
kids can do their homework and get to
 
01:57:35.679 --> 01:57:36.470 align:start position:0%
kids can do their homework and get to
bed

01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
bed
 
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
if you want younger servers to clear
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
cups fine i'd support that that can be
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
done with just set it without setting
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
non-existent hour caps and just punting
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the bill except for the
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
first section
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
but when those two things are ruled out
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
as justifications it only leaves what
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
every single person who testified on
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
this bill said well we have a labor
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
shortage and so we're going to abdicate
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to sweeten the
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
unfilled jobs and instead just let the
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
kids do it
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
i heard that no fewer than three times
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing that's what i
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
think the real drive behind this bill is
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's why i'll be voting against it
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
today and i hope that you will join me
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
in that so we can feed this motion and
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
send it to an interim study where it
 
01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:27.589 align:start position:0%
send it to an interim study where it
belongs

01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
would anyone else
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
well i don't agree with everything you
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
said i respect your right to say it
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
i could
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
give a rat's butt about a labor shortage
 
01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:50.070 align:start position:0%
give a rat's butt about a labor shortage
uh

01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
what i do care about is trying to make
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
something less confusing
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
while trying to figure out a way
 
01:58:55.599 --> 01:58:56.950 align:start position:0%
while trying to figure out a way
that

01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
without being
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
the government parent
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:13.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
protection i guess from for their
 
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
parents and those who don't i guess
 
01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:18.790 align:start position:0%
parents and those who don't i guess
but

01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:19.589 align:start position:0%
but
don't

01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
throw in my face
 
01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.510 align:start position:0%
throw in my face
that

01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
get kids to work more hours a lower
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
paying jobs and i'm trying to help
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
a labor shortage i don't think that's
 
01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:40.070 align:start position:0%
a labor shortage i don't think that's
ingenuous

01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no other comments
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not not a big fan of floor
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendments um
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
but i think in this case uh
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
one is uh
 
01:59:54.239 --> 01:59:55.430 align:start position:0%
one is uh
appropriate

01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
and i will uh support amending
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt's uh amendment
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
to make it clear
 
02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:04.950 align:start position:0%
to make it clear
and

02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
i would reiterate again that i think
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
having no limits on night work for
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 year olds is is definitely a
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
step too far
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
and so i think uh bringing a floor
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that is a little bit clearer
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
um a little bit more complete
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
um and that provides a reasonable limit
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate and
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
i will simply um forewarn you that
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's likely to happen and i'm hoping
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
that we can find enough votes of people
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
who don't want to see kids working until
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
midnight on school nights
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
i think maybe there might be enough
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
folks that will vote in favor of
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
something less than that thank you
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%

while i was not here at the hearing last

week i did go back and review the um the
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
tapes on it
 
02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.310 align:start position:0%

emails and in-person uh
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
discussions on the changes that had come
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
out from the original sb 209
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh the one that we came to us as amended
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
by uh senate and there were
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
lots of issues with
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
lines of the the new paragraph large uh
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph added in 14 lines 14 through
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
21 and as i started to
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
read through that i i too saw that
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
that there were uh
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
more burdens being placed on the
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
businesses more regulations more
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
penalties more
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
everything and
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
the one that really caught my attention
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
immediately was
 
02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.669 align:start position:0%
immediately was
um

02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
should an employee payroll payroll
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
employees payroll card be lost i'll
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
leave out the rest of it the employer
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
shall provide the employee with a
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
replacement payroll card within 25
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
four hours of being notified
 
02:03:17.599 --> 02:03:18.470 align:start position:0%
four hours of being notified
and

02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
immediately i thought to
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
again like not that i've ever done this
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
but on a friday night
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
going out and
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
leaving a credit card somewhere or
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
misplacing a
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
credit card or doing something
 
02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
why would it be on the employer
 
02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:37.350 align:start position:0%
why would it be on the employer
to

02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
open up his business on a weekend
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
to go in and make good with a
 
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
replacement payroll card for
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
the employer employee who had lost that
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
card again just one example
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
as i dug deeper and deeper into this and
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
i went further and further down the
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole it once again came to me the
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
the saying of the bureaucracy that
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
governs best governs least
 
02:04:03.679 --> 02:04:06.950 align:start position:0%
governs best governs least
and

02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
i just pulled out the entire
 
02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.470 align:start position:0%
i just pulled out the entire
act

02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
rsa 275 i was just amazed at how
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
much we tend to try to
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
dig down and solve every little issue
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
here every little issue there and let
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
instead of letting the employer and the
 
02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:25.510 align:start position:0%
instead of letting the employer and the
employee

02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know figure out their arrangements
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
having said all that i i went back and
 
02:04:30.239 --> 02:04:31.750 align:start position:0%
having said all that i i went back and
simply

02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
simply
reintroduced

02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
reintroduced
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is nothing more than
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
the original bill sb 209
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh so i would ask that you support that
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd like to
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
paint a picture of the type of employee
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
this is an employee who probably does
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
not have a bank account or
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
many of the people who take these cards
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
will not have a bank account
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
they will likely be living from
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
day to day dollar to dollar
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
with no extra
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
spending money whatsoever
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
if they are getting their payroll
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
sent to this payroll card
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
the only money they may have would be
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
the payroll card
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
if they
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
if the card is damaged or stops working
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i know that you know my debit cards
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
take a beating and
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
often i suddenly find that i've got a
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
debit card that doesn't work anymore
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
i can at least go to the bank and do a
 
02:05:37.679 --> 02:05:39.189 align:start position:0%
i can at least go to the bank and do a
withdrawal

02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
withdrawal
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
but this person doesn't have an account
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
all their money is tied up on that card
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
they've got no other money
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
the card is is no longer working they
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
have no money
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
they can't buy gas they can't buy food
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
they can't pay the rent if it's due
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
they have no money
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
they they need to be able to get their
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
money access to the money within 24
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
hours we heard testimony that employers
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
are given blank cards that can quickly
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
run through a machine and uh and set up
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
so that that employee can again gain
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
access to the only place they have any
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
money which is on that card
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
um so i would point out that um
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
getting access quickly is going to be
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
important um without that 24-hour limit
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
the employer has no obligation to
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
provide a replacement card at all
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
unless and then perhaps that employee
 
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
would have to file a complaint with the
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
labor department and then wait for a
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
hearing to find out um how they're going
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
to get access to their money i think
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
that clause was put in there for a good
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i think the uh
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
the language that was added by the
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
senate is similar to that where uh
 
02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
where uh direct deposit or a paycheck
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh is lost or you know doesn't work and
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
the the employee is entitled to their
 
02:07:21.119 --> 02:07:21.990 align:start position:0%
the the employee is entitled to their
money

02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.030 align:start position:0%
money
timely

02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
timely
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
and there can be fines for not providing
 
02:07:28.229 --> 02:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
that money in a timely fashion
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we want to exempt
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
governor seaworth
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and and thank you
 
02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:40.709 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and and thank you
representative

02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
i was trying to think of of how to say
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
that and you you described it very well
 
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
um the essence of this bill
 
02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.910 align:start position:0%
um the essence of this bill
is

02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
not the addition of pay pay cards which
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
is already in current law
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
but the removal of the requirement to
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
pay by check
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is doing and i i
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
believe the representative is correct
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
an employee loses their check
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
between leaving the workplace
 
02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:20.470 align:start position:0%
between leaving the workplace
and

02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
getting getting to the place where they
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
can cash it or there's some technical
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
problem where they show up with the
 
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
check and it can't be cashed
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
these issues do apply and these issues
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
are in existing law
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
and whether we could probably
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
quiz the director the deputy director if
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
he were here before us exactly how they
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
might deal with that situation
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
if it were a check but i i believe that
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
you're correct that it's not that
 
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:53.510 align:start position:0%
you're correct that it's not that
um

02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
the employer doesn't have to pay anybody
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
anymore i i think the existing labor law
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
does have a way of doing it yes the
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
amendment from the senate
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
which is the original bill that we
 
02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:11.030 align:start position:0%
which is the original bill that we
considered

02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
considered
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
has a lot of details specific to payroll
 
02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:15.510 align:start position:0%
has a lot of details specific to payroll
cards

02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
cards
 
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean by removing all
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
those specifics we exempt payroll cards
 
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
from the regulations that apply to all
 
02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
the other forms of pay
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
that are currently allowed by law and
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
would continue to be allowed by law
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative avilani
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
the 24 hours is basically
 
02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:49.750 align:start position:0%
the 24 hours is basically
um

02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
if an employee is paid on friday they
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
call their employer on saturday six
 
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock hey i lost my card i can't have
 
02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
access to my
 
02:09:57.679 --> 02:09:58.629 align:start position:0%
access to my
funds

02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
they can certainly issue a card within
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
24 hours however it's not going to be
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
linked to their account until monday
 
02:10:03.679 --> 02:10:05.109 align:start position:0%
linked to their account until monday
morning

02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
just because you have blank payroll
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
cards does not mean you can go and
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
automatically link them to a
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse account
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
like adp or paychecks or something like
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
that you don't have that ability you can
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
issue a card with their name on it and
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
give them a number and then in turn that
 
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
number is linked to their account within
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
adp by their
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
employee id number
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
the 24 hours having the employer on that
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
hook for that 24 hours is unworkable if
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
with the payroll card
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
they can certainly issue a check but
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
this is saying they need to replace
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
that payroll account within 24 hours of
 
02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
being notified
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wish peg cards would go away
 
02:10:57.840 --> 02:10:59.350 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wish peg cards would go away
um

02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh i think they did
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion is they feed
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
people too much
 
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm happy to see that this is new
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
technology coming on unfortunately
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
you'll have to have a smartphone but new
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
technology where you don't need a card
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
as everything's done there and you can
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
tap things and there's no fee and
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
everything else i think these pay cards
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
should go away
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
um the only thing i do like about what
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
we've done here is
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
you can still ask for a check
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
i don't want to keep talking guys but
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
i've two things i really believe
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
strongly in all my years here number one
 
02:11:37.830 --> 02:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
tips are 100
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
owned by the employees that's what you
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
get taught in the labor committee that's
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
what stays a committee number two you
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
are an employee unless you can prove
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise and number three
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
should be it's your money
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
i earned it
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
make it easy for me to get it
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm old-fashioned and
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
give me a check so i can go cash it
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
um try to use a credit union where
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's limited fees and i'd love to get
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
rid of these things
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
but that's not what's in front of us
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%

checks and direct deposit we have
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who requested a green dot
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%

no further concerns from them our
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
experience with green dot prepaid card
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
is this my son works here he's president
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
our payroll department got an email
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
supposedly from him asking that his
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
direct deposit be moved to green dot by
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
the time we realized it had been several
 
02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
they've done several weeks pay have been
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
transferred we work with our bank td but
 
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
none of the money could be recovered no
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
tracking we were told that the type of
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
that type of scam is generally from
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
overseas the money goes out of the
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
country and is not recoverable so we
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
refuse to use prepaid debit cards for
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
payroll direct deposit to an established
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
bank or paper check
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
that's good i hope this helps please
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
feel free to reach out for any questions
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%

02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
that there's these scams out there i
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
worried about you know being hacked and
 
02:13:59.350 --> 02:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know every institution is vulnerable
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
to hacking whereas you get the check in
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
your hand like you said mr chairman you
 
02:14:12.630 --> 02:14:12.640 align:start position:0%

02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
revenue source for some of these payroll
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
companies which is dastardly

cards

02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
cards
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh i think this is an issue for the
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
payroll card people
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh the revenue that they'll see from
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
this and the use of more plastic
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
and perhaps even the people who have
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
collection agencies will benefit one day
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
from all this but there is no need in
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
the business community for this
 
02:17:51.679 --> 02:17:52.790 align:start position:0%
the business community for this
provision

02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
i remember the attitude followed by
 
02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:02.709 align:start position:0%
i remember the attitude followed by
sullivan

02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
sullivan
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would simply say
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
that i agreed with the points that you
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
made um
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
regarding uh wishing payroll cards would
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
go away
 
02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
um and the concern
 
02:18:14.479 --> 02:18:15.349 align:start position:0%
um and the concern
um

02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
with folks ability to get the money that
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
they earned and as a consequence of that
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
i think um testimony indicated and i
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
think uh just our general knowledge
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
indicates that uh the vast majority of
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
people have moved to direct deposit and
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
um and that works for me it works for
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
most everyone um there's a few dinosaurs
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
out there who like checks better than
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
direct deposits um and this uh
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be offended if people who
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
have bank accounts um
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
were required to go from a paper check
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
to a direct deposit
 
02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:56.070 align:start position:0%
to a direct deposit
what

02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
does offend me though is people who
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
don't have bank accounts being forced to
 
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
have their payroll
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
put on a card
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
um they should have continued to have
 
02:19:07.509 --> 02:19:07.519 align:start position:0%
the option and the cards
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know can exist if somebody really
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
wants to do it that way
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't stand in their way
 
02:19:13.599 --> 02:19:14.389 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't stand in their way
but

02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
people who don't have bank accounts
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to get a paper check
 
02:19:23.349 --> 02:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
and an opportunity to cash it
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
in at a convenient location as the law
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
currently indicates um
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
it's only a few people
 
02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
um they um
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
it i don't think it's a great deal
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty for an employer to issue a
 
02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
few paper checks
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
and it'd be far better than putting
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
their money on a card that's going to
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
get hit with
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of fees as has been described so i
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify something you
 
02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:05.270 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify something you
said

02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
we're whispering something and that's
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
rude so i'll say it out loud for
 
02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:12.710 align:start position:0%
rude so i'll say it out loud for
everybody

02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:15.349 align:start position:0%
everybody
um

02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
to distill this multi-page bill down to
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
a single sentence
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of this bill
 
02:20:28.830 --> 02:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
is the removal of
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
the option that the employee can insist
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
on a paper check
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the employer wants
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
that leaves and and this applies both to
 
02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
the version that came to us from the
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
senate as well as the version that we've
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
just amended they're both identical in
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
that regard they strike the sentence
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
that allows the employee to override the
 
02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:56.389 align:start position:0%
that allows the employee to override the
employer

02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
when there's an issue with how to be
 
02:20:58.240 --> 02:20:59.190 align:start position:0%
when there's an issue with how to be
paid

02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
paid
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
current law the employee can say you
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
know what i don't like any of your
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
options i want to check
 
02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:06.150 align:start position:0%
options i want to check
um

02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.319 --> 02:21:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
i don't like i don't like the lesser of
 
02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:41.030 align:start position:0%
i don't like i don't like the lesser of
evils

02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
evils
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
i don't like what the senate did to us
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
this year
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
mr clerk you can call the roll
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
emotion on the floor is about to pass
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment i'm sorry representative
 
02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:57.270 align:start position:0%
the amendment i'm sorry representative
avilani

02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
avilani
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
would we as a committee be able to
 
02:22:01.359 --> 02:22:03.270 align:start position:0%
would we as a committee be able to
remove

02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
remove
 
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
payroll cards next session
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
if we just took out section d
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
would we be able to do that
 
02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you'd have a number of payroll
 
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
card people coming in here crying foul
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
but you could try to do anything you'd
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
like i think it'd be nice to have them
 
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
i think we need to do whatever we can
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
to make someone that worked for a pay
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
get their pay
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
is easy as possible with as few fees as
 
02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:35.030 align:start position:0%
is easy as possible with as few fees as
possible

02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
and time to come up with a compromise
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
between what is good for the employer
 
02:22:40.469 --> 02:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
and the employee but you know what it's
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
the employee's money
 
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
not agree more mr chairman
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'll just say if you took out deed
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
and if you took that out and
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth's point stands
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
that the underlying
 
02:22:56.399 --> 02:22:58.309 align:start position:0%
that the underlying
um

02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
outcome of the legislation
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
the employee no longer has the ability
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
to request a check
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
and they don't have direct deposit
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:27.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:29.429 --> 02:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
no that's why i was whispering to my
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's not a fail
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
i i think the most direct path to what
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
we want is to just vote no on the on the
 
02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.030 align:start position:0%
we want is to just vote no on the on the
bill

02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
and leave the law as it is today
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
now there's nothing there's nothing to
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
prevent an employer from encouraging
 
02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh an employee you know you know here's
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
these here's a list of credit unions and
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
you could join one of those it's five
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
dollar minimum balance and you can have
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
it you can have a debit card from them
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to i have no responsibility
 
02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
about the fees for the that they may
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
have with the debit card but if you go
 
02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
to a credit union and avoid those
 
02:24:12.469 --> 02:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
dreadful minimum balances at the regular
 
02:24:12.479 --> 02:24:13.750 align:start position:0%
dreadful minimum balances at the regular
banks
