00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
notes so to start the meeting I just
 
00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to sort of review our Charter as
 
00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:11.230 align:start position:0%
wanted to sort of review our Charter as
a

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um last session a
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of discussion and uh
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
review of of several different bills
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
associated with the rules around citing
 
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.990 align:start position:0%
associated with the rules around citing
waste

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
waste
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
facilities and one of the determinations
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
out of the environmental agriculture
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee was that we would form a
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to monitor the progress of
 
00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
that rule making uh activity and so this
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
is the first
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
meeting that uh We've held on this and I
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
just uh the first question I've got
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
really for the committee is I believe we
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
should have followup meetings
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
periodically is that does that make
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
sense to everyone I think so and what uh
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
how often do you think would would make
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
sense just as a start point we can
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
adjust as we go but
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
just monthly
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
bonly you know I really I if it's if
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's okay I'd like to sort of get a
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
sense of the overall scope of what we're
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
looking at here today when we talk with
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
members from Dees and maybe can we come
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
to that conclusion would you be open to
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
coming to that conclusion yeah as we go
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fine I just just trying to
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
set the parameters up front of what
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
we're what we're talking about so uh I
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
think to start off with if we could have
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry ma'am it
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
it's Sarah would you um start off and
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
and Leah Sarah and Leah um if you guys
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
could start off with
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
a a review of what you've been working
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
on I know you've been working on it
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
since the spring absolutely and uh uh it
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if you could give us a
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
a rundown we'd be happy to I'm Sarah uas
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
Kern or you can call me Sarah Kern and
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm the assistant director of the waste
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
management division at Dees this is Leah
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
McKenna Leah is the administrator of the
 
00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
solid waste management
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
Bureau director whims asked me to extend
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
his apologies that he was not able to
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
make it today but Leah and I are glad to
 
00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
be here to talk with
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
you I thought it was help to begin with
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
providing a brief recap of the path that
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
we took to get where we are right now
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
having just last week sent out a draft
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
of proposed amendments to EnV sw800 for
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
informal public
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
input uh recognizing the the complexity
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
of the enw 800 rules which pertain to
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
landfill permitting and landfill
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
sighting and recognizing the interest in
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
them ahead of the formal rulem process
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
we held uh an informal listening session
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
last March to hear input from the public
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
about potential amendments to the
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
section of the solid waste roles uh
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
because there were several bills in the
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
legislature pertaining to landfill
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
sighting at that time we did not include
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
landfill sighting in that March public
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
input session uh but then after after we
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
saw um that the bills did not pass we
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
held a listening session in July to
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
focus on the sighting section of the
 
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.269 align:start position:0%
focus on the sighting section of the
landfill

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
rules we reviewed the comments that we
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
received uh in those March and July
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
sessions and we incorporated what as
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
much as we could uh into a proposal to
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
amend the landfill permitting rules envs
 
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.069 align:start position:0%
amend the landfill permitting rules envs
800

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
800
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
um still recognizing a lot of concern
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
about this set of rules what we did was
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
we released last week the draft proposal
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
of the rules for public comment informal
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
public comment before we begin the
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
formal rul making process which is laid
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
out in the administrative procedures act
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
so those rules were sent out uh last
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
week and the public input
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
um uh phase ends on November 7th at that
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
time we will uh review all the ments we
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
received make changes to the rules as
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate and file our initial
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
Proposal with
 
00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
OS then we
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate uh having a public hearing on
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
the rules as part of the formal Ru
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
making process in the early
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
Springtime and filing the final Proposal
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
with OSS in May that would be in advance
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
of the expiration date for the rules at
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
the end of June of
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
2024 I know this group received the
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
draft proposal but we thought it would
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
be helpful for Leah to provide the
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
highlights of that proposal so
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
Leah good morning again for the record
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
Leah McKenna and I am the administrator
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
of the Sol Waste Management Bureau at
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
Dees so we thought for purposes of
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
discussion we might want to um bring
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
your attention to about a dozen kind of
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
run through um Soup To Nuts in 800 some
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the highlight of uh of some of the
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
proposed changes that we wanted to make
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
and then of course entertain any
 
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
questions you might have and we'll we'll
 
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
do our very best to answer or if not be
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
able to get to An Answer um in short
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
order okay so within 800 uh what you're
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
going to see are sections that deal with
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
sighting requirements for landfills
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
design requirements operating
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
requirements and closure requirements
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
all surrounding
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
landfills let's start with 804 which are
 
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
sighting requirements So within the
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
sighting requirements we have uh
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
protection standards for groundwater and
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
surface water there are setback
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
requirements and there are other General
 
00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:11.829 align:start position:0%
requirements and there are other General
sighting

00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
842b we are proposing adding storm water
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
and decomposition gas infrastructure to
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
the requirements that landfills and
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
infrastructure be located only in areas
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
where groundwater monitoring remediation
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
can be conducted prior to a release
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
having an impact on Water
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
Supplies further we have added that this
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring and Remediation can be
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
conducted prior to having an impact on
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality at the property
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
line This increases groundwater
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
protections by ensuring all
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is included in sighting
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
considerations and requires that
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality not be impacted as
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
it migrates off site which increases the
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
protection of water resources on AB
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
buding proper properties uh overall this
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
provision will ensure that there is
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to get in front of a
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
potential contamination issue before it
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
negatively impacts groundwater quality
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
at a property line or has a negative
 
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
body moving on to the section for
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
surface water protection standards we
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring to your attention 80403
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
C so this contains a new requirement
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
that a landfill be located in such a
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
manner that failures of the waste contam
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
the waste containment system or
 
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure can be detected assessed
 
00:17:36.909 --> 00:17:36.919 align:start position:0%
and a remediation initiated prior to
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
contamination reaching any perennial
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
water body so same as before the intent
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
of this is to ensure that there is
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to get in in front of a
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
potential contamination issue for it
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
body 8040
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
3D that 200 foot setback we currently
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
have Dees is looking to revise that
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
setback to 500 feet um sure questions
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
will come so we'll try to I'm going to
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
try to answer it ahead of time what
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
we've what we've done in order to reach
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
that number for that one part of of uh
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
setback and sighting is we've reviewed
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh what many of the states in the region
 
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
have in their existing rules and what we
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
found that is 500 feet is actually more
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
protective than the regulatory practices
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast and we can share those
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
numbers with you for what other um what
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
other states have have uh after we
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
finish if you'd
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
like so again what this rule would say
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
now is the footprint of a landfill shall
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
not be located within 500 ft of any
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
perennial surface water body measured
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
from the closest Bank of a stream and
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
closest shore of a lake as applicable so
 
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
feet also in that section is 80403
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
G what we're looking to do is revise the
 
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
100-year flood Hazard Zone to to the
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
500-year flood plane to ensure
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
protection against severe floods across
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
time what we also found is that we
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
currently don't have a definition of
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hazard Zone in our rules so let's use
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
flood plane which is actually a defined
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
regulations onto setback requirements
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
and that's an 80404 a we're proposing
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the setback of a landfill
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
footprint to a property line and
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
requiring a minimum vegetated buffer
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
this is going to ensure adequate space
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
in the setback for landfill operations
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
while also ensuring a vegetation buffer
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
to screen visuals and assist in
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
mitigating noise and litter from
 
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.029 align:start position:0%
mitigating noise and litter from
traveling

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
traveling
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
offsite can you just pardon me is that
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
sure we're at we're proposing to add a
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
new requirement under 80404
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
C so right now there're already exist
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
the 500 foot uh vegetative buffer
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
between the footprint of a landfill in
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
residences what this would do is add the
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
same requirement for a vegetated buffer
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
between the landfill footprint and
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
Residential Care Facilities nursing
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
homes and prisons Beyond just residences
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
to provide a vegetated buffer between
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
the lyfi footprint and places where
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
people reside for an extended period of
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
residents 80404 D we're looking to add a
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
requirement that landfills be set back
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
1,000 ft of which 500 ft nearest the
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
property line are vegetated between the
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
landfill and places where vulnerable
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
populations like dayc carees and
 
00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals are regularly present on a
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
daily or a near- daily basis so that
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
reads there shall be a minimum of 1,000
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
foot setback of which the 500 feet
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
nearest the property line shall be
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
vegetated for properties containing
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
Public Schools licensed daycare
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.950 align:start position:0%
facilities and
hospitals

00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
now I'd like to move on to section 805
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
within the chapter 800 and that's design
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
requirements pardon sure uh I just wanna
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
because we're going through a lot um did
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
you say that that also included schools
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
schol so design requirements they
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
outline requirements for the design of
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
landfill liners and liner systems leate
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
collection and removal systems storm
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
water man Management systems and the
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
design of landfill caps along with other
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
General design requirements within
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
805 so let's start with the Lee
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
collection removal system design
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
80506 we're looking to add requirements
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
for a backup high water alarm and alarms
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
to Auto dialers and that would alert
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
facility Personnel to the to the we're
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
looking to add those to the requirements
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
for pump stations located outside the
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
footprint in 80506 P these are both
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
related we're adding a requirement that
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
automatic dialers which will alert
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
facility Personnel we're looking to add
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
the requirement that auto dialers to
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
tanks sumps and other lee8 storage units
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh with high water alarms so what we've
 
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
seen recently is an increase in lee8
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
releases and we believe that to be
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
partially due to in some in insufficient
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
or inoperable alarm and notification
 
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
systems Within um at the landfill um
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
most landfills are already equipped
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
these systems so what this is going to
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
do is promote consistent consistency
 
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
among all of the landfills and bring
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
these facilities in line with the normal
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
standards of
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
practice we've also not we've also added
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
Provisions regarding maintenance of
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
806 in the storm water management system
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
design standards we wanted to bring to
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
your attention um the require
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
requirement for systems to be designed
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
for a 50-year storm event as opposed to
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
existing 25-year storm event this is
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
basically you know planning for the
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
potential um once a landfill cap is
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
constructed unless it fails the system
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
will not be upgraded to accommodate the
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
increasing number and frequency of
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
severe weather events that we've seen
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
increasing from the existing 25e storm
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
event to a 50-year storm event also
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
aligns with existing design standards
 
00:23:26.269 --> 00:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
that are set by our alteration of
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
terrain program within their regulations
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
a the alteration of terrain program
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't use a 25e storm event in their
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
rules at all so 50 would put us in line
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
with um other existing regulations for
 
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.870 align:start position:0%
with um other existing regulations for
storm

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
events and then I believe the last item
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
in 05 we wanted to bring to your
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
attention is one specifically relating
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
to Municipal Solid Waste we call mssw
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
landfill design standards and that's
 
00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:55.909 align:start position:0%
landfill design standards and that's
80512

00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
80512
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
a we propose adding a requirement that
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
the bottommost liner of the landfill we
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
call that the secondary liner so in in a
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
landfill be a composite liner and then
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
within this rule we refer to another
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
citation which specifies what a
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
composite liner shall consist of for
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
your awareness landfill permites right
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
now are proactively using composite
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
Liners in portions or all of um of their
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
liner systems without the regulatory
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
requirement and in many states in the
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
area at least one composite liner is
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
required so the language would read
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
existing languages landfills receiving
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
Municipal Solid Waste shall be designed
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
as double lined facilities pursuant to
 
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
80505 new language and the bottommost
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
liner shall be a composite liner
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
pursuant to next Rule and the next rule
 
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
outlines what a composite liner shall
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
consist of which is a geom membrane
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
component next under part 880 six the
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
operating requirements those outline the
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
specifics for operations of a landfill
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
such as waste placement uh when cover
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
material should be placed on an area of
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
a landfill where waste is actively being
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
placed management of leachate management
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
of decomposition gases as well as
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
inspections maintenance and monitoring
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
of an active
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
landfill under the inspections
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance monitoring and Reporting
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
requirements we are adding a section in
 
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.830 align:start position:0%
requirements we are adding a section in
8068

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
D6 so we're adding that liquid in the
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
primary leachate collection system also
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
be tested in July for a suite of
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
Wastewater parameters including pasas so
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
this is the leachate that is produced
 
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
from direct contact with the waste
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
within the primary liner system so the
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
water that filters directly through the
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
waste gets collected at that first
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
bottom that first uh liner touching the
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
waist and this is to ensure that that
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
should a wastewater treatment receiving
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
facility be unexpectedly able on should
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
be I apologize this is to ensure that
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
should a wastewater treatment receiving
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
facility be unexpectedly unable to take
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
the liquid that a commonly accepted
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
Suite of recently conducted analytical
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
characterization testing is available so
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
that the permit can seek can quickly
 
00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
seek a new wastewater treatment
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
facility under our rules landfills are
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
required to have at least two receiving
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
facilities available but we acknowledge
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
that volumes storm events and other
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
disruptions may require quickly seeking
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
seeking another facility this is going
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure that facilities are prepared
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
to flex with the available Wastewater
 
00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:40.230 align:start position:0%
to flex with the available Wastewater
disposal

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
capacity so we're adding an analytical
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
characteristics based on representative
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
samples taken from the primary leech a
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
collection system um and there's it's a
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
list of 10 which I believe are um are
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
commonly accepted it's called the 10
 
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.590 align:start position:0%
commonly accepted it's called the 10
state

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:09.470 align:start position:0%
state
standard

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
so the the receiving facility would have
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
to be prepared to take any leate that
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
had these compounds so this is just to
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's complete
 
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
transparency between we're going to we'd
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
like to ship you our leate here's what
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
it contains to make sure that they're
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
G3 we propose adding a requirement for
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
annual Odor Control reports to be
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
filed right now the way we regulate that
 
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
is is generally through um terms and
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
conditions of individual permits but
 
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:54.519 align:start position:0%
we're looking to standardize that
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
requirement so we're looking to um add
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
an odor an annual Odor Control report so
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
that all landfills are taking a critical
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
look at their operations and striving
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
towards continual Improvement and this
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
would also make our department aware of
 
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
efforts being undertaken and what
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
options might be available so creating a
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
standard of practice some do it some
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
that and then under the general
 
00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
operating other operating standards
 
00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:22.310 align:start position:0%

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
e we are adding a requirement that a
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
pery post to its publicly available
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
website a contact method or information
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
for the public to use to submit
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
questions and issues related to that
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
facility and this is generally to assist
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
in communication when there are issues
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know some issues like odors are
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
temporal and need to be responded to
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
quickly and only if the landfill is
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
notified timely by that um by the person
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
with the complaint um only if they're
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
notified can The Operators respond to to
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
issue moving on to 807 part 807 which
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
are the closure requirements these
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
detail landfill closure and post closure
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
requirements including post closure use
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
and uh post closure use is a brand new
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
section and that's what we wanted to
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to this
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
morning just to set this up previous to
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
this proposed language for post um for
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
post closure use any permit could um um
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
seek approval for any activity at the
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
landfill and our department really had
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
no guard rails on or minimum standards
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
on what we could approve or not approve
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
there was actually just one sentence in
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
the rules and we've struck that that
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
sentence existed in
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
80750 and that language said the permit
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
shall obtain Department approval via the
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
permit modification procedures provided
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
in the rule for any post closure
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
activity at the site not specifically
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
approved by the facility permit so it
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
really left things very general and what
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do by adding the new
 
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.990 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do by adding the new
section

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
80706 is to uh detail Provisions for
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
when approval of a PO post closure use
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
is required we'd like to require some
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
minimum standards on the post-closure
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
use how to seek post closure use
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
approval post closure use construction
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and what occurs when a post
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
closure use
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
ends this is going to assist in
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
encouraging reuse of land while also
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
remaining protective of the
 
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:42.909 align:start position:0%
remaining protective of the
environment

00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely yes uh one of the items
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
that when we first proposed this idea I
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
believe it was it must have been in the
 
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
July public input session I think the
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
the the term we were we were looking at
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
at the time was to prohibit permanent
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
structures on top of a landfill and what
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
we heard very loud and clear was but
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
wait solar arrays could be considered a
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
permanent so we revised the language and
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
what you what we see before you um we
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
change from permanent structure to uh
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
prohibiting residential and commercial
 
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
landfill how do you feel we're
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
okay that's a lot of work uh
 
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
representive Davis
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question my my questions uh
 
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about a setback the setback
 
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
from bodies of water has been changed
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
from 200 feet to 500 feet sure and I'm
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
not sure why that number we had heard a
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony about uh leachate time
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
through through distance and I thought
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
that was on the right track to make each
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
site specific instead of just an
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number I'm I'm just curious
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you for your question um
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
of course the setback is just one of
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
many criteria that the landfill need to
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
meet and uh maybe um a very important
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
criteria to look at at the same time as
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
the 500 foot setback from surface water
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
is the new requirement
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
that um any spills be able to be
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
remediated from groundwater before
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
they before they get off of the property
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
um we focus on protecting the
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
groundwater at landfills and if we
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
protect the groundwater and um then we
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
find that we don't see impacts to
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
surface water New Hampshire's landfills
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh don't show a history of impacting
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
surface water even with our existing
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
rules so taking that in context um when
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
we establish a number like 500 foot set
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
back to surface water in our rules we
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
look at many factors in order to come up
 
00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:10.519 align:start position:0%
with the number um it includes what is
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
protective of the environment and human
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
health what is practicable what
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire rules establish as
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
similar protective standards and what
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
other states establish as protective
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
standards so as leam mentioned the 500
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
foot is um the median minimum setback of
 
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
other states in our region so it's what
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
has been um accepted as protective or
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
even more protective than what many
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
states have in the area uh and also um
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
the floor that we're suggesting for the
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
formation permeability beneath the
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
landfill you look at the typical
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater gradient
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
um typical paracity what you find is
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
that 500 feet gives you about three
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
years of travel time to the surface
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
water body so this is what we're
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
proposing in this draft proposal uh as
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
the 500 foot
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
you yeah I have lots of thoughts um so I
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
don't know if we are you finished
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
presenting in total okay so I didn't
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
want to R um
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
I thank you um thank you madam chair um
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
so one of the other things that I was
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
thinking about was uh going back to the
 
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:40.599 align:start position:0%
auto dialers and the alarms in I think
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:43.950 align:start position:0%
it was
80506

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
80506
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
um is there a list of entities that
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
should be I'm assuming this is an auto
 
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.310 align:start position:0%
should be I'm assuming this is an auto
dialer

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
dialer
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
to municipalities or or the facil like
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
going so it it would
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
be we normally deal with folks that have
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
scada so this would be this would be
 
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.790 align:start position:0%
scada so this would be this would be
alerting

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
alerting
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
facilities real time of any sort of of
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
of issue so it would go it would go to
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
the facility operator owner of that
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
facility does it also then go anywhere
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
else potentially to a municipality or
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
any other entity that might have some
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
Juris ition over the
 
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
issue we could take a look at being a
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
little more prescriptive of that at this
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
point it's it's not that it's not that
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
prescriptive in the in the proposed rule
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay and I would just add that elsewhere
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
in the rule um there are requirements
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
established for when there is an event
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
at a facility they need to contact this
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
list of entities which would include um
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
local authorities and the state so that
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
might they may not be uh notified real
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
time but the operators have the
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
up yeah for a followup no I think do wna
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm good with you're good you said you
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
had a bowon yeah I do have a bon of
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
question I was measuring bowon as one no
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
um my other question then I guess was
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
about the geoc composite liner so Geo
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
obviously means Earth or Earth and like
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
so um is there a limitation on what type
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
of organic materials can be used or is
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
that well
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
defined give me a minute to check to see
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
say we have a section
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
80504 that uh specifies composite liners
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that I'm giving
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:17.309 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
so um what I mentioned during my Fast
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
and Furious was uh 880504 C where
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
composite liner shall consist of a
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
geomembrane liner and a so component but
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
what I failed to mention is 80504 B goes
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in depthness existing
 
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
rule 80504 B uh specifies that
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
geomembrane liners shall meet or exceed
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
the following specifications so the
 
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
liner material shall have a minimum
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
thickness of 60 mil liner material shall
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
be chemically compatible with
 
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated waste and late
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
characteristics and seeming methods with
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
which involve the use of solvents shall
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
incorporate quality assurance quality
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
control procedures to assure protection
 
00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
of groundwater and surface water
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
resources and then again uh C composite
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
liner shall consist of a soil component
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
as specified by a which is a geomembrane
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
liner or a manufactured geosynthetic
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
clay liner which is abbreviated by GCL
 
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
and that would have to have a hydraulic
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
conductivity of not less than 5 * 109
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
cmers per
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
second and if I can please I think if I
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
remember correctly we were considering
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
language before ours which would have
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
been to the negative fifth power so how
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
did you I um when we were talking about
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
other types of legislation before us so
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious of the change or the
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
scope I mean I think we also talked
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
about it relative to distance to travel
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
guess where did that come
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.390 align:start position:0%
guess where did that come
from

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes so um 5 time 10 to the9th would
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
be more protective than 10 to theg 5th
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
and we can talk with our Engineers about
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
that and get back to you about that um
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't I don't have that
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay do you have a
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.150 align:start position:0%
okay do you have a
question

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
so right now the public comment is for
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
days could be 2021 yep 20 days so and
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
after that point then there's then it's
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
all of this whole discussion with the
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
public is cut off no that what we've
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
done so far is uh three informal
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
sessions um two public input listening
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
sessions and then an actual Deliverance
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
of a draft which is what we' sent last
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
week we don't enter formal rul making
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
until we we file an initial proposal and
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
we anticipate doing that
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
in January to February then we start the
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
actual real formal rulemaking process
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
and baked into that is a formal public
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
hearing which will don't hold into this
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
but will'll probably hold sometime
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
around February and that in and of
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
itself comes with a public input and a
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
formal public comment period as well
 
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.750 align:start position:0%
formal public comment period as well
okay

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
so would it be helpful um within this
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
draft to take so much of the legislation
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
it you know I have not I've only gone
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
through about five pages of this I you
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
know focused on a lot of the Bold
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
factors that you have in there but
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
there's a ton of stuff missing and um
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
especially about Hydro geological
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
conditions and um places where a
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
landfill just won't happen and uh and
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
that's some stuff that's that's truly
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
missing also there's nothing that's
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
talked about in that closure area um in
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
regards with
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
landfills that
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
um so for
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
example a landfill is closed in what
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
period of time before and what distance
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
were another landfill like if they put
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
in a permit so for example you have a
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
landfill that's been closed and no one
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
else could propose another landfill in
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
the area for whatever said said date
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
time distance that really should be in
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
there because you know um that's quite
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
protective as well so you have a
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
landfill that's shut down um that's
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
being monitored um you know and somebody
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
wants to literally propose a landfill
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
three or four miles down the road from
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
one that just closed um so that's an
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
incessant burden on an uh on a location
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
so I just don't understand why there's
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
none of these specifics that are in
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
there so would that be helpful that you
 
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
guys get a whole kind of laundry list of
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we feel like are
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
missing site specific stuff and all of
 
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
that we would welcome um from from the
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
committee your
 
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
your a briefing on your thoughts similar
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
to those yes okay thank you that that's
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
the exact reason why we that's the exact
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
reason why ahead of formal will making
 
00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
we've tried to take another step um to
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
give everyone Ample Ample opportunity to
 
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.589 align:start position:0%
give everyone Ample Ample opportunity to
provide

00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
comment to to that regard would it be
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
helpful for the subcommittee to provide
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
some specific questions and then at the
 
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
next session you guys could provide
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
feedback to those questions is that it's
 
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:47.559 align:start position:0%
always going to be helpful from our
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint to be able to help us help
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
you help us help okay and represent
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
Penza if you could take the lead on that
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
in providing them a I
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
know that's so I figured I wasn't too
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
worried about that question is that okay
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
is that Mr chair if I can ask is that a
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
is that something we can all contribute
 
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
to yeah okay absolutely and then we can
 
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
sort of uh have a deadline for when we'd
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
like to have those back to the es for
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
our next meeting yeah I guess I would I
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
would think if it if it works with
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
everyone uh two weeks to get whatever
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
questions we've got to representative
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
Penza then um schedule a a next session
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
to review that and any other updates
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
for uh first week in December maybe does
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
sense is there anyone else um that has I
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
comments I have another question yeah
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely please um before we yeah
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
sorry um one of the other questions that
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
I sort of had or I'm just thinking sort
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
of about here is around your Odor
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
Control report and I'm if I'm looking at
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
the notes correctly um this might be
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
something new or more enumerated than it
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
has been in the past so one of the
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
things that I was curious about was
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not within that older control
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
report you you talk about
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh categorizing or cataloging the data
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
around what actual odors there might be
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
or other types of concerns there might
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
be but are you also listing the the
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
products or items used to control those
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
odors so that individuals who may um
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
have questions later as enumerated in
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
8069 E might have access to that like or
 
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.270 align:start position:0%
8069 E might have access to that like or
those

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
other Odor Control methods rather like I
 
00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
know sometimes there are odorizers and
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
other types of things
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
used thank you for the question I'm not
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
quite sure that I that I follow it it
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to sloppily attempt to answer
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's not the answer that you're
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
looking for um I think the only thing I
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
glommed on to was whether or not was
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
publicly available all of these reports
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
would be provided would be on our
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
website and viewable by the public I
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
know that wasn't your question but I
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
took the opportunity to answer it anyway
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah let me try and rephrase it I
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
guess the the methods that are used to
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
control the odors if there are chemicals
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
applied what are they if there are
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
things used um to what degree do those
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
like a material is sort of report within
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
that Odor Control report so let me take
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
that back to our Engineers I think we're
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
we were still on this the fledgling idea
 
00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:35.559 align:start position:0%
of creating this report and some of you
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
might have have sat on some other recent
 
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
committees where we've um talked about
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
incorporating forms into Rule and so
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
what what we would expect to do is
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
create a form that would be required to
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
be filled out and we would add items
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
just like that if you're going to if
 
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to add an O an odorizer
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
what what does that contain we could
 
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely look at that making that
 
00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.390 align:start position:0%
absolutely look at that making that
require

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
requirement thank you that's more of
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
you okay ladies uh no further questions
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
on from the
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay thank you so much for
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
your hard work and uh and we look
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
forward to working with you over the
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
next several months and we'll uh
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
schedule the next meeting sometime in
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
December early December thank you I
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
notice uh a lot of folks here interested
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
in this topic is there anyone else that
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
has input that's uh gerain to or review
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the de Ru making
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.069 align:start position:0%
 
chair

00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for uh coming and
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh giving your report this morning uh
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
very IM informative uh and one of the
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
questions though that I would direct to
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
you is I'm interested to know for the
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
rules in
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
total um Are there specific rules
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
within your list of rules there that are
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
statuto required
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
um are what I mean by that
 
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
is are there rules there that were
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
specifically mandated to you
 
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
Dees um to have been included in your
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
rules and I'd be interested to know
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
which ones of those they
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
are um and I'd also be interested to
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
know the rule rules that you are now
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
making changes
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
to um to what extent have have they been
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
impacted by any kind of um new
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
technological information that you've uh
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
acquired I know you mentioned before
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
that like with the change to the 200t
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
setback that you've changed it to 500
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
ft that you did that as a median um with
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
respect to what other states surrounding
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
us or other I don't know which
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
particular States um have have had
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
different setback um
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
numbers I just I don't I I I I wouldn't
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
think or I hope that none of
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
these numerical changes that are being
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
made are done arbitrarily but that there
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
is some technological iCal reason why
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
those changes are being made and I I'd
 
00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
like to have a little bit more
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
clarification on um on that particular
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
aspect of those numerical
 
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
changes and I hope I didn't take that
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
over but um those were some questions
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
that came to mind that I believe the
 
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would be interested in uh
 
00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.430 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would be interested in uh
in

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
and representative Murray please thank
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
you and and it is for the department so
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
I apologize for I just wanted to make
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
sure that I was clear on your website
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
you do have a whole administrative rules
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
sort of generator that has the ability
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
to pull things up by category one of
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
them is solid waste um and in there
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
there are sections that uh enumerate um
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
rules is adopted slash or certified and
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
then proposed so my question to you you
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
is um what are the Nuance differences
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
between adopted and certified and can
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
you give us a working definition so that
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
we can move like forward using that same
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
definition I can give you a working
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
definition thanks adopted means that
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
they have gone through the entire formal
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
rle making process certified is they are
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
certified by OS so we receive the final
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
um camera ready version which is called
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
the certified Rule and we receive that
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
from OS and that just depends on um
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes we get them fairly quickly it
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
just depends on 's workload um sometimes
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
it may take six months until the
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
department receives a a true certified
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
copy but for uh for all intensive
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
purposes the adopted rule is the is is
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
the rule it's the rule that we follow um
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
usually the certified rule they might
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know they might find an errant comma
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
um it's never anything that's that's
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
substantive thank you very much and why
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
while you're there uh any response to
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron's question or do
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
you want to get
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
into the details of that at the next
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
session I think it would behoove
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
everyone if we had the opportunity to
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
come back and we could really fully
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
flush out those those questions they're
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
very very uh very good questions okay
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
and and and and a followup to that is
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
and representative Davis
 
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh clarification
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
on site specific requirements especially
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
analysis of the movement of groundwater
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the rate of movement and how and how
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:32.839 align:start position:0%
process and I'm sure that representative
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
Penza will have that question in her
 
00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.910 align:start position:0%
Penza will have that question in her
form

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
too noted thank you thank you ma'am
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
anything else any other aliis
 
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.589 align:start position:0%
anything else any other aliis
representative

00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:49.150 align:start position:0%
representative
Davis

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
Penza one question yes ma'am
 
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
okay so there's been um and I'm sure you
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
guys have heard it there's been a a lot
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
of um constituents I'm in Rochester we
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
have TurnKey landfill there there's a
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
huge odor problem that has been taking
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
place of course because of the amount of
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
rain and um and constituents are feeling
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
as if their voices aren't heard so some
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
of these rule changes will help with
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
that I assume um but where is the
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
monitoring aspect of what's going on um
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
is that a piece I mean I saw some of
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
that in bold that are some changes in um
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
the rules but it seems as if um the
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
complaints are kind of falling on deaf
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
ears and um of course I'm only one
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
so let me make a deal with you why don't
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
when when next time we come we can be
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
prepared to sort of outline the from
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
Soup To Nuts in every part of our rules
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
how complaints are uh investigated how
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
we receive them and how uh sort of our
 
00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
our process to walk through that if that
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
would be helpful because there's there's
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
different parts and different rules that
 
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
deal with um odor complaints or
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
different nuisance complaints and
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
they're not just in the landfill
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
sighting rules we have overall rules
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
overarching rules in the 1,00 and 1100s
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
that speak a bit to that so I'll make a
 
00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:15.559 align:start position:0%
note of that and we can come prepared to
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
discuss that topic in
 
00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:20.799 align:start position:0%
totality any
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
albas all right okay uh if there are no
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
further questions then uh I will
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
schedule a meeting for first week in
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
December and uh we'll get back and get
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
into some more details and see how the
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
progress is going again thank you so

seconds would you like to speak to your
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
motion representative Bixby yes so um we
 
03:12:36.110 --> 03:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
got a uh report from the uh Board of
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
pides control subcommittee that was uh
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
doing that was studying this and they
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
that report indicated that the federal
 
03:12:48.229 --> 03:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
government was likely go to be uh
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
putting forward final rules uh in the
 
03:12:54.830 --> 03:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
near future to cover this to to deal
 
03:12:59.229 --> 03:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
with this issue and uh they had a um
 
03:13:02.349 --> 03:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
essentially a summary of those rules and
 
03:13:04.910 --> 03:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
what the feds were proposing is more
 
03:13:06.790 --> 03:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
thorough than anything we could come up
 
03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
with for a bill and more more targeted
 
03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:13:15.389 --> 03:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
uh it makes sense to let the federal
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
government bring that forward it should
 
03:13:21.030 --> 03:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
be uh latest word is those should be
 
03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
coming out in uh December or January uh
 
03:13:29.070 --> 03:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
if there uh the federal government does
 
03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
not come up with something uh by the end
 
03:13:35.830 --> 03:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
of the of the spring we can go to the F
 
03:13:38.950 --> 03:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
to our pde control board and request
 
03:13:40.229 --> 03:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
that they do something at the state
 
03:13:42.030 --> 03:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
level they have that Authority without
 
03:13:45.990 --> 03:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
our leg legislation uh and we can uh
 
03:13:47.830 --> 03:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
work with it at that point but I'm
 
03:13:50.990 --> 03:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
hoping that the feds will have uh put
 
03:13:53.150 --> 03:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
forward their regulations by then and we
 
03:13:56.030 --> 03:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
won't and and that will help cover the
 
03:13:58.150 --> 03:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
whole country with it so um we don't
 
03:14:00.229 --> 03:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
need to do it at
 
03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:03.600 align:start position:0%

03:15:30.750 --> 03:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby would you like to
 
03:15:34.590 --> 03:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes so um the in
 
03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
our discussion last week about this uh
 
03:15:40.189 --> 03:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
Bill there were uh a couple of questions
 
03:15:44.269 --> 03:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
raised uh one was whether uh the
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation that is uh in the
 
03:15:53.150 --> 03:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
bill uh which uh is for fiscal year uh
 
03:15:56.950 --> 03:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
2025 uh would uh whether the fact that
 
03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
that is just a one-year appropriation uh
 
03:16:02.110 --> 03:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
whether that would create a problem in
 
03:16:04.269 --> 03:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
terms of whether the whether this
 
03:16:07.269 --> 03:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
program would continue on and I talked
 
03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
with OLS and they said unless there is
 
03:16:11.550 --> 03:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that specifically
 
03:16:14.670 --> 03:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
says that uh it will end after that
 
03:16:17.030 --> 03:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation then it's the Department's
 
03:16:19.550 --> 03:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility to continue the program
 
03:16:23.429 --> 03:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
going by uh making appro making any
 
03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
necessary Appropriations in the
 
03:16:29.070 --> 03:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
following Year's budget uh so uh that
 
03:16:32.070 --> 03:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
and he said that the bill as drafted was
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
or the amendment as
 
03:16:37.269 --> 03:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
drafted uh drafted was entirely
 
03:16:40.189 --> 03:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that um the second thing
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
that came up in our discussions last
 
03:16:42.600 --> 03:16:43.710 align:start position:0%
that came up in our discussions last
week

03:16:43.710 --> 03:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
was the uh the question of what counts
 
03:16:51.950 --> 03:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
as a farm and uh what I had used on used
 
03:16:55.070 --> 03:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
in the uh amendment that I was uh that I
 
03:16:58.830 --> 03:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
brought in last week was uh a reference
 
03:17:03.070 --> 03:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
to uh schedule F on on uh for federal
 
03:17:07.550 --> 03:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
taxes and it was noted by uh both Rob
 
03:17:10.510 --> 03:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
Johnson from the Farm Bureau and by uh
 
03:17:15.309 --> 03:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
Mr Wilmer uh from the uh from C
 
03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
extension that uh that could
 
03:17:22.269 --> 03:17:22.279 align:start position:0%
inadvertently exclude some people and uh
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Wilmer from the from extension gave
 
03:17:29.229 --> 03:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
me some language that extension uses
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
for uh their Farm mental health program
 
03:17:36.670 --> 03:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
that uh they have found is very good in
 
03:17:39.389 --> 03:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
terms of uh determining whether a farm
 
03:17:41.229 --> 03:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
is a farm in the business for it as
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
opposed to a hobby Farm uh and uh so I
 
03:17:48.590 --> 03:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh amended this amendment uses the
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
language that I got from uh Mr Wilmer uh
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
H with uh uh some minor adjustments in
 
03:17:58.590 --> 03:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
order to make the the the grammar
 
03:18:01.710 --> 03:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
workout correctly for a bill but um
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's uh that the language on what
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
counts as a farm is essentially drawn
 
03:18:09.710 --> 03:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
from uh that existing program under
 
03:18:13.150 --> 03:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
Co-op extension uh the
 
03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment as a whole uh basically
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
takes what was uh initially proposed as
 
03:18:22.830 --> 03:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
a as a task force which would have
 
03:18:25.389 --> 03:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
gotten uh a number of highlevel people
 
03:18:27.630 --> 03:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
into a room to talk about how we could
 
03:18:30.110 --> 03:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
have uh better support for energy
 
03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure on farms into a program
 
03:18:38.189 --> 03:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
to actually do that uh and uh what this
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
does is it uh creates a program within
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
the department of
 
03:18:47.189 --> 03:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh that uh says that uh
 
03:18:48.670 --> 03:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
there should
 
03:18:51.550 --> 03:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
be an education program available for
 
03:18:54.469 --> 03:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
Farmers that focuses on Farm Energy
 
03:18:56.710 --> 03:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
Systems and farm uh engineering
 
03:19:00.150 --> 03:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure engineering and uh
 
03:19:03.670 --> 03:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
provides advising for that so is housed
 
03:19:05.469 --> 03:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
in the Department of Agriculture the
 
03:19:07.710 --> 03:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
department of a agriculture will
 
03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
contract with Cooperative Extension
 
03:19:12.750 --> 03:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
using a memorandum of understanding
 
03:19:16.510 --> 03:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
to get this work done uh and it is uh
 
03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
and it would be one one extension field
 
03:19:21.790 --> 03:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
specialist who would be performing that
 
03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
work uh and this is an exact this is
 
03:19:29.309 --> 03:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
basically um the same model that the uh
 
03:19:32.469 --> 03:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
division of lands and forests uses for
 
03:19:32.479 --> 03:19:33.349 align:start position:0%
division of lands and forests uses for
County

03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
County
 
03:19:37.309 --> 03:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
Foresters uh the uh requirement for the
 
03:19:41.790 --> 03:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
county Forest uh education is uh for for
 
03:19:45.990 --> 03:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
for Forest foresting education is set in
 
03:19:48.389 --> 03:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh lands and uh division of lands and
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
Forest statutes and it says that the
 
03:19:54.750 --> 03:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
division will use a memorandum of of
 
03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
understanding with extension to have
 
03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
that uh forestry work done and uh so
 
03:20:04.110 --> 03:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's basically uh the department
 
03:20:07.830 --> 03:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
Contracting with extension uh so if
 
03:20:10.150 --> 03:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions about how that
 
03:20:13.309 --> 03:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
works uh we have to answer
 
03:20:16.229 --> 03:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
them okay representative
 
03:20:19.229 --> 03:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:20:22.110 --> 03:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
representative viby uh for for the
 
03:20:25.389 --> 03:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
amendment um I do have concerns about
 
03:20:28.990 --> 03:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
the criteria for a farm and I think it
 
03:20:32.030 --> 03:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
excludes a huge population of beginning
 
03:20:35.670 --> 03:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
Farmers or people that are trying to
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
farm in a crop isn't ready for 3 to four
 
03:20:42.110 --> 03:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
years such as a a Vineyard um because
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
because uh the the three criterias here
 
03:20:50.030 --> 03:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
do not include those Farms because one
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's not contributing to their living
 
03:20:53.309 --> 03:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
costs at the
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
moment it's may be their principal
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
occupation but they're not
 
03:21:01.070 --> 03:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
deriving any income from it and usually
 
03:21:03.070 --> 03:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
they have a secondary source of income
 
03:21:06.670 --> 03:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
until it's up and running and until
 
03:21:09.710 --> 03:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's up and running they're not going
 
03:21:12.269 --> 03:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
to you know they're they're they
 
03:21:15.830 --> 03:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
supplementing uh their income and I
 
03:21:18.429 --> 03:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
think that we're doing a disservice to
 
03:21:20.309 --> 03:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
the other farmers in New Hampshire by
 
03:21:20.319 --> 03:21:23.630 align:start position:0%
the other farmers in New Hampshire by
excluding

03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
them anyone else representative Murray
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you uh
 
03:21:33.229 --> 03:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative Kat for your thoughts um
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
I also think that addition anytime we
 
03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
can provide additional resources for
 
03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
Farms um related to energy relief given
 
03:21:43.110 --> 03:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
all of the instances in which we are
 
03:21:44.950 --> 03:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
seeing sort of changes in our
 
03:21:46.750 --> 03:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
environment are vitally important to the
 
03:21:48.110 --> 03:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
availability of supporting and
 
03:21:49.870 --> 03:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
diversifying our food and farming
 
03:21:52.750 --> 03:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
initiatives so for that reason um I am
 
03:21:56.269 --> 03:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
in support of HB uh 369 uh and the
 
03:21:58.510 --> 03:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that we are is before US
 
03:21:58.520 --> 03:21:59.550 align:start position:0%
amendment that we are is before US
Representative

03:21:59.550 --> 03:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
03:22:03.950 --> 03:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
Duty uh yes thank you madam chair um I
 
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
hear what representative quam coma is
 
03:22:09.070 --> 03:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
saying however I really feel that this
 
03:22:12.110 --> 03:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
is a first good step that is going going
 
03:22:15.870 --> 03:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
to uh assist a number of the established
 
03:22:19.030 --> 03:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
farms in New Hampshire um so I would
 
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
hope that we would uh pass this
 
03:22:24.229 --> 03:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
amendment and this legislation and if in
 
03:22:26.189 --> 03:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
the future we feel that there should be
 
03:22:26.199 --> 03:22:27.229 align:start position:0%
the future we feel that there should be
some

03:22:27.229 --> 03:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
modifications um I think we can do that
 
03:22:32.189 --> 03:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime I think a lot of
 
03:22:35.790 --> 03:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
farms are going to uh find a benefit
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
from a program that can get up and
 
03:22:39.309 --> 03:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
running pretty
 
03:22:42.349 --> 03:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
quickly representative ger
 
03:22:43.830 --> 03:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is a a
 
03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
question for representative Bixby the um
 
03:22:49.439 --> 03:22:50.309 align:start position:0%
question for representative Bixby the um
the

03:22:50.309 --> 03:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:52.469 --> 03:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
amendment defines
 
03:22:56.429 --> 03:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
Farm as says Farm means a farming
 
03:22:59.710 --> 03:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
operation as defined in RSA
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.389 --> 03:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
234a it would seem to include the
 
03:23:08.670 --> 03:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
Enterprises that representative ktoa is
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
referring to the word Farm means any
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
land buildings or structures on which or
 
03:23:15.790 --> 03:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
in which Agriculture and farming
 
03:23:17.710 --> 03:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
operations or activity are carried out
 
03:23:17.720 --> 03:23:18.389 align:start position:0%
operations or activity are carried out
or

03:23:18.389 --> 03:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:23:22.269 --> 03:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
conducted um so doesn't
 
03:23:24.990 --> 03:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
234a which is cited in the amendment
 
03:23:27.429 --> 03:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
cover uh the and and I agree with
 
03:23:28.750 --> 03:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
representative compto that they should
 
03:23:31.150 --> 03:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
be covered but my question is does does
 
03:23:31.160 --> 03:23:32.189 align:start position:0%
be covered but my question is does does
that

03:23:32.189 --> 03:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:35.150 --> 03:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
RSA cover those Enterprises that are
 
03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative comp was asking about Mr
 
03:23:39.429 --> 03:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby that was directed
 
03:23:42.630 --> 03:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
to you yes um so
 
03:23:46.510 --> 03:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
the uh I think that representative coma
 
03:23:49.110 --> 03:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
does have a point in that there there
 
03:23:51.510 --> 03:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
might be some Farms that are excluded
 
03:23:54.030 --> 03:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
however I'd like to also point out that
 
03:23:55.790 --> 03:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh we are the first body that is
 
03:23:57.870 --> 03:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
considering this piece of legislation
 
03:24:02.670 --> 03:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't in general like saying
 
03:24:05.469 --> 03:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
let the Senate fix it however one of the
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
things that um that that I am I I think
 
03:24:13.030 --> 03:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
might be helpful is that uh the former
 
03:24:14.990 --> 03:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee is on the Senate
 
03:24:18.349 --> 03:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
body that will be hearing this and uh he
 
03:24:22.429 --> 03:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
is uh maybe better versed in I probably
 
03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
should have consulted with him about
 
03:24:27.910 --> 03:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
this language before I got a prob went
 
03:24:31.349 --> 03:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
through it but uh he is better versed in
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
what should be here than um than perhaps
 
03:24:38.189 --> 03:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
I am and if it requires amending at the
 
03:24:40.710 --> 03:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
Senate uh when it gets to the Senate I'm
 
03:24:44.309 --> 03:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
sure that will happen happen uh and uh I
 
03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
think that in the in order to get this
 
03:24:52.349 --> 03:24:52.359 align:start position:0%
uh this program up and running faster it
 
03:24:55.950 --> 03:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
makes more sense to pass it now than to
 
03:24:58.830 --> 03:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
wait another couple of years until it
 
03:24:58.840 --> 03:24:59.710 align:start position:0%
wait another couple of years until it
has

03:24:59.710 --> 03:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:25:03.389 --> 03:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
a uh it makes more uh in order to get
 
03:25:06.150 --> 03:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
the language perfect so uh the language
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
may not be perfect now but in order to
 
03:25:13.389 --> 03:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
get this uh get this out there so that
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
farmers can start using it I think we
 
03:25:18.510 --> 03:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
should pass it now representative
 
03:25:21.630 --> 03:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair I think
 
03:25:24.910 --> 03:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
that the um intent of this amendment of
 
03:25:27.309 --> 03:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
creating this position that for Farmers
 
03:25:30.349 --> 03:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
to reach out to for help would not
 
03:25:32.349 --> 03:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily be one that someone who is
 
03:25:34.110 --> 03:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
in the position that that representative
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
ktoa has mentioned I think that if you
 
03:25:38.830 --> 03:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
are in the early stages of farming you
 
03:25:40.870 --> 03:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
have a day job so you can Farm you know
 
03:25:42.269 --> 03:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
on the side
 
03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
and see if your farm survives you're not
 
03:25:49.830 --> 03:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
ready to take on a a an array of um of
 
03:25:52.349 --> 03:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
solar panels or
 
03:25:54.990 --> 03:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
whatever representative verville thank
 
03:25:57.790 --> 03:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I I agree with the
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
the ranking member we shouldn't send
 
03:26:01.309 --> 03:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
bills that are flawed off to the senate
 
03:26:03.510 --> 03:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
in hopes that they they they correct it
 
03:26:06.110 --> 03:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
so I I agree with them 100% there my my
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
challenge with this bill is that it
 
03:26:10.990 --> 03:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
grows the size of government it spends
 
03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:11.910 align:start position:0%
grows the size of government it spends
money

03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:26:15.429 --> 03:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
that we know is tight for and I and I
 
03:26:17.710 --> 03:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
see the faces but hear me out for
 
03:26:21.710 --> 03:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
duplicative efforts there are so many
 
03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
groups and
 
03:26:26.710 --> 03:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
organizations that are Consulting and
 
03:26:29.389 --> 03:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
providing assistance both both Technical
 
03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
and financial for alternative energy um
 
03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
schemes for for this that and the other
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
thing and I don't know any of them that
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
discriminates against Farms that would
 
03:26:43.030 --> 03:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
be say just for an office building or or
 
03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
for for maybe a strip mall or whatever
 
03:26:47.710 --> 03:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
the business may be but yet this bill
 
03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to Target to to just Farmers
 
03:26:52.590 --> 03:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
so for me because it's duplicated
 
03:26:54.670 --> 03:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
because there are already so many
 
03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
programs like this I I I don't feel that
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
this is a good use of taxpayer money and
 
03:27:01.710 --> 03:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
for that reason I'm a no thank you madam
 
03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
chair okay anyone else representative
 
03:27:07.630 --> 03:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes so
 
03:27:10.510 --> 03:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
um we had we heard from Mr Wilmer from
 
03:27:14.710 --> 03:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
cooperative extension last uh last week
 
03:27:17.349 --> 03:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
that uh one of the advantages in having
 
03:27:19.110 --> 03:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension do this sort of
 
03:27:23.710 --> 03:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
work is that they are they don't have a
 
03:27:27.030 --> 03:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh they don't have money involved in it
 
03:27:32.590 --> 03:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
so if you go to a uh an to a uh solar
 
03:27:35.710 --> 03:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
panel firm and say I want you know I
 
03:27:40.349 --> 03:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
want to some advice on how to um improve
 
03:27:43.590 --> 03:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
my energy infrastructure on the farm
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
they may direct you just towards solar
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
panels and what uh and I I don't
 
03:27:52.910 --> 03:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
remember the exact uh example that Mr
 
03:27:54.830 --> 03:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
Wilmer gave but he gave an example of
 
03:27:56.550 --> 03:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
one farm that he had worked with where
 
03:28:00.429 --> 03:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
he they had gotten advice from a someone
 
03:28:02.269 --> 03:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
a professional in the field and that
 
03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
advice actually didn't make sense
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
because it didn't take into into account
 
03:28:09.229 --> 03:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
the enti the whole uh the holistic
 
03:28:13.030 --> 03:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
function of the farm so maybe maybe what
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
the farm needs isn't solar panels maybe
 
03:28:18.110 --> 03:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
it is something that will uh you know a
 
03:28:19.910 --> 03:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
battery bank that will create buffering
 
03:28:23.950 --> 03:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
against uh demand charges and that the
 
03:28:25.389 --> 03:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
solar panels wouldn't make the most
 
03:28:27.790 --> 03:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
sense at that point or maybe it is uh
 
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
installing you know um a uh Reverse
 
03:28:35.670 --> 03:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
Osmosis System something that the that
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
the solar panel firm wouldn't
 
03:28:40.830 --> 03:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily know about uh what this
 
03:28:43.189 --> 03:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
position is is someone who will know
 
03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
enough about Farm Technology including
 
03:28:49.630 --> 03:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate energy technology to help
 
03:28:51.950 --> 03:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
advise the farm specifically on their
 
03:28:56.389 --> 03:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
needs for making a holistic program uh
 
03:28:59.189 --> 03:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh technical upgrade to the farm as
 
03:29:01.590 --> 03:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to the peac meal advice that you
 
03:29:04.510 --> 03:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
might get from another source so uh this
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
is not dup duplicative it is in fact
 
03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
something that is very appropriately
 
03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
targeted for our farming
 
03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
Community thank you representative ger
 
03:29:18.670 --> 03:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah I I wanted to
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh also uh representative Bixby beat me
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
to the punch a little bit but with due
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
respect my colleague at the end of the
 
03:29:27.189 --> 03:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
table here uh representative verville
 
03:29:28.750 --> 03:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
say this isn't duplicative what the
 
03:29:31.630 --> 03:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard was that it
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
actually would allow the agency to
 
03:29:35.790 --> 03:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
expand the kinds of services they
 
03:29:38.469 --> 03:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
already provide the testimony made it
 
03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
clear that this was really valuable uh
 
03:29:44.070 --> 03:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh information help that our Farmers
 
03:29:46.750 --> 03:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
need we're doing it now this would allow
 
03:29:48.189 --> 03:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
us to
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
expand those services and uh and extend
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
the benefit to more Farmers so it's not
 
03:29:57.309 --> 03:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
duplicative it expands on something that
 
03:29:59.550 --> 03:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
we're already
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
doing representative
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
Howard in fact um in question in the
 
03:30:06.150 --> 03:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
question and answer with that with Mr
 
03:30:08.189 --> 03:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
Winer he I asked him if it was a
 
03:30:10.189 --> 03:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
necessary redundancy and an expansion of
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
expertise and he said that um that there
 
03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
would be an expectation that they would
 
03:30:17.389 --> 03:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
be helping with things that are already
 
03:30:19.309 --> 03:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
in existence but there would be an
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
expansion of expertise and I'm pretty
 
03:30:23.910 --> 03:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
sure that the um services are offered
 
03:30:27.269 --> 03:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
without charge from the extension
 
03:30:27.279 --> 03:30:28.990 align:start position:0%
without charge from the extension
represent

03:30:28.990 --> 03:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:30:32.110 --> 03:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
verval so to paraphrase what I heard
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
these things are already being offered
 
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to expand the program
 
03:30:38.110 --> 03:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
if the extension wants to expand the
 
03:30:40.389 --> 03:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
program then I would say uh in another
 
03:30:41.790 --> 03:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
year when we be begin the state
 
03:30:43.630 --> 03:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
budgeting process they should put in for
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
an exp expanded program um at that time
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
and not do this um outside of the
 
03:30:52.469 --> 03:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
outside of the budgeting process this is
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
this is expanding stuff that we're
 
03:30:56.469 --> 03:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
already doing they could do that they
 
03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
could certainly do that um without us so
 
03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
um with that I would say I would say no
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
this is this is not uh not a bill I can
 
03:31:08.910 --> 03:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
support thank you madam chair anyone
 
03:31:11.590 --> 03:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
else representative ger
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mam I would just add that
 
03:31:17.349 --> 03:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
we talked about that already uh and uh
 
03:31:18.790 --> 03:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
some folks on the committee brought up
 
03:31:20.590 --> 03:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that different counties may be
 
03:31:22.189 --> 03:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
willing to contribute more to the
 
03:31:24.389 --> 03:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
extension to try to expand these
 
03:31:26.670 --> 03:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
services but as we talked about that is
 
03:31:28.950 --> 03:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
a separate kind of process it involves
 
03:31:30.550 --> 03:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
decisions that are made at the county
 
03:31:34.349 --> 03:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
level that we can't know or or depend on
 
03:31:38.710 --> 03:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
so the the question about how uh through
 
03:31:42.309 --> 03:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
um uh the uh extension services this
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
could be done as you said we we had that
 
03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
discussion and the um the official who
 
03:31:50.269 --> 03:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
spoke with us at our last hearing made
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
it clear that this was a way to provide
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
those Services now and that in the
 
03:31:57.229 --> 03:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
future there is the possibility for
 
03:31:59.590 --> 03:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
expansion on on the uh on the part of
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
extension but uh that this committee can
 
03:32:04.469 --> 03:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
do something now without waiting for
 
03:32:05.790 --> 03:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
that to happen so I just want to
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
reiterate that was part of the
 
03:32:09.030 --> 03:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I would remind our our
 
03:32:10.670 --> 03:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
committee that we had about this bill
 
03:32:10.680 --> 03:32:11.830 align:start position:0%
committee that we had about this bill
last

03:32:11.830 --> 03:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:32:14.229 --> 03:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
time representative Ville thank you
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
madam chair so what I would what I would
 
03:32:18.910 --> 03:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
say is if the bill was more expansive
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
and not so targeted so that the the
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
group that's reaping benefit from this I
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
mean if this is really that that needed
 
03:32:28.349 --> 03:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
it can't be just that needed on farms
 
03:32:30.269 --> 03:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
there have to be other businesses there
 
03:32:33.030 --> 03:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
have to be uh other other aspects of our
 
03:32:35.349 --> 03:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
communities that could benefit from such
 
03:32:38.469 --> 03:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
consultation from from state government
 
03:32:40.870 --> 03:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
and when we narrowly focus it down into
 
03:32:43.349 --> 03:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
farms for me it becomes less palatable
 
03:32:45.550 --> 03:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
if it was a more Universal program Open
 
03:32:47.710 --> 03:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
to more people I would be more receptive
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
to it but at this point um it it's too
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
tightly narrow representative
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair just to be
 
03:32:58.269 --> 03:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
clear we're voting the the motion on the
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
table is OTP on the amendment yes on the
 
03:33:02.030 --> 03:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
amendment okay so we're everyone's
 
03:33:05.229 --> 03:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the bill um so if we vote
 
03:33:06.630 --> 03:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:33:09.389 --> 03:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
amendment and it passes then we'll go to
 
03:33:12.550 --> 03:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
otpa yes sir and that and that's based
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
on the amendment if we vote on the
 
03:33:17.469 --> 03:33:17.479 align:start position:0%
amendment and it fails then the next
 
03:33:19.710 --> 03:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
minut the next vote is on the initial
 
03:33:22.349 --> 03:33:22.359 align:start position:0%
bill right with without the amendment
 
03:33:23.910 --> 03:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay so I just wanted to make
 
03:33:26.309 --> 03:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
sure that that was what we're voting on
 
03:33:28.510 --> 03:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
okay represent Murray uh thank you madam
 
03:33:30.429 --> 03:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
chair regarding the amendment and to to
 
03:33:32.550 --> 03:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
your point uh representative I just want
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
03:33:38.229 --> 03:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
um I understand what you are uh talking
 
03:33:40.750 --> 03:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
about in in your desire to expand the PO
 
03:33:43.070 --> 03:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
potential pool or applicant pool of
 
03:33:45.590 --> 03:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
types of entities that might uh use such
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
a service I think we talked about that
 
03:33:49.110 --> 03:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
at length during our last Committee
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
hearing and um we really uh at least
 
03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
from what I was understanding in the in
 
03:33:56.550 --> 03:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
the general Vibe of our conversation was
 
03:33:58.710 --> 03:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we we felt like Farms really do
 
03:34:01.349 --> 03:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
need to have an additional Avenue and a
 
03:34:04.830 --> 03:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
a sort of a um a source to in addition
 
03:34:06.910 --> 03:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
to programs like reap have other
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
resources available to them to be able
 
03:34:11.790 --> 03:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
to um look at other alternative um
 
03:34:13.870 --> 03:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
energy options so I just wanted to make
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we're clear there thank you I
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%

this but I think we have discussed it so
 
03:36:08.469 --> 03:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
um because the amendment does replace

close out the uh exec on HB
 
03:39:53.710 --> 03:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
493 and open the exact on HB 602
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
relative to landfill sighting do I hear
 
03:39:58.389 --> 03:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
um a
 
03:40:01.630 --> 03:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
motion represent Penza yes I'd like to
 
03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
make a motion to amend with uh
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
223-233 3H on HB 602 do I hear a second
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative hasin seconds
 
03:40:15.510 --> 03:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative penzo would you like to
 
03:40:20.070 --> 03:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
please so HB 602 is replaced with a in a
 
03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
sense a preliminary application process
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
so most other states have a two-step
 
03:40:32.910 --> 03:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
process some even a three-step process
 
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
for new landfill applications wherein
 
03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
the developer only needs to submit a
 
03:40:40.429 --> 03:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
preliminary application so by requiring
 
03:40:42.910 --> 03:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
an initial application early
 
03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
identification of unsuitable sites can
 
03:40:47.389 --> 03:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
be identified and eliminated from
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
consideration without prejudice early
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
this helps avoid investing time and
 
03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
resources in a site that will ultimately
 
03:40:56.830 --> 03:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
be deemed unsuitable for a landfill
 
03:40:58.990 --> 03:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
saving both the applicant and agency
 
03:41:02.990 --> 03:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
valuable resources and if D Dees wishes
 
03:41:05.229 --> 03:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
it can signal to the developer and the
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
public that by approving a preliminary
 
03:41:10.150 --> 03:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
application the presumption is that the
 
03:41:12.510 --> 03:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
entire application will likely be
 
03:41:14.670 --> 03:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
approved with or without
 
03:41:17.070 --> 03:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
modifications overall a two-step process
 
03:41:18.750 --> 03:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
for new landfill applications helps
 
03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
ensure a more robust and comprehensive
 
03:41:23.630 --> 03:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
proposal evaluation leading to better
 
03:41:25.630 --> 03:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
decision-making reduced environmental
 
03:41:27.630 --> 03:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
and public health risks and increased
 
03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
public trust in the landfill approval
 
03:41:32.670 --> 03:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
process it is also intended to promote
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
sustainability and compliance with
 
03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:37.189 align:start position:0%
sustainability and compliance with
environmental

03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
03:41:39.070 --> 03:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
regulations thank you for that do we
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
have any discussion on this
 
03:41:42.910 --> 03:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
03:41:45.149 --> 03:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
chair I'd just like to say that we think
 
03:41:47.309 --> 03:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
our Amendment clarifies some of the
 
03:41:50.229 --> 03:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
language um we also think that it gives
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
Dees the kind of direction that we
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
believe they're looking for so we see
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
this as a positive step to both um
 
03:42:00.429 --> 03:42:00.439 align:start position:0%
protect the environment and also allow
 
03:42:03.389 --> 03:42:03.399 align:start position:0%
industry the chance to submit in a
 
03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
two-step process their permit
 
03:42:07.750 --> 03:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
application and get a ruling on that
 
03:42:12.790 --> 03:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
before we go further thank you thank you
 
03:42:14.309 --> 03:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any comments
 
03:42:16.710 --> 03:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative Howard I have one
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
question um so uh representative Penza
 
03:42:21.790 --> 03:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that it would that it the
 
03:42:23.830 --> 03:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
presumption that it would pass is part
 
03:42:26.110 --> 03:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
would be the result of of the passage of
 
03:42:28.910 --> 03:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
the first part the the second part would
 
03:42:32.189 --> 03:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
would be passed is that true or is that
 
03:42:35.309 --> 03:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
in the bill I didn't see that no no no
 
03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
no no so B basically it's for for the
 
03:42:42.149 --> 03:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
industry so if an industry gets their
 
03:42:44.830 --> 03:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
pre-application approved most likely
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
that is positive for them you know on
 
03:42:50.670 --> 03:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
the advice of Dees of course that it was
 
03:42:52.110 --> 03:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
probably going to move forward with or
 
03:42:54.510 --> 03:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
without modifications so it's it's also
 
03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
signaling to you know the applicant that
 
03:42:59.990 --> 03:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know things look good on a
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
preliminary fashion but that's not in
 
03:43:02.239 --> 03:43:03.189 align:start position:0%
preliminary fashion but that's not in
the

03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:06.910 --> 03:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
bill anyone else represent ger thank you
 
03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair just like to briefly
 
03:43:11.070 --> 03:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
reiterate uh my point of in our last uh
 
03:43:12.830 --> 03:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
meeting in support of the bill which is
 
03:43:15.269 --> 03:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
that in numerous meetings with Dees what
 
03:43:18.189 --> 03:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
they repeatedly ask us for is uh a
 
03:43:20.349 --> 03:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
balance between Direction and
 
03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
flexibility and and I think this does
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
exactly that so we're giving them
 
03:43:25.590 --> 03:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
Direction in terms of having this
 
03:43:27.670 --> 03:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
preliminary process but we are not
 
03:43:29.389 --> 03:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
dictating any content we are not
 
03:43:31.469 --> 03:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
dictating any criteria we're not telling
 
03:43:34.110 --> 03:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
them how to do their jobs we're simply
 
03:43:36.269 --> 03:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
setting up a preliminary stage that will
 
03:43:39.550 --> 03:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
save both Dees and the companies who are
 
03:43:41.389 --> 03:43:41.399 align:start position:0%
applying time and
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
money anyone else representative Bixby
 
03:43:48.229 --> 03:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so um there's some question about
 
03:43:52.149 --> 03:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
whether uh the current uh rules process
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
that Dees is already going through uh
 
03:43:57.670 --> 03:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
whe whether this bill might create some
 
03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
sort of a conflict with that and in fact
 
03:44:01.149 --> 03:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
I think that this is actually a
 
03:44:05.229 --> 03:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
complimentary Bill uh because uh for the
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
for the full permit process Dees needs
 
03:44:11.070 --> 03:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
to put together those rules uh in any
 
03:44:15.389 --> 03:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
case and once they have those rule the
 
03:44:18.830 --> 03:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
rules for the full permit process uh
 
03:44:21.990 --> 03:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
established they will know better what
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
would count as a uh very as a highly
 
03:44:27.630 --> 03:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
problematic situation versus something
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
that could be uh corrected by uh a
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
permit U modific or an application
 
03:44:37.469 --> 03:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
modification and they can use that
 
03:44:40.510 --> 03:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what would be a a re you
 
03:44:43.349 --> 03:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
know an unsurmountable problem in order
 
03:44:45.510 --> 03:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
to come up with their list of what would
 
03:44:48.389 --> 03:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
count as a prohibitive condition uh for
 
03:44:52.950 --> 03:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
that for that pre- permit process and so
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
I think that this that uh this bill
 
03:44:58.189 --> 03:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
actually works uh nicely in conjunction
 
03:45:01.630 --> 03:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
with uh their current rules man rules
 
03:45:01.640 --> 03:45:02.830 align:start position:0%
with uh their current rules man rules
updating

03:45:02.830 --> 03:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
updating
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
process thank you representative
 
03:45:08.070 --> 03:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
verville thank you madam chair so I I'm
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
I'm a no on this and the reason I'm a no
 
03:45:13.349 --> 03:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
on this is I find it hard to believe
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
that a company that's going to try to
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
site a
 
03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
landfill is not going to do their
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
homework early and often to try to dot
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
every i and cross every T before
 
03:45:31.149 --> 03:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
proceeding forward it seems to me that a
 
03:45:33.950 --> 03:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
corporation wouldn't take a a two-phase
 
03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
approach where they took a they take a
 
03:45:40.110 --> 03:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
very uh broad 40,000 foot view of it G
 
03:45:41.950 --> 03:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
whiz you know this this looks like it'll
 
03:45:44.870 --> 03:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
fit let's propose it and then we can dig
 
03:45:47.309 --> 03:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
down into the details later as long as
 
03:45:50.070 --> 03:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
they they green light it that's that's
 
03:45:51.870 --> 03:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
not really that's not really how
 
03:45:55.990 --> 03:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
business uh evaluates risk on investment
 
03:45:59.429 --> 03:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
so I I find it hard to believe that any
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
company would propose sighting a
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
landfill somewhere where they honestly
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
believe that they did not stand a very
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
good chance of meeting all the
 
03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
permitting require reement so that they
 
03:46:13.990 --> 03:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
can get their their project uh approved
 
03:46:16.269 --> 03:46:16.279 align:start position:0%
in fact one of the one of the biggest
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
fears of of any
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
investment is that you miss a
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
detail that comes in at the 11th hour
 
03:46:28.269 --> 03:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
and and burns the house down right
 
03:46:30.110 --> 03:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
because it it happens there are
 
03:46:32.349 --> 03:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunate uh oversights when people
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
are assessing risk and making plans to
 
03:46:36.670 --> 03:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
go forward there's always the unforeseen
 
03:46:38.510 --> 03:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes those unforeseen
 
03:46:41.469 --> 03:46:41.479 align:start position:0%
things uh cause the cause failure in the
 
03:46:44.349 --> 03:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
in the project and so for for that
 
03:46:47.189 --> 03:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
reason I I don't think that this bill is
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
necessary it's my opinion um that that
 
03:46:53.229 --> 03:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
the state has a process for this um and
 
03:46:55.710 --> 03:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
that this isn't required and with all
 
03:46:57.990 --> 03:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
due respect for that reason I'm a no
 
03:47:00.229 --> 03:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
Katon thank you madam chair and I I
 
03:47:02.399 --> 03:47:03.670 align:start position:0%
Katon thank you madam chair and I I
would

03:47:03.670 --> 03:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:47:07.349 --> 03:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
just say that I think the intent of this
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
bill is to prevent that got you at the
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
last minute that says how do we miss
 
03:47:14.269 --> 03:47:14.279 align:start position:0%
this that's I think that's the intent of
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
the bill is to prevent what you just
 
03:47:19.950 --> 03:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
said it does m Madam chair I I certainly
 
03:47:21.550 --> 03:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
agree with the representative that
 
03:47:23.670 --> 03:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the bill but I
 
03:47:25.269 --> 03:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
don't believe that it's necessarily
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
going to deliver on on that hope and for
 
03:47:30.710 --> 03:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
that reason I'm I'm I'm representative
 
03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair just like to
 
03:47:35.229 --> 03:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
remind my colleagues on the committee
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
that as we discussed in our last session
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
this is not at all un common and quite
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
the opposite is quite common for States
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
actually to have a TW stage permitting
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
process for exactly these reasons and it
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
works so uh it is not as I said um it's
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
far from unheard of in the business and
 
03:47:55.510 --> 03:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
businesses who work as they do here in
 
03:47:57.630 --> 03:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and other states are
 
03:48:00.670 --> 03:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
entirely familiar with Stage permitting
 
03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
processes representative H Haskins thank
 
03:48:06.550 --> 03:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um yes building on what
 
03:48:08.670 --> 03:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
my colleague uh representative jamana
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
just said this is is a short application
 
03:48:13.950 --> 03:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
this initial permit application is a
 
03:48:18.469 --> 03:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
short application just to get rid of any
 
03:48:21.630 --> 03:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
disqualifying um criteria that would be
 
03:48:24.510 --> 03:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
unsuitable for a landfill and that
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
indeed is what other states do as well
 
03:48:27.239 --> 03:48:28.070 align:start position:0%
indeed is what other states do as well
thank

03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:48:30.269 --> 03:48:30.279 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:48:32.750 --> 03:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
rville but Madam chair if that was if
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
that was correct then why would a second
 
03:48:38.830 --> 03:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
phase be required if the first if the
 
03:48:41.389 --> 03:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
first phase is to ensure that that
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
everything checks out to proceed with a
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
project then why why do you need the
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
second phase well that's the way I
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
interpret your your remarks and and if I
 
03:48:50.189 --> 03:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
misunderstood I apologize representative
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
H Haskins a short application is a short
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
application so of course it doesn't go
 
03:48:57.070 --> 03:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
through all the criteria we are giving
 
03:49:00.189 --> 03:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
Dees a lot of latitude here we're not
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
putting stringent requirements on them
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're just saying in this initial short
 
03:49:08.670 --> 03:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
application the first permit application
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
are there disqualifying criteria that
 
03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
they could go back to the um applicant
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
with and they'd still have time to
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
adjust if adjustment were feasible and
 
03:49:24.269 --> 03:49:24.279 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of process that we
 
03:49:26.590 --> 03:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
think our state deserves just like other
 
03:49:28.830 --> 03:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
States Representative Murray uh thank
 
03:49:32.070 --> 03:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um to um that point I
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
there are many circumstances in which
 
03:49:36.189 --> 03:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
preliminary application phases um do
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
exist for other types of things and I
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
think the members uh representative hot
 
03:49:43.389 --> 03:49:43.399 align:start position:0%
skins is exactly correct um sometimes an
 
03:49:45.149 --> 03:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
entity will come back and say hey we
 
03:49:46.590 --> 03:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
need you to address these things or
 
03:49:49.630 --> 03:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
enumerate this a little bit more and um
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
in addition to just um so I think there
 
03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
are two ways in which something like
 
03:49:56.950 --> 03:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
this could be used for for remedying an
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
error or an oversight or then also where
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's a a a grave concern of some
 
03:50:05.429 --> 03:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
other nature thank you okay any other
 
03:50:07.990 --> 03:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative ktoa thank you
 
03:50:11.070 --> 03:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
so Dees is writing the rules right
 
03:50:18.990 --> 03:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
now okay and if this was so important
 
03:50:21.550 --> 03:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
this preliminary process why does it
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:33.030 --> 03:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
poens so this isn't this isn't in effect
 
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
until July 1 2025 it's basically saying
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
that if Dees needs more time now we're
 
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
giving them to have the rules completed
 
03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
until July 21 2025 right now the rules
 
03:50:53.349 --> 03:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be done in July of 2024
 
03:50:55.790 --> 03:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's the line on the back that's what
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's speaking to not about this
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
preliminary process can I speak on
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:07.750 --> 03:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
sure we all know that um in a perfect
 
03:51:09.790 --> 03:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
world that
 
03:51:13.590 --> 03:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
corporations industry um are always
 
03:51:15.070 --> 03:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
working on the you know the best
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
interests of people but just in New
 
03:51:18.790 --> 03:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alone and this isn't even
 
03:51:21.429 --> 03:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
talking about landfill we all know what
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
happened with s gobain that is now like
 
03:51:28.149 --> 03:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
poisoned an entire region of the state
 
03:51:30.149 --> 03:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
we know that there's many times that
 
03:51:34.750 --> 03:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
there's profits over people and so for
 
03:51:37.269 --> 03:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
you know just on in representative
 
03:51:39.269 --> 03:51:39.279 align:start position:0%
verville's you know just in responding
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
to that we can't be naive to that so
 
03:51:45.910 --> 03:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
having a a preliminary and if someone's
 
03:51:48.110 --> 03:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
going to try to you know push something
 
03:51:50.750 --> 03:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
through that is right on the cusp of not
 
03:51:52.990 --> 03:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
being a a real proper location for a
 
03:51:55.710 --> 03:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
landfill then you know it's a good thing
 
03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
it's just putting another layer in to
 
03:52:00.590 --> 03:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
protect you know everybody that's
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
involved so I think that we can't be
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
naive to the fact that um not
 
03:52:07.149 --> 03:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
everybody's always looking out for the
 
03:52:08.710 --> 03:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
best interest of the citizens of New
 
03:52:08.720 --> 03:52:09.910 align:start position:0%
best interest of the citizens of New
Hampshire

03:52:09.910 --> 03:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:52:09.920 --> 03:52:10.710 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
thank

03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
you representative verville yeah Madam
 
03:52:16.149 --> 03:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
chair I apologize I I I I think I I
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
missed something of of rather weighty
 
03:52:22.149 --> 03:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
importance so the effective date of the
 
03:52:25.149 --> 03:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
bill is 2025 the rules are supposed to
 
03:52:28.269 --> 03:52:28.279 align:start position:0%
be completed in 2024 so if this if this
 
03:52:32.269 --> 03:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
bill passes and becomes law will that
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
potentially Kick the Can down the road
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
on the deadline for the new
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:39.870 align:start position:0%
on the deadline for the new
rules

03:52:39.870 --> 03:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:52:39.880 --> 03:52:41.990 align:start position:0%
rules
represent

03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:52:44.469 --> 03:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
Potenza it doesn't kick the can down the
 
03:52:46.389 --> 03:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
road it's basically saying that if this
 
03:52:49.389 --> 03:52:49.399 align:start position:0%
goes into effect and they they have more
 
03:52:51.790 --> 03:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
time if they need them for the for the
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
rules that's it that's giving them more
 
03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
time if Dees needs more time it extends
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
the deadline for them Madam shair
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
represent vervo so I I I appreciate the
 
03:53:05.750 --> 03:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
answer but it it sounds to me like the
 
03:53:08.189 --> 03:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
short answer is is yes that if this
 
03:53:10.630 --> 03:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
becomes law instead of having to have
 
03:53:14.590 --> 03:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
the new rules in place next year it
 
03:53:17.309 --> 03:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
potentially adds another year for for
 
03:53:19.950 --> 03:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
new rules and and that's for me that's
 
03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
another reason to be a no thank you
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair representative Murray uh
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair if I'm looking at
 
03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
on the amendment on page two line two it
 
03:53:32.229 --> 03:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
says or until the reopt rules are
 
03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
effective so I think that there is the
 
03:53:36.229 --> 03:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to just continue
 
03:53:37.630 --> 03:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
along as they are
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
now thank you than you all right you
 
03:53:43.710 --> 03:53:43.720 align:start position:0%
know um in term again uh in the interest
 
03:53:47.070 --> 03:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
of time uh I'm going to call ask the

for this year Madam chair just a quick
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
question if I may sure representative H
 
03:57:53.389 --> 03:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
Haskins um so in order to go on the
 
03:57:58.110 --> 03:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
consent calendar does a bill have to be
 
03:58:01.710 --> 03:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
um you have to have unanimous support
 
03:58:04.750 --> 03:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay or I believe it's either one you
 
03:58:09.870 --> 03:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
can have one person against but okay so
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
could be 182 also so if there if if uh
 
03:58:16.269 --> 03:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
if there are one or two people voting
 
03:58:18.670 --> 03:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
against it it can still go on consent if
 
03:58:21.389 --> 03:58:21.399 align:start position:0%
those people who voted against it say
 
03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
