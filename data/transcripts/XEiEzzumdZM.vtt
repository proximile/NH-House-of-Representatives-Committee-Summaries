session it's an organizational meeting
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
to decide what we're going to do about
 
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.070 align:start position:0%
to decide what we're going to do about
six

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
bills that we
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
retained in committee for interim study
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll go through those bills one by
 
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.550 align:start position:0%
and we'll go through those bills one by
one

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
and decide how we want to proceed
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
proceed if we decide to set up
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittees then we will form those
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and ask for
 
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.629 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and ask for
volunteers

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
now carrie our
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee admin
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
and i had discussed probably two weeks
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
ago now
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
the possibility that she would provide
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
copies of all the bills
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh this morning
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
and she forgot
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
but i double checked with her she's
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
working on it and she will be bringing
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
in copies of all the bills
 
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
in copies of all the bills
here

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.950 align:start position:0%
here
shortly

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
the the project managers among us will
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
have supplied their own copies
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's unusual to have a committee session
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
where there's more people in the
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
audience than there are members of the
 
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
audience than there are members of the
committee

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
in attendance but part of that is
 
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.550 align:start position:0%
in attendance but part of that is
because

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
the speaker scheduled a leadership
 
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.830 align:start position:0%
the speaker scheduled a leadership
meeting

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
opposite this meeting so representative
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
thomas representative notter
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
possibly representative harrington are
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the leadership meeting
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
and they will join us once that meeting
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
is complete
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
now we will conclude this meeting no
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
later than 11 45 because at 12 o'clock
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're scheduled for
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
a committee lunch at cheers and we hope
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh all members of the committee will be
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
able to to join us for that
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
goodbye lunch for um
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
the second year of our
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
and there is kristin who will be joining
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
us for lunch i hope
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
and carrie also will be joining us for
 
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.589 align:start position:0%
and carrie also will be joining us for
lunch

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
so with that we can start now and we're
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to go through these bills
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the order they are listed
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
they were listed in the calendar so the
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
first bill in the calendar was house
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
bill 1248
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.870 align:start position:0%
which is a
bill

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
relative to the placement power for net
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
metering customer generators now this
 
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.509 align:start position:0%
metering customer generators now this
bill

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
as you'll recall from the committee
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
and subsequent debate an exec session
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
was basically just an idea
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
it had
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
outlined in the legislation
 
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.670 align:start position:0%
outlined in the legislation
so

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
in classic
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
legislative fashion it really does need
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of interim study because there
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
was no possibility that the bill could
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
move forward otherwise
 
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.829 align:start position:0%
move forward otherwise
so

00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest that we do
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
form a subcommittee for this
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the fall
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
have that sub committee have at least
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
one meeting on the subject to try to uh
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
put something together representative
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
oxenam did you ever comment a question
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's my memory from our public hearing
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill was based on a
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
misconception that somehow
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
solar small solar generators were
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to be um on the hook for for
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
doing certain things at certain times
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
i i see no point in the committee
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
spending any time on this bill it was it
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
was a death with dignity vote to say
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
but i i see no point in taking up
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee time
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
ah looks like we might be getting copies
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the bills here shortly
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you gary
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
any further comment
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
the possibility that we might create an
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittee for interim study on
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
this bill representative partial
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
i would con um concur with uh
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative oxfam that i think this
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill needs to have more substance before
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
any further comment representative mcgee
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll i'll echo what was said and um
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
and think the concept of the bill
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
was to say that
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
that these small customer generators
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
would have to provide their replacement
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
power right and it and it came up in the
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
hearing when
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
when the representative white testified
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
on it that the export grid obligations
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
there is no grid obligation because
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
those producers are considered
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
load reducers right and and so we
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the advantage of people
 
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.630 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the advantage of people
independently

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
independently
 
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.509 align:start position:0%
independently
um

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:40.550 align:start position:0%
um
creating

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
creating
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
local generation
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
change the paradigm and i think this was
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
a bill that was
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
trying to explore something and and i
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
have no problem with that but i don't i
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
don't think any interim study would
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
provide us with any solution
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
along these lines because it's it's not
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
really a tenable position
 
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.949 align:start position:0%
really a tenable position
having

00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
a grid export obligation from
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
intermittent sources is just the
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
opposite it it's the antithesis of the
 
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.949 align:start position:0%
opposite it it's the antithesis of the
point

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
the point is
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to create that
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
intermittent power
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
in order to lower demand
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have anything to do with them
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
being on the hook for
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
grid exports
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
so they're just two different animals i
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
before we
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
go on any further i would remind
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
everybody that
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
when it comes to interim study bills at
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
this point in the session
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
there are only two determinations that
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
we can make one is
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
we recommend that this bill be
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
the subject of
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
or the other option is to recommend that
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
this bill not be
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
the subject for
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.550 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah obviously some of you feel that it
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
should not be the subject of future
 
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.069 align:start position:0%
should not be the subject of future
legislation

00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
but the question in my mind is since
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's so
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
underdeveloped and there are so many
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions that are outstanding
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
how can the committee know for sure one
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
way or the other whether it should
 
00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:26.870 align:start position:0%
way or the other whether it should
recommend

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
for or not for future
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
legislation if we don't know what the
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
answers to the questions are
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki i thank you mr
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
chairman i think that i don't know
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
whether the committee or a subcommittee
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
could add any value to this basically
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
some it's somebody's idea and that
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
somebody is the one who has to provide
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
the impetus rather than us trying to do
 
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.230 align:start position:0%
the impetus rather than us trying to do
so

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative oxenoum
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity for new
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
legislation in the fall if if there's an
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
idea here and needs pursuing the sponsor
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
can bring it forward again but i i see
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay any further comment
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative partial yes thank you
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's sort of a general question we're
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
looking at uh six uh potential study
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
groups here
 
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.629 align:start position:0%
groups here
um

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
and we are all looking at i believe
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
limited resources within this committee
 
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.430 align:start position:0%
limited resources within this committee
um

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
we are not going to be prioritizing
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
these as to the
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
importance of as far as necessity for
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
if i'm being clear or not
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
sorry what was the question again
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
we have six uh bills recommended for
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering about the resources we
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
have to apply to those uh basic study
 
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.310 align:start position:0%
have to apply to those uh basic study
groups

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
groups
 
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.910 align:start position:0%
groups
and

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
is there any point going through all six
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
spills and seeing which ones weigh the
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
heavy heaviliest and have the strongest
 
00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
heavy heaviliest and have the strongest
need

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing today yeah we're
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
not going to decide right now whether or
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
not we're going to disclude house bill
 
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.470 align:start position:0%
not we're going to disclude house bill
1248

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
1248
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
we're not oh okay thank you so we're not
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're just going to go through these get
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
a senses a consensus of
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
of how we feel about these bills
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
probably along about 11 o'clock or so
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
we'll decide yes or no on whether we're
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to do anything representative
 
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.030 align:start position:0%
going to do anything representative
pementel

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
pementel
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't just need a tweak it needs to be
 
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't just need a tweak it needs to be
rewritten

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
rewritten
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
maybe even a different subject matter so
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
it just
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:47.189 align:start position:0%
should be
round

00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
round
 
00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:48.150 align:start position:0%
round
uh

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:58.550 align:start position:0%
uh
filed

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none let's move on to
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
the next bill we're doing the house
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
bills first and then we'll do the senate
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
bills so this will be house bill 1635 fn
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
which is an act relative to the purchase
 
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.389 align:start position:0%
which is an act relative to the purchase
of

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
output of limited electrical energy
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
producers and including qualified
 
00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:24.069 align:start position:0%
producers and including qualified
storage

00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:27.189 align:start position:0%
storage
system

00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
we sent this bill to interim study
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
because there was a senate bill
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
which was if you'll refresh my 321
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill 321 which we passed
 
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.269 align:start position:0%
senate bill 321 which we passed
uh

00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
that superseded this bill
 
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.790 align:start position:0%
that superseded this bill
so

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the case of this bill i would suggest
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
is not would not be recommended for
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
further study but i'm open to other
 
00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:03.509 align:start position:0%
further study but i'm open to other
comments

00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
did 321 make it through
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
yes going for governor yeah 321 should
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
be on its way to the governor maybe it's
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
already signed he signed
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
something like 56 bills a couple days
 
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.870 align:start position:0%
something like 56 bills a couple days
ago

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
yeah well i'm okay with not studying it
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
if that's the case
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yes i concur we've
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
already dealt with this issue with the
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
senate bill this is no need for us to
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
future comments further comments
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative can anyone answer for me
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
whether the storage language ended up in
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
the final version of 321 because i know
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
that was one of the goals of the
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
language when we were first discussing
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
it was that storage was not accommodated
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
yet in the statute and so there was an
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
interest in adding it and i think 321
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
had that language but i don't know where
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
it landed so i was just wondering if
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
anybody knows
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
it was in the bill
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh and we made no changes to the bill
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
other than
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
an amendment that we added and the
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
senate concurred with that amendment
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine could we ask our
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
assistant to just check the senate
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
amendment the
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
the bill in its final form to see if
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
that language sure thank you very much
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
any further comments about
 
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.390 align:start position:0%
any further comments about
1635

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
consensus seems to be that we would not
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on then
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
the next one is a big one it's house
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
bill 1644 this is the
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
5 g bill that was introduced by
 
00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:57.350 align:start position:0%
5 g bill that was introduced by
representative

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
pat abrami
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's relative to the placement of
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
telecommunications antenna and
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
establishing a registry for residents
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
who are experiencing biological symptoms
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
from with from wireless radiation
 
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.549 align:start position:0%
from with from wireless radiation
exposure

00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a pretty widespread
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
consensus that we want to do something
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
with this bill representative callie
 
00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:25.830 align:start position:0%
with this bill representative callie
pitts

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
i believe that representative myrna
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
was going to
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
form a study committee and i think we
 
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:35.750 align:start position:0%
form a study committee and i think we
should

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of things that
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
we hear
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about i read so much
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
conflicting information
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
i really need to get
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
the other side of the story
 
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.270 align:start position:0%
the other side of the story
and

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit more about what
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
5g is so i would recommend that this
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'd remind members to turn your
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
microphone off if you're not speaking
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
representative wiki thank you mr
 
00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:07.029 align:start position:0%
representative wiki thank you mr
chairman

00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
we keep using the term 5g and it makes
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
my teeth itch because it's a misnomer
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is various
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
frequencies and various
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
a very wide range of frequencies over
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
which cell phones operate from eight
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
mega uh 800 megahertz to at least 23
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
gigahertz that's an enormous spread and
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
radiation in those bands behaves very
 
00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:33.669 align:start position:0%
radiation in those bands behaves very
differently

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
from one band to another and i think we
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
should be focusing on that technical
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
aspect of it
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
rather than an encoding protocol which
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
can be used on any of those frequencies
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
i really would like us to go in that
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
direction and i am certainly willing to
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
so representative thomas who's not here
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
at the moment but we'll be here in a
 
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.390 align:start position:0%
at the moment but we'll be here in a
shortly

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
and representative abrami who was the
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
original sponsor of this bill
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
have requested
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we form a subcommittee
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
to study this issue further
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
and representative thomas has requested
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
that we have the first meeting of that
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee next tuesday which is may
 
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.950 align:start position:0%
subcommittee next tuesday which is may
31st

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
31st
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm okay with that
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
sounds reasonable to me so
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
i think we will definitely have a
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this bill
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
and i will open it to anybody who wants
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
to participate to be a member of that
 
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.470 align:start position:0%
to participate to be a member of that
subcommittee

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative thomas will be there
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative abrami i'm going to
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
appoint to that subcommittee
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
and anybody else on this committee who
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
wants to be on that subcommittee
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
all you have to do is notify myself or
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative thomas and you will be
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
added as official members of that
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative callie pitts
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if the chair would
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
maybe run it by somebody from health and
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
since i do believe that
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
as well as being a technical issue this
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
is a health issue
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
at least so they would be aware of
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea thank you very much for
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
that suggestion i'll consult with
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative pearson who's the chair
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
of hh the hhs committee and see if
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
there's anybody on his committee who
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
might have an interest in participating
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
on that committee
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam thank you mr chair
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
it's a lovely idea to have anyone who
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
wants to participate but sometimes we do
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
get into situations where
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
voting matters um in the previous
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
anybody could attend and anybody could
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
participate but when it came to voting
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
it was only the members of the committee
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
who voted it seems to me that
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
that could become an issue
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm just suggesting that
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
you might want to think about that as
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're setting up the committee
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's a good point thank you for raising
 
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.549 align:start position:0%
it's a good point thank you for raising
that

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
because there's only two options here
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
either recommend for future legislation
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
or not recommend for future legislation
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
i think that whatever the committee the
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee comes up with
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
we are all going to get a chance to vote
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
on the final outcome
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
and so it's maybe not as as big an issue
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
as it might otherwise have been
 
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.789 align:start position:0%
as it might otherwise have been
but

00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
my prediction would be
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
having had several conversations with
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative thomas about this
 
00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:49.190 align:start position:0%
representative thomas about this
that

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
the committee will recommend future
 
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.630 align:start position:0%
the committee will recommend future
legislation

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
and it might even recommend
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
certain types of future legislation
 
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.590 align:start position:0%
certain types of future legislation
so

00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
that is a very likely outcome of the
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i shouldn't maybe prejudice
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
its outcome ahead of time but
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
it seems likely to me that that that
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
would be the direction that the
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
so could i have a show of hands of
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
people in this uh
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
room right now who would like to be on
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%

00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
oxenum

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:45.990 align:start position:0%
 
loicky

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative okay thank you
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um i think that
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative white had some
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
significant knowledge to offer on this i
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative berezne wants to be
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
on the committee representative bernardi
 
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.750 align:start position:0%
on the committee representative bernardi
no

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
okay that's a pretty representative
 
00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:22.149 align:start position:0%
okay that's a pretty representative
group

00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
so in addition to representative thomas
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
that'll be eight people on the
 
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.149 align:start position:0%
that'll be eight people on the
subcommittee

00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
pending the outcome of my discussion
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
with representative pearson
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
about an hhs person
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
so eight or nine members i think would
 
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.110 align:start position:0%
so eight or nine members i think would
be

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
a good solid
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
a direction a future direction for
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
legislation based on
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
the original hb 1644 any further
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
discussion of
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
just real quick do you happen to know if
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas has decided on
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
the time on tuesday morning
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
nine versus ten perhaps or
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll ask him when he gets back in
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
here thanks very much i suspect it'll be
 
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.830 align:start position:0%
here thanks very much i suspect it'll be
10

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
but he will have to make that decision
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
today because
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
we have to get a notice in the calendar
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
and it has to be
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
done by noon tomorrow so
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
we'll make that he'll make that decision
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
later today he may have already made it
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
we'll see when he gets here
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
we're mowing these down pretty quickly
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
we might be out of here by
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
all right so let's move on
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
now we'll go to the senate bills
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the first one would be senate bill
 
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.830 align:start position:0%
and the first one would be senate bill
259

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.149 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
agreed in a
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee of conference to
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
add language to
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1258
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
that was substantively similar to the
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
language in this bill
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
whereas this bill called for
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:36.310 align:start position:0%
 
where

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
a definition of political subdivision
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
could mean the state of new hampshire
 
00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.430 align:start position:0%
could mean the state of new hampshire
or

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
a variety of other
 
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.510 align:start position:0%
a variety of other
entities

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
entities
in

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
house bill 1258
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
the language we added was simply the
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is now considered
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
in the definition of
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
political subdivision for the purposes
 
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.870 align:start position:0%
political subdivision for the purposes
of

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
municipal hosting
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr chair
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
as i recall the conversation there was
 
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.170 align:start position:0%
some question around um
 
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.549 align:start position:0%
some question around um
[Music]

00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
there was a question of quasi-public
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
entity being too vague and people didn't
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
understand what that meant
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i sort of went and looked up
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
that definition and it it's a fairly
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
well qualified thing but i think that
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
the senate was trying to add housing
 
00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:39.029 align:start position:0%
the senate was trying to add housing
authorities

00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
public entities and the p's development
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
authority for specific purposes so i
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
don't know if we ever got any answers on
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
the house side as to why they were
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
trying to adopt that language or whether
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
it is of value
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
but i know we're just talking about
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to do a subcommittee
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
or not but i guess the point would be
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
whether there was something they were
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve that we have not yet
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
achieved that's the only reason i would
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
want to hang on to it
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
i do not know what the
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
reason was for including please peace
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
development authority it's a good
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
question to ask i agree
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
hang on to this bill
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
we would simply write a new bill with
 
00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:27.190 align:start position:0%
we would simply write a new bill with
new

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
more direct language as what we want i
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
think we when i was looking at this one
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire or any city
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
town county school district we just have
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
write a brand new bill
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
that would affirm what that is and i
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think we know that already
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's awesome well you're absolutely
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
right that no matter
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
what we recommend recommend here whether
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
we recommend future legislation or not
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to require a new bill next
 
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.190 align:start position:0%
it's going to require a new bill next
year

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
so if we say yes
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
we think this
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
is a good subject for future legislation
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
that would have to happen anyway because
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
this bill itself dies on october
 
00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
this bill itself dies on october
26th

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
26th
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of of what we we choose or
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
october 28th whatever the deadline is
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine did you have
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
i'm a little taken aback by your october
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%

back and allow you to
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
explain that further before i make my

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
so on that day or before we have to have
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
filed a report that says
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
sb 259 is recommended or not recommended
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
for future legislation
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
so that's what that's the deadline thank
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
you it wasn't anything particular to
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
this bill that you were suggesting it
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
was just the the common
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
deadline for all interim study bills
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for clarifying that
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
there were two issues with this bill one
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
was the addition of particular entities
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
such as quasi public entity and we were
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
informed that that was particularly
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
directed to the university of new
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire system and the community
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
college systems
 
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.230 align:start position:0%
college systems
but

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
in certain negotiations outside of
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
committee there was a discussion at
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
least of
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
not proceeding with those particular
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
aspects but focusing on the deletion of
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
the one line the one sentence on lines
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
eight through ten
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
this particular sentence is a real
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
problem we have had no uptake of this
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
possibility that was presented to
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the counties
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
and now the state of new hampshire
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
because it is so limiting not only i you
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
know i
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
anybody remembers the the color
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
coordinated map our towns are not big
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
enough to have the load necessary within
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
their boundaries to act particularly
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
many of our towns have overlapping
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
utility territories
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
when you say it they all group members
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
have to be within the same utility
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
territory and they have to be within the
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
same municipality you have made this a
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
null category
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
for any but the very largest cities and
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
our very largest cities don't have the
 
00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:49.669 align:start position:0%
our very largest cities don't have the
terrain

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
terrain
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
to actually
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
go out and often i i won't say it
 
00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:55.269 align:start position:0%
go out and often i i won't say it
completely

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
a it's a difficulty in a built-up area
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
in in my partic my district we have a
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
perfect place to put a solar array we
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
have towns that are committed to
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
transitioning to alternative energy
 
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.389 align:start position:0%
transitioning to alternative energy
this

00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
this rsa would make it possible for them
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
to do something very positive but only
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
this restriction which really is
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
incompatible and and we discussed this
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
that you're saying it has to be within a
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
certain one single municipality but this
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
the state could be an entity and the
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
county could be the entity so
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
eliminating this one sentence i think i
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
think it is worthwhile for us to have
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
this study so that we could proceed
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
because this this really is a matter of
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
state importance
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i i agree with you that that
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
maybe we should
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
allowing multiple multiple
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be in a
 
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.230 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be in a
group

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
a municipal host group is a good thing
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
or not and what it what what the
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
implications would be how much it would
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
cost etc
 
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.629 align:start position:0%
cost etc
um

00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's a valid
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
area for future study i would think and
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
possible future legislation as well so
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
is there any appetite amongst committee
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
members for forming a subcommittee to
 
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
members for forming a subcommittee to
study

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
apparently so so
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
we'll sit
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
seriously consider setting up a
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this one then
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
i have another question it's
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
on contiguous municipalities
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking of portsmouth
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
i'll use portsmouth as an example
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
a community and greenland could join
 
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.510 align:start position:0%
a community and greenland could join
that

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
and newington could join that
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
i believe because now we're in the same
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
political area
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
including newcastle so i just think that
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
we need to get some
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
i agree with we but i think we need to
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
get some concrete areas answers on what
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
because i didn't think you had to be i
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
mean an individual municipality i
 
00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:40.790 align:start position:0%
mean an individual municipality i
thought

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.430 align:start position:0%
thought
contiguous

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
contiguous
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh municipalities could now participate
 
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.069 align:start position:0%
uh municipalities could now participate
together

00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
and no that's not not in this bill
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
the existing legislation does not allow
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
that the definition of municipal group
 
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.390 align:start position:0%
that the definition of municipal group
hosting

00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
hosting
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
restricts it to a single municipality
 
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.670 align:start position:0%
restricts it to a single municipality
and

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of of a future study
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
according to the re recommendation of
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative oxygen would be to
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
discover whether
 
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.390 align:start position:0%
discover whether
um

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
that limitation should be lifted and
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
what the implications of doing that
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
might be is am i correct about that
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative oxenum
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
under the impression that that was
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
either implicit or implied in 315 the
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.550 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.349 align:start position:0%
well
you're

00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
you're confusing maybe the community
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
power aspect
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
municipal group hosting aspect they were
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
both in the same bill because the senate
 
00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:49.030 align:start position:0%
both in the same bill because the senate
added

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment to 315 to add the
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
group municipal hosting piece
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
but they're different entities they're
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
not the same thing
 
00:36:59.359 --> 00:37:07.109 align:start position:0%
not the same thing
um

00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
i i'll allow you to make that comment
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
but please turn on your mic for
 
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.829 align:start position:0%
but please turn on your mic for
clarification

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
yep i was just saying one is designed to
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
move across municipal lines and the
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
other one still has an exclusion that
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
says it is not
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
correct so that's why it's confusing
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
because they were both lumped together
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the same bill but they're two
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
different programs essentially
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
and this one
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
as representative oxenon points out
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
the group groupnet
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
metering municipal hosting program may
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
still be
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
a little too limited
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
in order to be effective and so we ought
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
to study whether that's the case or not
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that i think it's a
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
let me have a show of hands of people
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
who would be willing to serve on a
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to look into this question
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:14.090 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom
 
00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.910 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom
[Music]

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like we'll go forward with the
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee then to study
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
the questions raised by senate bill 259
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
relative to certain references
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy and
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
transferring authority over the low
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
income electric
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
electricity assistance program to the
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:33.829 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
does anyone on the committee remember
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
or the executive session that led us to
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
we had a number of bills dealing with
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
the transfer of authority to department
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
of energy so it's difficult to
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
remember exactly which one this was but
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
i think the the issue here
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
was the low-income
 
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.430 align:start position:0%
was the low-income
uh

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
provisions of reggie that there might
 
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:14.770 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:15.910 align:start position:0%
have been
[Music]

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
an issue there with the puc and and that
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
we thought it deserved a further look
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
but it was not it it wasn't a
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
we really gave a lot of attention to it
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
that that's my recollection
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you it's coming back to me now i
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
think the objection that some members of
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to accumulate
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
year over year
 
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.550 align:start position:0%
year over year
and

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
there was the potential
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
for the amount of money to accumulate in
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
this fund to be
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
substantial is that the way you remember
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
so if accumulating funds in this
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
program was the question or was the
 
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.069 align:start position:0%
program was the question or was the
issue

00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.270 align:start position:0%
issue
then

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
the next question is is this something
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
that we should take a closer look at
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative oxenon
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
we have a tremendous need for
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs and we've had a
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
long history of long long waiting lists
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
waiting lists that are so long that
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
people don't even add their names to the
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
waiting list so the notion that we're
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to have a problem of accumulating
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
money seems to me to be a
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
a very much an
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh a reach to to look for for an issue
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
or a problem our problem has been
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
insufficient funds and too great of need
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
with our current energy crisis with the
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
rising costs of volatile fossil fuels
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
that the best way we can act to help the
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
lower electricity costs is to help them
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
with weatherization
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
and uh at at no time has it been more
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
important for us to make these funds
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
available so i i see no problem about
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
an issue with
 
00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:25.829 align:start position:0%
an issue with
accumulation

00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
accumulation
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
and the other problem is that we have
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
all these strange
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
non-calendar dates when things get
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
reported and things get allocated so
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes you have a disconnect
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
and money gets put into something and
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
then it's not available to be accessed
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't in the same fiscal
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
year or wasn't in some particular
 
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.230 align:start position:0%
year or wasn't in some particular
calendar

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.349 align:start position:0%
calendar
deadline

00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
this having the continuation means that
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
the funds that are there people know
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're there when they're allocated
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
they know they're there when they apply
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh that the people that are out there
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
doing the work can rely on the funding
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
stream it's important for our businesses
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's important for our our constituents
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
i i think that this is
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
is is important
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
and therefore we shouldn't be rocking
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
the boat and putting it under doubt by
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
saying oh maybe we need to study whether
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
or not this is a good idea or not
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
we need to leave this alone and let it
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
let it do the job
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
so you don't do not want to study so i
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
do not think there's any point in
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
starting i think it would be a negative
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
two okay to do that representative
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
i think we need to
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
re-look at this bill or to study it i
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
think one of the problems that comes up
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
is the pre-qualification problem
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
and to me that's a problem
 
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:44.150 align:start position:0%
and to me that's a problem
and

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
reading over what the department of
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
energy says that
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
you know federal funds could be in
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
jeopardy i think we just it bears
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
another look
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay one vote for one vote against
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh a subcommittee representative
 
00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.150 align:start position:0%
uh a subcommittee representative
harrington

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
harrington
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh one thing i would just wanted to
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
mention on this is that we just had the
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
newest puc rule on
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh weatherization and spending energy
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency and i think i can't remember
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what i think was 60 had to go on
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
electric reduction
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh programs
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
65 okay now i know in the past before
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
the rules have changed the utilities
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
came to the puc and said we can't spend
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
the system benefit charge the portion
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
that goes not to commercial but goes to
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
residential because you go into
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
someone's house and you say oh we placed
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
all your light bulbs and now you can buy
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
a new refrigerator but it's going to
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
cost you 400 but we're going to give you
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh 75 towards that they'll say well you
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
know come back in four or five years
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
when my refrigerator breaks
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
and they said they that's where the
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
program got switched and allowed a lot
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
more uh the money being spent on thermal
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
issues so with that new restriction at
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
65 going to electric uh use reduction we
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
may run into this thing where it gets up
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
to that million dollars i just think
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's worth probably looking at a
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
little closer to see if it is going to
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
be an issue i just don't know but but i
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
know in the past it had been and we're
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
not going to 100 to reduce electric
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
consumption with the money but we're
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
doing 65
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
we may find that some of that money just
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative lewicky thank you mr
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
chairman one question i have is excuse
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
me that
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
and i may have a false impression is
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
that typically low-income people are
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
living in rental properties and
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
how it the mechanism for doing that
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
essentially would benefit the landlords
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
who may not actually be low-income
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
it's a good
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
question any further representative
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
partial yes thank you chair
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm reading that where uh
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
if the department of junction
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
accumulates over one million dollars
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
excess is not likely to be substantially
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
reduced the department injury may
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh using a non-adjudicative process uh
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
suspended further collection to me that
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
seems like a reasonable clause
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
but if people would like to see that
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
either the dollar figure
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
or see their language
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
but maybe exchange that rather than may
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
to must
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i could live with that i could
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
think a study group could probably
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
hammer that issue out to the
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
satisfaction of
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
all parties concerned so my
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to go ahead with
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
a study committee on this
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
that and the
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
federal funding i'm concerned about
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
all right let's see a show of hands of
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
people who would
 
00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.190 align:start position:0%
people who would
support

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
one two we're talking
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
264. 264. senate bill 264.
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
people who would support
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
having a subcommittee study the issues
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.630 align:start position:0%
for this bill
one

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to doing a subcommittee
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:22.390 align:start position:0%
for this bill
one

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.589 align:start position:0%
one
two

00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
three four
 
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.270 align:start position:0%
three four
five

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
all right looks like uh
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
the fi the nose out vote the yeses on a
 
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.109 align:start position:0%
the fi the nose out vote the yeses on a
subcommittee

00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
and so what we'll do then is come fall
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
we'll just make a decision one way or
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
we recommend it for future legislation
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
or we don't
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
so that's what that's what we'll do in
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
right before we move on to
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
i would like to ask representative
 
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.910 align:start position:0%
i would like to ask representative
thomas

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
thomas
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
to talk for a few minutes about
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:14.309 align:start position:0%
house bill
1644

00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
1644
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
and his vision for
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
where it's going to go in the future we
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
had a lengthy discussion about it and
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
these people in addition to yourself and
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
as members of a subcommittee and i'm
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to speak to representative pearson
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
to find out if there might be an hhs
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
person who would be
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
interested in serving on the
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so doug if you could tell
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
us a little bit about your vision going
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
forward i know you talked about a may
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
31st meeting if you could tell us when
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
time what time that meeting would be
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh that would be helpful okay um well i
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for when the subcommittee
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
members were being discussed but i know
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
that a couple of days ago representative
 
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
that a couple of days ago representative
partial

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
partial
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
indicated a desire to be on that
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
committee if
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.119 --> 00:49:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't get your name the first time
 
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:25.510 align:start position:0%
i didn't get your name the first time
around

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
i um so my desire is to meet on the 31st
 
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
i um so my desire is to meet on the 31st
to

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
set the stage for
 
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.309 align:start position:0%
set the stage for
possible

00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
other interim study meetings that might
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
occur in the fall
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
my objective is
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
to see if
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
something can be done
 
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.790 align:start position:0%
something can be done
to

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
mitigate people's concerns
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
on what they have
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.790 align:start position:0%
 
business

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
may be able to
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
accommodate at very little or no cost to
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
themselves by just maybe changing a few
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
ideas or maybe
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
doing things one way versus another way
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
to accomplish the same thing that might
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
help but
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
i've asked vendors to come through our
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
lobbies here to come on tuesday to talk
 
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.069 align:start position:0%
lobbies here to come on tuesday to talk
about

00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
ways that they might be able to help
 
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.349 align:start position:0%
ways that they might be able to help
people

00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
not trying to debate whether the
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
technology does or doesn't actually
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
affect them but in what ways can they
 
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.870 align:start position:0%
affect them but in what ways can they
accommodate

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
their technology going forward that can
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
at least help some of these people
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
understand that something's trying to be
 
00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.349 align:start position:0%
understand that something's trying to be
done

00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:42.230 align:start position:0%
done
um

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
and not placing blame on any one thing
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
or another per se
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
just what can we do to help
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know can we put things in a
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
different position can we put things in
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
a different
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
area can things can can
 
00:50:58.319 --> 00:50:59.270 align:start position:0%
area can things can can
some

00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
some distance be used um maybe not as
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
much as what this original bill called
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh called for but something
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
to show the people that they're trying
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
to accommodate something
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
just to see if it's possible
 
00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:14.309 align:start position:0%
just to see if it's possible
and

00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
my expectation
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
for those that come to the meeting on
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
tuesday from
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
the vendor side is
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
i want to hear what
 
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.270 align:start position:0%
i want to hear what
you

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
some ideas
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
of of what could be done i really don't
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
want to hear the same information
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
because we know the same information
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
about what your technical scientific
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
background says we all know that but
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
what can you do
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
to help mitigate
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
some of these people's concerns
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it is
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we can
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
but i want to hear some ideas
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i think based on what we hear on the
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
31st we can perhaps move forward to
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
another meeting in the fall to see
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
if any legislation is required to do
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
anything or maybe not maybe they can do
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
things on their own we're not sure i
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
find out what we can do
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
to show
 
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.230 align:start position:0%
to show
that

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything we can
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
to accommodate people within within
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
reason and within the technical aspects
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
of what they're trying to do i have
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
heard rumors that
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
since our
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
big meetings that we that we had here
 
00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
that they've discovered that some
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
some things aren't working the way that
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
they want to so they may be making some
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
changes that's fine i want to hear about
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
that too so that's that's my vision it's
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
just how can how can the vendors show us
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to you know
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
help these people in one way or another
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
just so that we can see what's what's
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
going forward aside from that that's
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's my goal to start on the 31st and
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
again that will dictate what we do in
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
what time on the 31st
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh well i
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
i i would stick to the regular 10
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock meeting
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
give people a chance to come down here
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
okay 10 o'clock on the 31st you've all
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
been alerted
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
it will be in the calendar
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
representative thomas will take care of
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:21.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
any other comment on 1644
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
on okay seeing none
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
we'll now move on to the last bill
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
in our group
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
which is senate bill 269 fn which was a
 
00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.630 align:start position:0%
which is senate bill 269 fn which was a
bill

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
relative to the new hampshire
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
weatherization program
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
reduces contractor pre-qualifications
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
for contracts pertaining to the new
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire weather resistance
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
and calls for the weatherization of
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
repurposed buildings such as mill
 
00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.430 align:start position:0%
repurposed buildings such as mill
buildings

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:12.790 align:start position:0%
buildings
and

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
the question here is
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
does this bill warrant the formation of
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee to study the issues
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative mann has some opinions
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes i've done some um you know
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
back of the envelope
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
financial modeling of
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
statewide energy efficiency
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
value and it's enormous value to
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
to the state we send
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
multi hundreds of millions of dollars
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
and it's all burned up uh and it
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
produces co2
 
00:54:52.799 --> 00:54:55.349 align:start position:0%
produces co2
um

00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
and that could be
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
sharply cut back uh other states have
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
done that and they've been busy on it
 
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.510 align:start position:0%
done that and they've been busy on it
the

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
point that i um
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
made when i sent out i think a paper to
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
when a weatherization program doing one
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
house well and then going to the next
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
one and then to the next and then to the
 
00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:22.470 align:start position:0%
one and then to the next and then to the
next

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
you have an accumulating a lot of
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
steadily growing number of
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh houses that are saying
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
that have cut their
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
oil consumption or their fossil fuel
 
00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.270 align:start position:0%
oil consumption or their fossil fuel
consumption

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.870 align:start position:0%
and um
so

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
whatever weatherization you did five
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
years ago is still producing savings
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
what you did four years ago is still
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
producing savings
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
in three and two and one
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
and when you sketch it out it's an
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
accelerating gain
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
of value to the state to save all that
 
00:55:55.839 --> 00:55:56.789 align:start position:0%
of value to the state to save all that
money

00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:55:56.799 --> 00:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
money
and

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
the investment
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
in weatherization is a straight line
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
you spend the same amount roughly you
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
know as figure averages
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
every year to weatherize more and more
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
houses or maybe the same number of
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
houses are the same
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
amount of reduction in co2 production or
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
and so that's a straight line
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the acceleration
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
of the reduction
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
energy consumption in
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
in homes
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
is a parabola it's an x squared it's a
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
accelerating thing and if you draw the
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
graphs of those two there is absolutely
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
no combination
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
of a straight line graph and a parabola
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
where they do not intersect where
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
the linear
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
growth in
 
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.670 align:start position:0%
growth in
investment

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
investment
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
stays steady
 
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.230 align:start position:0%
stays steady
the

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
savings that you achieve year by year
 
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.230 align:start position:0%
savings that you achieve year by year
accelerate

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
accelerate
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
those curves cross
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
and in a few maybe a decade or so
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
like massachusetts
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
the program is paying for itself
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
paying for itself
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
gap between what's being saved and
 
00:57:26.799 --> 00:57:28.150 align:start position:0%
gap between what's being saved and
what's

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
being invested increases year after year
 
00:57:32.079 --> 00:57:33.670 align:start position:0%
being invested increases year after year
um

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
it may not be three years or five years
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
it might be 50 years it depends on you
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
know the exact cost the conditions of
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
the houses and we'll find that out by
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
doing this but this
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh this committee this commission
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh should be studying
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
the financial aspects
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
we should be this is a very serious
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
thing it's not only serious to the
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
homeowner that has to pay for the fuel
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
but it's serious in our economy if you
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
drain this kind of money out of our
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
economy people have less to spend and
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
everybody loses a little bit
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
we badly need an analysis
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
such as the other states around us have
 
00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:14.950 align:start position:0%
such as the other states around us have
done

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
to understand what the
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
really an economic effect of an energy
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
efficiency program
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
and if it's
 
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.750 align:start position:0%
and if it's
um

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know if it's if it's
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
minor if it's insignificant which is
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
surely not the case
 
00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.630 align:start position:0%
surely not the case
uh

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
you know we can stop worrying about it
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
but i think the outcome of such a study
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial and it would be
 
00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.109 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial and it would be
fact-based

00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
fact-based
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
it would be intellectually sound it
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be just yelling back and forth
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
from one side to the other
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
okay representative harrington
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr speaker maybe someone
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
can help you out a little bit with this
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
bill cause i'm trying to go back here
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
it seems as if the main crux of it is
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the pre-qualification
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
contractors who would be using this the
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
system benefit money or any other state
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
or ratepayer money to
 
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.270 align:start position:0%
or ratepayer money to
install

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
install
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
weatherization at with the businesses or
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
houses and
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
can maybe someone can refresh me what is
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
the issue with this what we have listed
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
here is that they have to have all the
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
licenses necessary they have to have
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
insurance they have to maintain this and
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
so forth and so on what is that what is
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
this going away that's causing
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
apparently causing a problem in this
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
pre-qualification process i just don't
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
remember what it was
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
well if you look at the fiscal note on
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
the back of the
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
a printout of the legislation that we
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
have the department of energy indicated
 
00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:50.230 align:start position:0%
have the department of energy indicated
that

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
criteria in the middle of a program year
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
could jeopardize some federal funding
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that was the primary reason
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
why we decided this bill needed to be
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
studied further it had nothing to do
 
01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.750 align:start position:0%
studied further it had nothing to do
with

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
weatherization per se it was the
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
question of whether there might be some
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
number of federal funds
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
currently the state
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
program receives about 1.9 million in
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
an additional 18.5 million in one-time
 
01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.030 align:start position:0%
an additional 18.5 million in one-time
money

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
from the federal infrastructure bill
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
and non-compliance with the department
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
of energy regulations could result in
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds not being awarded to the
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
state so that's a that's a question that
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out i guess and a
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason i think for
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
putting this bill into interim study
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so i guess what we're saying is we
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
need to look at the department of energy
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
regulations and see if we're violating
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
them because
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it wouldn't just affect
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
doing it in the middle of a funding year
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be back next year the same
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
thing if we're not
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry if we're not in
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
compliance with their regulations we
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
stand to lose federal money and you know
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
how onerous are the regulations i guess
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
is the balancing act if if it costs uh
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
the contractors so much money to
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
pre-qualify that they have to spend on
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
stuff that they're not spending on
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
insulation then you know maybe in the
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
long run the federal money's not worth
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
it but i think it's worth looking into
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
to answer that question
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
i i can't tell by this that's not my
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
point it is hard to tell and that is why
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
the bill was sent to interim study
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
because this is
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's an outstanding question needs to be
 
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.870 align:start position:0%
it's an outstanding question needs to be
addressed

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
and of course there's two department of
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
energies here one is the state
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
department of energy and the other is
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
the national department of energy that
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
apparently their
 
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.349 align:start position:0%
apparently their
pre-qualification

01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
pre-qualification
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
criteria may come into some
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
conflict or
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just the national department
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
of energy criteria recall
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
pre-qualification criteria that's in
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
question here but either way
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
it's a question that needs to be
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
answered representative man
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
i i agree we should be studying this
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
we didn't debate this bill
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
in set in our session
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
it came up
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
it was um recognized a motion to um
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
refer and uh we voted on it immediately
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a word of discussion
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
so i think um
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
at the very least we ought to assign a
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to look into
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
this bill thanks
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
all right how many let's uh have a show
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
of hands how many people think we should
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
have a form a subcommittee for this bill
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
one two
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
three four
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
five six
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
seven eight
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
okay eight
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to forming a
 
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.950 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to forming a
subcommittee

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%

01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
so we have a
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative group of
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
of folks to serve on this subcommittee
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative thomas i think mr um
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
since uh representative oxnam has
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawn us all from the 1644
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative um
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
nodder would would like to be appointed
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.799 --> 01:05:01.589 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
so it turns out that the copies of the
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
bills that we received this morning
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
were the
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
copies of the bill as introduced
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
amended bills
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
may and in some cases have been quite
 
01:05:29.039 --> 01:05:30.309 align:start position:0%
may and in some cases have been quite
different

01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
and this is one of those bills senate
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
bill 269. apparently the version that we
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
were looking at here is quite different
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
from the amended version
 
01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.109 align:start position:0%
from the amended version
and

01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
griffin robarge from the department of
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
energy is here today and is willing to
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
discuss with us
 
01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.309 align:start position:0%
discuss with us
the

01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:49.670 align:start position:0%
the
senate

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
passed version of the bill to give us
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
an idea what the differences might be
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're still going to study the bill i
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
think but
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
mr robarge would you like to help us out
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
figure out what additional topics we
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
need to study
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman votes members of the
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
committee for the record griffin roberge
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
i simply just wanted to note that it
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
appeared that the committee's discussion
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
was centering around senate bill 269 fn
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
as introduced
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
that bill was significantly amended by
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
the senate to just
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
turn into a proposed study commission
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
that would quote
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
establish a commission to study methods
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
of participation for maintaining an
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
energy savings weatherization program
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
to assist in lowering the overall energy
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
consumption for new hampshire families
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
again a commission versus what you have
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
in front of you i think you'd agree
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
might be significantly different i just
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
simply wanted to make the committee
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
good thank you for bringing that to our
 
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.589 align:start position:0%
good thank you for bringing that to our
country

01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:06:53.599 --> 01:06:54.390 align:start position:0%
country
again

01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
what was that could you repeat yeah i'm
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
just reading the bill analysis it
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
establishes a commission to study
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
methods of participation
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
for maintaining an energy savings
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
weatherization program
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
to assist in lowering the overall energy
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
consumption for new hampshire families
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
if it helps at all i can certainly
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
forward along a copy of the amended bill
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee following this meeting
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think that'll be necessary
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
because we've already decided we're
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
going to have a study subcommittee to
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
look at it just letting you just letting
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
everybody know okay thank you appreciate
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
that thank you presentative man
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts did you
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
apparently not
 
01:07:35.839 --> 01:07:37.670 align:start position:0%
apparently not
okay

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
all right so we figured out we're going
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to have us a subcommittee to
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
look at this bill before we make a
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation i i would think the
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to
 
01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:50.230 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to
to

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
the amended version of the bill
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
we have to figure out what
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
triggered our concern about it and then
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
figure out how to address that
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
in our report recommending future
 
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.829 align:start position:0%
in our report recommending future
legislation

01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
so any further comment about that
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused and i it would
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
have been nice if we'd had the text of
 
01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.349 align:start position:0%
have been nice if we'd had the text of
that

01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
that
of

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
before us
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
i you know if if the concern was about
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal participation of propane and you
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
know i remember that discussion people
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
going what in the you know what does
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
that even mean that's not the bill
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
anymore that that's not the subject and
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
there would be that would not be
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
something that the interim study group
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
would be looking at the interim study
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
group is only looking at whether or not
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
to have a commission on participation
 
01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.030 align:start position:0%
to have a commission on participation
it

01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.189 align:start position:0%
it
it

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
no the interim study group
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
would look at the bill
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate which was the one
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
passed judgment on not not the
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
introduced version that we're looking at
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
here right
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
and the the committee would the
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would have to decide
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
do we want to recommend this for future
 
01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:11.269 align:start position:0%
do we want to recommend this for future
legislation

01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
or not but but this is a commission
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
to study participation yes
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
but of course the devil's always in the
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
details right so
 
01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:23.590 align:start position:0%
details right so
um

01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
let's say for example that the bill and
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
i don't remember this because i don't
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
have it right in front of me but let's
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
say for example that the bill
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.470 align:start position:0%
talked about
um

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.510 align:start position:0%
um
monetizing

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
trying to remember the language of the
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
bill figuring out how to get propane and
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
oil to participate in weatherization
 
01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.630 align:start position:0%
oil to participate in weatherization
programs

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.669 align:start position:0%
programs
and

01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
if the committee wanted to recommend the
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
bill for future legislation it could
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
recommend that it do so by striking that
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
language by removing that those
 
01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.310 align:start position:0%
language by removing that those
references

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay so representative mcgee is going to
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
read us the exact language i'm sorry
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i just went
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
back and checked and the version that i
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
have is as amended by the senate so i
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
have the senate amended version and it's
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
not in the little tiny print either
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
so and it's the same language that um mr
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
roberts read for us on the amended
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
analysis page so i do have that bill and
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
it does include that language still
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
um and and all it really says is that um
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know it's listing the duties of the
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
committee and one of the duties is
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
policy direction to further prioritize
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
weatherization within the existing new
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire saves programs
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
and research to explore expanding the
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal participation of propane and oil
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
users in new hampshire in the same
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
manner as electric and natural gas
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
and i do think that was something that
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
was that people said oh that's what this
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
is about but i think it does make sense
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
for us to at least look at the
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
participation because if you spread
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
things further they cost less
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
individually and
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
and it it's similar to
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're having with the
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
gas tax you know as the money goes down
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
in one area we we don't secure as much
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
in order to provide money for these
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
programs so
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
i i think it's just another part of the
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
analysis that they decided to include
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
that we look at it so um so that is all
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
still in here
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
this is as amended by the senate that's
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
i i think i'm understanding
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
participation in a different in a
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
different way now
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
yeah okay it does it does
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
make some sense there's two words there
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal participation which
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
definitely means
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
figuring out a way to tax oil and gas to
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
get them to participate
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
and that was an issue that the committee
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
had some concerns about
 
01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.669 align:start position:0%
had some concerns about
so

01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
moving forward if we were to recommend
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
future legislation we might recommend it
 
01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.950 align:start position:0%
future legislation we might recommend it
without

01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
language about fiscal participation well
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
i just would as i was
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
i was only reading the first couple here
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
but it does also say they would look at
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
the use of other funding sources such as
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
grant funds
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
and explore the fiscal feasibility of
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
double or triple pane replacement winds
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
so windows insulated doors water heaters
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's basically saying
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
where do we get the best bang for the
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
buck how does everything you know how
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
does it all fit together where should
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
the money be spent i i don't i just
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
just an examination
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think i'm losing my mind but i don't
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
remember ever getting the amended
 
01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.470 align:start position:0%
remember ever getting the amended
version

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
did we
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
yeah the senate was the
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
version that was introduced
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
to us at the public hearing yes the
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
senate amended version was the version
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
that was introduced to us
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
and did it leave out that
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
my main concern was that
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
pre-qualification and did it leave that
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
out it took struck that right yeah
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
because it turned the whole bill
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
basically into a commission
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this uh
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative man yes i i i took the
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
bill as having the right general thrust
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know not that important or not quite
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
an amendment to present that day we
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get a chance to to hear it but
 
01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.030 align:start position:0%
didn't get a chance to to hear it but
um

01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
i think if we follow the general thrust
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
of trying to study
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
what its benefits are how to maximize
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
the benefits how to do it
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
why to do it all of those things whether
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
is what this bill should be about
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
and so for example a bit about getting
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
the propane and
 
01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.030 align:start position:0%
the propane and
oil

01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
oil
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
people to contribute to the thing
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh maybe
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
maybe the contribution of um
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
reducing oil consumption
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
by the state um
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
health of the economy of the state given
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
how much we're sending away to buy oil
 
01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.870 align:start position:0%
how much we're sending away to buy oil
um

01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know handles it so
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think we have to look at this as a
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
general uh it's a first attempt the bill
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think it was well written
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh it didn't sound like a
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
a a legal bill that you know
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
but it had a whole lot of suggestions
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
and a whole lot of
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
good good intentions in it and so i
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
think that's what the way we should look
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
at the bill
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
this in other words the subcommittee
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
make big improvements to that bill
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
and it should not be difficult
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the study would give us a factual
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
and a solid basis for making decisions
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial thank
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
you chair i think you've already decided
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
we're having committee that is true or
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes and uh
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
i i can see there's language here that
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about we have a
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
because the commission recommended
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
commission is
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
in excess of 24 people
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
and i just
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
think it's great to have a large table
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
to have to invite everybody be part of
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
it on the one hand but uh i would hate
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
to try to uh have to schedule it um so i
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
think it's i think it's imperative to
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
have a committee that's to work these
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
kind of things or to have a study uh
 
01:15:43.679 --> 01:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
kind of things or to have a study uh
commission

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
study group
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
before prior to the committee even
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
though it seems a bit strange to have a
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
study group to see if we should have a
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
study group basically
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
well the subcommittee can
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
decide if it wants to recommend this
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill for future legislation it doesn't
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
have to be a commission
 
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.070 align:start position:0%
have to be a commission
the

01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee could say we recommend that
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
the future legislation be x y and z
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily just exactly what the
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
that you might hope recommended so
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee can come up with
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
whatever they want you know basically
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
and then then the full committee will
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
have to vote in the fall on the
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's recommendation
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes or no
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
and that will go forward as the report
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
that gets delivered to the clerk
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
about the status of this bill remember
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
we only have two options we can
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
recommend it for future legislation
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
and say why
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
or we cannot recommend it for future
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
legislation and say why that will be the
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
two options that we'll vote on
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you again for clarification um
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding is we also will be able
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
adapt this though now
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
if we if we want to recommend it we can
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
recommend it with
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know if amendment
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
we can amend it and then recommend it
 
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.510 align:start position:0%
we can amend it and then recommend it
no

01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
so all we'll do is we'll say we
 
01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.470 align:start position:0%
so all we'll do is we'll say we
recommend

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:20.810 align:start position:0%
recommend

01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.070 align:start position:0%
sb
[Music]

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
269 for future legislation because
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
we believe that
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
x y and z
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
are important
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
for future legislation or something like
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
that and then of course x y and z will
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
be filled in with actual
 
01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
be filled in with actual
recommendations

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh for future legislation
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then it'll be up to somebody
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
who's an existing or an elected
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
legislator in the fall
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
to introduce such a bill
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.239 --> 01:17:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
pardon

01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative caliph current rep
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
representatives even if they are not
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
coming back can introduce that
 
01:18:06.239 --> 01:18:08.229 align:start position:0%
coming back can introduce that
legislation

01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
i do believe
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
that co-sponsors can pick it up i i do
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
believe that yes someone who is
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
currently in office could file the
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in september if they don't
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
get reelected or choose not to run in
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
november than at one of their
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors could pick up the
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislation i just wanted that clear
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
all right i think we've disposed of all
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
these bills let's go over them one more
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
time to make sure we get it right
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
so senate bill
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
or house bill
 
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.709 align:start position:0%
or house bill
12

01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
12
 
01:18:48.719 --> 01:18:51.189 align:start position:0%
12
48

01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
48
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
i think we should have a uh subcommittee
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
on this but
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of members decided they
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
didn't agree
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
is there anybody who would serve on a
 
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.910 align:start position:0%
is there anybody who would serve on a
subcommittee

01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
i would serve
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who would be
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
nobody okay we're not going to do a
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
study committee on sb
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
48.

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
48.
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
hb 1635 we're not going to do a study

01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
study committee on that
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%

01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
all that
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
hb 259
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
we decided we do want to have a study
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:18.470 align:start position:0%
well i've lost my paperwork on that one
already

01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have i wrote a list on that
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
oh this
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
all right so it looks like
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
we have bernardi mcwilliams mirner mcgee
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
and partial signed up for the
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
very forgiving sure i was under the
 
01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
impression you were asking if i we were
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing a study committee i
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
would be interested in seeing a study
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
committee but already being on
 
01:21:05.679 --> 01:21:08.070 align:start position:0%
committee but already being on
um

01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
oh okay i could do that
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
but you asked me to
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
okay so you do want to be honest it goes
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
on there okay
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
all right so we have bern bernardi
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
i think that you probably would prefer
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
me to be on
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%

01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
originally i did i was happy with the
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill the way it was

01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
1 30 i believe
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's all i know dress to be on the
 
01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.510 align:start position:0%
that's all i know dress to be on the
boat

01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
boat
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
um that's all that's that's all i know
 
01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:46.790 align:start position:0%
um that's all that's that's all i know
really

01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh i suggested that the bus could
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
conceivably make a stop in nashua at the
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
bus station or someplace and pick up
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
people from the south is that possible
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
no i know i at this point i don't think
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
it is the buses only portsmouth and
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
concord were the only buses that they
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
were arranging
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
so if you will get
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
you i um i did get word back that you
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
will not get paid
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
for the out of state travel
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
you will get mileage i should say for
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
in-state um
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
as far as that goes so if you're driving
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
in concord to take up the bus you get
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
models for that
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
i suppose if you're driving from
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere else into
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
portsmouth i think you'll get mileage
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
for that too
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's also important to understand this
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
is apparently a multi-state
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
legislative tour so people from maine
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
will be coming down
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
people from massachusetts and rhode
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
island maybe i don't know so it's not
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
just new hampshire legislators and we're
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
not in control of the of the
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
arrangements that those are being held
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh done by someone else if you have any
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
other questions i would contact kate
 
01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.470 align:start position:0%
other questions i would contact kate
horgan

01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
horgan
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh for anything additional that that's
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
all i know right now
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
don't miss the boat
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative harrington yeah one other
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
quick note uh they brought up this
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
morning the uh uh speaker's ice cream
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
social is going to be thursday so we
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
will have probably an extended lunch
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh during the session on thursday just
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
to plan accordingly and but the thought
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
is we won't be out of here too late
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
after that but it will definitely be a
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
lunch break and we'll be coming back in
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
the afternoon so
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you very much
